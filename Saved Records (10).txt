AB A vast literature suggests that economic inequality has important consequences for politics and public policy. Higher inequality is thought to increase demand for income redistribution in democracies and to discourage democratization and promote class conflict and revolution in dictatorships. Most such arguments crucially assume that ordinary people know how high inequality is, how it has been changing, and where they fit in the income distribution. Using a variety of large, cross-national surveys, we show that, in recent years, ordinary people have had little idea about such things. What they think they know is often wrong. Widespread ignorance and misperceptions emerge robustly, regardless of data source, operationalization, and measurement method. Moreover, perceived inequalitynot the actual levelcorrelates strongly with demand for redistribution and reported conflict between rich and poor. We suggest that most theories about political effects of inequality need to be reframed as theories about effects of perceived inequality.

AB Do human societies from around the world exhibit similarities in the way that they are structured, and show commonalities in the ways that they have evolved? These are long-standing questions that have proven difficult to answer. To test between competing hypotheses, we constructed a massive repository of historical and archaeological information known as "Seshat: Global History Databank." we systematically coded data on 414 societies from SO regions around the world spanning the last 10,000 years. We were able to capture information on 51 variables reflecting nine characteristics of human societies, such as social scale, economy, features of governance, and information systems. Our analyses revealed that these different characteristics show strong relationships with each other and that a single principal component captures around three-quarters of the observed variation. Furthermore, we found that different characteristics of social complexity are highly predictable across different world regions. These results suggest that key aspects of social organization are functionally related and do indeed coevolve in predictable ways. Our findings highlight the power of the sciences and humanities working together to rigorously test hypotheses about general rules that may have shaped human history.

AB Does new media promote accountability in - nondemocratic countries, where offline media is often suppressed? We show that blog posts, which exposed corruption in Russian - state-controlled companies, had a negative causal impact on their market returns. For identification, we exploit the precise timing of blog posts by looking at - within-day results with - company-day fixed effects. Furthermore, we show that the posts are ultimately associated with higher management turnover and less minority shareholder conflicts. Taken together, our results suggest that social media can discipline corruption even in a country with limited political competition and heavily censored traditional media.

AB Do businesspeople who win elected office use their positions to help their firms? Business leaders become politicians around the world, yet we know little about whether their commitment to public service trumps their own private interests. Using an original dataset of 2,703 firms in Russia, I employ a regression discontinuity design to identify the causal effect of firm directors winning seats in subnational legislatures from 2004 to 2013. First, having a connection to a winning politician increases a firm's revenue by 60% and profitability by 15% over a term in office. I then test between different mechanisms, finding that connected firms improve their performance by gaining access to bureaucrats and not by signaling legitimacy to financiers. The value of winning a seat increases in more politically competitive regions but falls markedly when more businesspeople win office in a convocation. Politically connected firms extract fewer benefits when faced with greater competition from other rent-seekers.

AB At a cost of often more than US$10 billion, mega-events such as the Olympic Games and the FIFA Men's World Cup are the single most transformative urban project in many host cities for decades. This article develops an analytical matrix for comparing the impacts of these events on cities and proposes a case survey method to apply this matrix to six recent sports mega-events: the Olympic Games in Vancouver, London, Sochi, and Rio de Janeiro and the FIFA Men's World Cups in South Africa and Brazil. We find that for the events in our sample, it is not so much the event itself, but the political and economic contexts that most influence impacts. Cities in democracies with more market-led economies experienced fewer adverse impacts and were better able to use the event for urban development than those in less democratic countries with more state-led economies. None of the cities, however, was able to avoid negative impacts.

ID CROSS-NATIONAL RESEARCH; MEASUREMENT INVARIANCE; POSTMATERIALISM SCALE;
   POLITICAL-CULTURE; CONSUMER RESEARCH; DEMOCRACY; MODERNIZATION;
   EQUIVALENCE; ATTITUDES; SOCIETIES
AB This article reports evidence of misspecification of the measurement model for the index of emancipative values, a value construct used as a key explanatory variable in many important contributions to political science. It shows that the scale on which the index is measured is noninvariant across cultural zones and countries in the World Values Survey. In addition, it demonstrates that the current index composition mixes different value dimensions and their actual associations with various political outcomes, in particular the index of effective democracy. However, an analysis using a novel approximate Bayesian approach shows that at least one specific subdimension of emancipative values, known as pro-choice values, truly exists and may be validly measured and compared cross-nationally. The article also contributes to the recent discussion on whether emancipative values are a reflective or a formative construct by providing thought experiments and empirical evidence supporting the former interpretation.

DE Corruption; Political cycles; Russia
ID BUDGET CYCLES; ELECTIONS; COMPETITION; POLICIES; MODELS; PANEL
AB It has been established that opportunistic incumbent politicians, both elected and appointed, adjust public policies in systematic ways over political cycles. We show that the corrupt behavior of appointed politicians also follows certain patterns which are driven by political cycles. Based on BEEPS data, exploiting variation in the dates of surveys and in the starting dates of Russian regional governors' terms of office, we find that corruption levels, as perceived by firms operating in different regions of Russia, are higher closer to the end of a regional governor's term. We argue that such a pattern cannot be explained by standard political budget cycle reasoning, but rather that the observed pattern may be generated by governors' accumulation of private information about their likelihood of remaining in office for another term. When a governor gradually learns that he will not be re-appointed once his current term has expired, he has increasing incentives to engage in corrupt activities in order to accumulate wealth before his departure. Alternatively, when a governor becomes more certain that he will remain in office, he may have higher incentives to smooth rent extraction over time and thus not to increase it. We test this explanation in several ways and consistently find supporting evidence.

DT Article
AB The essay examines the social policy principles underlying state funding schemes that shape the functioning of non-profit organisations in service delivery in Russia. Scrutinising federal and regional financial tools, the analysis reveals that some non-profit organisations are engaged with a neoliberal logic promoting state funding based on competitive grant processes and a means-tested approach to clients, while others seek privileged access to state resources to secure a statist and stratified service provision for their members. The essay argues that neoliberal principles are extended through contracting-out and are undermining statist practices; however, a situation is emerging within competitive outsourcing procedures in which selected organisations are still receiving privileged treatment from the state.

   hybrid regimes; Turkey; Justice and Development Party (AKP)
ID DEMOCRACY; REPRESSION
AB What explains authoritarian reversal and resilience in hybrid regimes? This article derives hypotheses from an in-depth case analysis of Recep Tayyip Erdogan's rule in Turkey. The Turkish case demonstrates that authoritarian reversal can happen as a result of strategies pursued by political elites to stay in power. Ruling elites in hybrid regimes endure by using the strategies of centralization, legitimation, and repression. During the 2002-13 period, Erdogan and the Justice and Development Party (AKP) were able to entrench their power by eliminating veto players within the state, building a well-organized apparatus for targeted repression, and strategically making concessions to large segments of the electorate. Since 2013, they have changed their strategies for political survival in response to emerging economic and security problems and the ensuing defections of some supporters, which had rendered the original equilibrium unsustainable. AKP elites intensified repression, further centralized power, and relied heavily on an ideological and polarizing rhetoric to delegitimize and splinter the opposition. We argue that this new equilibrium of high centralization, ideological legitimation, and widespread repression allowed the elites to withstand serious challenges to their rule, while significantly weakening the competitive and democratic elements of the hybrid regime. Our in-depth analysis of elite strategies and their adaptability to changing exogenous economic and geostrategic conditions in the Turkish context contribute to the analysis of the resilience and vulnerability of hybrid regimes in general and of where on the regime spectrum they eventually move.

AB Our research suggests that the relation between GDP per capita and sociopolitical destabilization is not characterized by a straightforward negative correlation; it rather has an inverted U-shape. The highest risks are typical for the countries with intermediate values of GDP per capita, not the highest or lowest values. Thus, until a certain value of GDP per capita is reached, economic growth predicts an increase in the risks of sociopolitical destabilization. This positive correlation is particularly strong (r = .94, R-2 = .88) and significant for the intensity of antigovernment demonstrations. This correlation can be observed in a very wide interval (up to 20,000 of international 2014 dollars at purchasing power parities [PPPs]). We suggest that it is partially accounted for by the following regularities: (a) GDP growth in authoritarian regimes strengthens the pro-democracy movements, and, consequently, intensifies antigovernment demonstrations; (b) in the GDP per capita interval from the minimum to $20,000, the growth of GDP per capita correlates quite strongly with a declining proportion of authoritarian regimes and a growing proportion of intermediate and democratic regimes; and, finally, (c) GDP growth in the given diapason increases the level of education of the population, which, in turn, leads to a higher intensity of antigovernment demonstrations.

AB Russia is a relatively recent addition to the list of the world's top destination countries for migrants. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia has seen a number of re-configurations of its relationships with the other former USSR republics. These dynamic de- and rebordering processes have been shaped by Russia's policy-making in the field of migration, as well as changes in the character of migration itself, particularly from Central Asia. In this article, we explore the ways in which migrants from Central Asia are impacted by and negotiate this changing situation. The view of Russian society and the state of these migrants primarily as 'homo labor-ans'-working subjects-is not only erroneous, but creates a particular imaginary for policy-making which denies certain migrants the right to family life, often forcing family members and children to become undocumented and denying them access to state support and protection.

AB This article traces the reinterpretation of the Revolution(s) of 1917 in the official historical narrative of post-Soviet Russia. Its construction is an essentially political process, as its discursive hegemony depends on how it fits into the symbolic landscape created by various social actors. The task of reinterpretation of the revolution is complicated by its centrality for two conflicting patterns of memory politics - the critical "working through" the memory of a traumatic and criminal past, and consolidation of the nation/nation-building. There are different coalitions of mnemonic actors behind each of these patterns. The author reveals different strategies of dealing with dilemmas involved in employing these patterns in the 1990s and the 2000s, and argues that until now the Russian imcumbent elites have not succeeded in reframing the Russian Revolution as a great, though tragic, episode of the national past. In the context of the centenary commemorated in 2017, the incumbent elite seem to have come back to the idea of "reconciliation and accord" that was coined by Boris Yeltsin's team in the mid-1990s. However, its integration into the apologetic narrative of "the 1000-year Russian state" totally changes its meaning, as it rejects "working through" the traumatic past.

ID TRUTH
AB The problem of logical paradoxes is considered in the article. In the first half of the 20th century, a hierarchical approach to solving paradoxes was formulated in the works of Bertrand Russell and Alfred Tarski. From the point of view of this approach the main reason for paradoxes is self-reference. Hence, the hierarchical approach completely prohibits self-reference in thinking and language. This is a solution to the paradox problem in the context of the approach. In the second half of the 20th century, the point of view of the hierarchical approach became generally accepted. Many encyclopedic philosophical writings consider the hierarchical approach as a clear and acceptable way of solving the paradox problem. However, in the research literature on logic, epistemology and the philosophy of mathematics in recent decades there appeared works criticising the hierarchical approach in various aspects. In particular, it was asserted that a) the hierarchical approach generates "revenge problems"; b) the hierarchical approach places undesirable limits for the development of mathematical theories and forces to abandon important results in the field of the philosophy of mathematics; c) the hierarchical approach is too radical for, first, some self-referential statements are paradoxical by accident and, second, some self-referential statements are obviously not paradoxical; d) the hierarchical approach does not cover all paradoxes for paradoxes can be formulated without self-reference; e) the hierarchical approach is absurd from a common sense point of view. Nevertheless, these critical studies were sporadic and unsystematic. Separately, they could not destroy the authority of the hierarchical approach to solving the paradox problem. The author of this article aims to accumulate various critical arguments to the hierarchical approach that were expressed in the research literature in order to demonstrate the importance of the whole variety of critical views, to show the vulnerability of the hierarchical approach in various aspects and to call into question the adequacy of this approach to solving the paradox problem.

   ORIENTATION; EASTERN; PEOPLE
AB The current study examines the extent to which religiosity account for ideological orientations in 16 countries from five continents (Australia, Brazil, Chile, Germany, Greece, Finland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, Turkey, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the United States). Results showed that religiosity was consistently related to right and conservative ideologies in all countries, except Australia. This relation held across different religions, and did not vary across participant's demographic conditions (i.e., gender, age, income, and education). After controlling for basic personal values, the contribution of religiosity on ideology was still significant. However, the effect was substantial only in countries where religion has played a prominent role in the public sphere, such as Spain, Poland, Greece, Italy, Slovakia, and Turkey. In the other countries, the unique contribution of religiosity was marginal or small.

AB This article argues that evidence, even when used politically, contributes to high-quality democratic discourse. Research results on the use of evidence in referendum campaigns in Switzerland show that (1) evidence fosters discourse quality and shifts the focus away from politics to policy; (2) evaluations and basic research contribute positively to discourse, but not opinion surveys and statistics; (3) the participation of experts and administrative practitioners in discourse is crucial to make evidence available to the public; and (4) evidence is always used as a part of a narrative and can alter the constructed images used in a story. In conclusion, the implications for practitioners are discussed.

TI A top-down movement with grass-roots effects? Alexei Navalny's electoral
   campaign
SO SOCIAL MOVEMENT STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
DE Russia; political movement; protest; framing; politicization
AB Today's Russia is a hostile environment for genuine political activity, and especially for movements that aim at changing the current power structure. This is due to the factually limited manoeuvre space of oppositional actors who face obstacles in the form of repression, surveillance and restricted access to the public sphere. Moreover, society is largely apolitical, with political activity often considered futile, immoral, or dangerous. In this profile, we portray the electoral campaign of the opposition politician and anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny, who built a popular movement around his bid to participate in the 2018 presidential elections. Although the campaign failed to build up sufficient pressure for Navalny to be granted access to the elections, and despite the strong hierarchy inside his campaign, we argue that it contributed to the politicization of parts of the younger generation in the country's provinces - which may have greater long-term effects than any concrete projects envisioned or controlled by the campaign's strategists.

ID SPECIALIZATION; INSTITUTIONS; VARIETY
AB Less than a decade since its official introduction, smart specialization, which guides the selection of priorities for innovative development, has proven to be a far-reaching academic idea and political instrument. In the European Union, smart specialization is mentioned among the ex ante conditions for receiving subsidies from European structural and investment funds. Its core principles are considered in innovation strategies in Australia, South Korea, and some countries of Latin America. In Russia, smart specialization is also being introduced in the agenda of policymakers.
   The paper seeks to reveal which levels of governance should be involved in the design of a smart specialization strategy and which factors should be the focus of attention when using this approach. The research is based upon an analysis of the innovation strategies of seven Russian regions, conducted with the adapted RIS3 Self-Assessment Wheel.
   The results of the study empirically confirm that most principles of smart specialization are considered, at least formally, in the traditional innovation strategies of Russian regions. At the same time, without common rules for the selection, verification, and synchronization of innovative priorities as well as a single analytical database, organizational support, and expertise, even regions considered strong innovators fail to find their smart specialization.

ID PERFORMANCE; ECONOMICS; SCIENCE
AB Recent economic studies are increasingly focusing on the interdisciplinary agenda. The pioneer works by the Nobel laureates G. Ackerlof, R. Shiller, and well-known economists D. Snower, D. Rodrik, S. Mukand, P. Collier emphasize the role of narratives in economics. Narratives are a valuable source of qualitative data for better understanding and modeling human behavior. Narrative discourse facilitates distribution of ideas, providing a framework for iterative economic interactions. Being widespread, ideas are increasingly perceived as the rules of interactions, providing informal or formal basis for institutions. Distribution of narratives requires a clear form, easily understandable for the masses. Thus, a range of studies appeal to the concept of narrative along with that of meme. Memes enable ideas which influence economic and political processes, to be easily disseminated and replicated. Distribution of narratives, memes and ideas depend on many factors including: their complementarity to embedded social values, culture, and actors' beliefs and perceptions; dynamics of implicit and explicit knowledge dissemination; feedback effects, etc. Both qualitative and quantitative research methods are relevant for research on narratives, ideas and institutions, depending on the specificity of research questions and research objectives. Today narrative analysis provides an effective framework for economic policy research and empirical studies in institutional change.

AB While formally a federation that vests significant powers in the sub-national bodies of government and leaves it for its federal units and municipalities to decide who will govern them by conducting elections, the Russian Federation is effectively a centralized authoritarian state. This paper uses evidence from the September 2017 sub-national elections in Russia to examine the role of formal political institutions in sustaining the country's political regime. The analysis shows that the political domination of the pro-government party over the regional political assemblies is sustained by a complex combination of party regulations and electoral rules. In particular, gubernatorial elections are organized and conducted in a way that ensures the victories of the incumbent governors who are effectively appointed by the president of Russia.

ID GLOBAL DIFFUSION; STATE; PREVENTION; RISK
AB The governance of crime and security has undergone major transformations in recent decades. Several important shifts in the rationale and logic of crime control have led to a growth in regulatory practices and an expansion of regulatory provisions. As a result, the scope of actors who regulate behaviors have widened as have the types of tools to facilitate the governance of crime and security also expanded. We argue that the expansion of the boundaries of crime control is facilitated through a wide variety of criminal justice and non-criminal-justice regulatory tools to tackle both social problems and crime. We suggest that the time has come for criminologists to look beyond criminology's traditional narrow focus on criminal law and the criminal justice apparatus utilized for crime control and engage in the broader discourse of regulation and governance of crime and security.

AB This paper investigates the effect of political regimes on healthcare outcomes with a novel approach. Instead of focusing on cross-country comparisons, like most studies do, we utilize the within-country variation of political regimes across individual regions. We use the case of the Russian Federation, where large sub-national differences exist in both health outcomes and political regimes in different provinces. General differences in sub-national politics in Russia have been subject of investigation of a large literature our paper adds to. The paper shows that the effect of political regimes on health is heterogeneous and depends on the type of health problems more salient for the region. More pluralist and competitive regimes are able to produce better results than the less competitive ones in rich regions, while in poor regions political pluralism and competition have an adverse impact on health.

TI The Influence of the Imperial Policy of Acculturation on the Formation

AB The imperial policy of acculturation pursued the goal of integrating the alien population into the Russian economic and sociocultural space. In the presented research this process is considered on the example of structuring of the power elite from representatives of the feudal-tribal nobility among the Stavropol christened Kalmyks. It manifested itself both in the formation of the military-bureaucratic status of the Kalmyk managers, and in the imposition of standards for a settled way of life.
   The sources for the study were materials from the funds of the Russian State Archive of Ancient Acts (Moscow), the Russian State Military Historical Archive (Moscow), the State Archives of the Orenburg Region (Orenburg). Part of the archival materials used in the article were S.V. Dzhunzhuzovym prepared and provided for publication in the thematic collection "Volga Stavropol Kalmyks...". The information contained in them allowed us to build a canvas of historical events, in the context of the development of which the empire defined and improved the methods of its acculturation impact.
   The situational approach and the historical comparative method used in the course of the research made it possible to show and compare the changes in the legal position of the feudal-serving nobility of baptized Kalmyks, depending on the political strategy used by the government in a certain period.
   In our opinion, the management elite, formed from Christian-dominated owners and zaisangs, was used by the empire as a kind of subordinate mechanism in establishing control and management over ordinary Kalmyks. For a little more than a century of the existence of the Stavropol Kalmyk settlement, the attitude of the government to the representatives of the Kalmyk nobility has undergone drastic changes - from elevation and support to total deprivation of all special rights and privileges.

AB This paper is devoted to a justification of quantum-like models of the process of decision making based on the theory of open quantum systems, i.e. decision making is considered as decoherence. This process is modeled as interaction of a decision maker, Alice, with a mental (information) environment R, surrounding her. Such an interaction generates "dissipation of uncertainty" from Alice's belief-state rho(t) into R, and asymptotic stabilization of rho(t) to a steady belief-state. The latter is treated as the decision state. Mathematically the problem under study is about finding constraints on 72, guaranteeing such stabilization. We found a partial solution of this problem (in the form of sufficient conditions). We present the corresponding decision making analysis for one class of mental environments, the so-called "almost homogeneous environments", with the illustrative examples: (a) behavior of electorate interacting with the mass-media "reservoir"; (b) consumers' persuasion. We also comment on other classes of mental environments. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

DT Article
ID RUSSIA
AB Contrary to the popular narrative of return', the spheres of influence that have destabilized Ukraine are not a throwback to the nineteenth century. They are something new. What makes them new is explained here in a story of a failed experiment to escape geopolitics in a region between the borders of an enlarged European Union (EU) and Russia. This project created a grey zone' of overlapping authority, jurisdiction and allegiance out of which new spheres of influence emerged. Ukraine's geopolitical misfortune was to be included into this grey zone'. The logic of this new narrative of the Ukraine crisis is worked out with reference to the literature on neo-medievalism - a political theory that develops a critique of supranational projects like European integration.

AB By permitting early resignations of the governors of Russia's regions, followed by their participation in premature elections, the federal center seeks to facilitate their long-term political survival. This study uses the data from the 2013-2015 gubernatorial elections in order to reveal the Kremlin's motivations for this strategy. The analysis demonstrates that in contrast to the previous periods of Russia's political development, when the federal center tended to reward the governors for electoral deference, the current strategy is aimed primarily at long-term risk aversion. This signifies a shift in the order of priorities of the Kremlin's policy toward the regions.

DE intercultural and interlingual communication; foreign language;

AB The globalisation processes of the modern world problematise coexistence in a multicultural space. An important role in this situation belongs to the language, regarded as a unique tool for effective interaction between representatives within different linguistic societies. The authors consider intercultural communication as a problem of the new reality in the communication era, which claims the need for an adequate interpretation of the ways of intercultural communication. This article reveals the peculiarities of different types of intercultural interaction and its impact on the success of interpersonal communication, discloses the complex interrelation between the factors of the intercultural communication process and the significant role of language in knowing one's own and "alien" culture. The identification of this specificity facilitates the determination of the linguistic and philosophical foundations with regard to the problem of intercultural communication barriers through a foreign language. "Due to culture" differences lead to the type of communication, in which communicants belonging to various sociocultural communities apply special linguistic and sociocultural knowledge and discursive strategies. The conceptualisation of notions correlated with the research area requires the distinction between "cross-cultural", "intercultural" and "foreign-language intercultural" communication. Consideration of the language as a means of cognising the world allows concluding that the success of intercultural communication is associated with a wide range of special knowledge, skills, abilities and personal qualities necessary to overcome some inevitable barriers in communication. The difference is between intercultural communication at the global and regional levels, when a global or a regional language as lingua franca serves the means of interpersonal interaction. The authors reveal not only the importance of the ability of effective interaction of communicants and their mutual influence, but also the correlation with the success of foreign-language intercultural communication based on the multiplication of competencies designed to adequately interpret the manifestations of sociocultural and linguistic peculiarities. Against the backdrop of the escalating processes of globalisation, a favourable solution to the problem of overcoming intercultural communication barriers in the context of the reorganisation of the education system is the acquisition of a cognitive plurilingual competence that encourages mutual knowledge of linguistic cultures.

AB The article discusses theoretical issues related to the preparation of a legal act regulating relations in the field of strengthening the unity of the multiethnic people of Russia (the Russian nation). The project includes "preservation of Russian society as civil nation" and "strengthening of the all-Russian identity". The article shows that the term "Russian (civil) nation" isn't equivalent to the "Russian (ethnic) nation", as well as why (during adjustment of the Strategy of the State Ethnic Policy until 2025) the formula "multinational people of Russia (political nation)" remains. The results of all-Russian representative surveys of the Institute of Sociology FNISC RAS and public opinion research centers showed that Russian identification does exist in the public consciousness. During the last 25 years, this identification has been growing, and in recent years is shown by 75-84% of Russians. We analyzed the dynamics in hierarchy of macro-identities. The Russian civil identity has become one of the dominating ones, along with the ethnic identity. Author's attention is focused on the semantic content of the Russian identity. In people's perception, Russian identity is based mainly on the common state and territory and has state-civil content. In the mass consciousness, the formation of civil identity is slowed down by low level of trust towards power institutions (except for the President of the Russian Federation), low legitimacy of laws and norms of civil society, low responsibility for affairs in the country (30-50%) and representations of the state as "common home" for all citizens, regardless of ethnicity, race and religion.

AB One might summarize the state of the field of research into contemporary Russian politics as a dismal consensus: most observers believe that durable authoritarianism has consolidated itself, and there is very little chance of democratization in the foreseeable future. However, political regime changes are often launched and developed overtime as side effects of moves made by political actors, and their outcomes are not predetermined. This article aims to go beyond this dismal consensus, and revisits some of the arguments on the role of structure and agency in post-Soviet regime dynamics. Apart from the changes in structural variables, it reconsiders the role of the incentives and choices of self-interested political actors, who are not always omnipotent and well-informed strategists. The overall dismal tendencies nevertheless leave some bias for hope in the analysis of regime dynamics in post-Soviet Eurasia and beyond.

AB The paper discusses the current situation of young people and the experience of implementing the youth policy in the post-Brexit UK on the base of a qualitative analysis of the results of in-depth interviewing of senior officials associated with the implementing of the youth policy at the regional and national levels, the representatives of higher education institutions, and of the public organizations dealing with youth issues. First, the institutional foundations of the youth policy are specified. Further, based on the expert opinion, the characteristics of the current situation of the young people are described: the existence of economic problems such as increased poverty, unemployment, insufficient level of education; aggravated sense of isolation from the common European home, which runs counter to the common European identity; ethnic, social, racial obstacles to successful career development and the growth of hostility towards immigrants. The paper puts forward proposals on the effectiveness of the implementation of the youth policy, on new challenges for young people associated with the country's decision to withdraw from the European Union, the situation of migrants after Brexit, the vulnerability of youth at the intersections of social classes and ethnic identity. The conclusion is drawn on the effectiveness of youth policy that is insufficient in the context of an aggravating economic crisis, the growth of aggression in society. The consequences of the ineffective youth policy in the form of radicalization of youth, absenteeism and other signs of the weakness of the role of youth in the political life of the country are highlighted. The author emphasizes the need for youth policy to develop the political conscience among young people, to ensure intercultural dialogue among the representatives of different ethnic and religious groups residing in the country, to integrate the remaining immigrants into the host society and to create a civic identity among young people in post-Brexit UK.

AB The tasks of modernization and development of education and science are of a key importance for the Russian Federation. Despite a number of significant changes in the Russian system of education and science over the last 10-15 years, the best Russian universities still cannot compete with the world leading universities. In 2013, to change this situation the state started one of its most ambitious projects to increase the international competitiveness of Russian universities, which is the project "5-100". Though the need for such projects for the development of science and education is widely acknowledged, the "5-100" has received contradictory estimates of different stakeholders and experts. By 2017, the project approached its half-time line and spent a significant part of its resources, thus, it is time to consider its interim results. Moreover, the today's close attention to the project determined numerous speculations not only in the media but also in scientific articles aiming to assess the project's impact on the Russian system of education and science based on ideological and political judgments. The authors understand and accept all informed judgments but emphasize the importance of evaluating both reasons for such large-scale projects and factors affecting their implementations. A superficial estimate of the project "5-100" leads to the emphasis on its minor disadvantages, which usually hides its less obvious positive sides. Thus, the article focuses on the role of the project "5-100" in the modernization of the Russian system of education and science, considers its different aspects, and identifies possible approaches to assess its efficiency at the final stages of its implementation (or to develop new projects to increase the international competitiveness of Russian universities).

LA Russian
DT Article
DE centenary of the 1917 Revolution in Russia; commemoration; the
   infrastructure of collective memory; mnemonic actors; political use of
   the past; memory politics; politics of memory; symbolic politics;
   historical narrative
AB The article analyzes practices of public commemoration of the centenary of the February and October revolutions in Russia. It reconstructs the symbolic strategies and historical narratives of the key mnemonic actors - the ruling elite, the Communists, the Russian Orthodox Church, the "Conservatives", the "Liberals" etc. The analysis is based on the recent texts of politicians and public intellectuals from these groups. The research combines an analysis of discourses and commemorative practices. A commemoration of a historical event is considered as the political process, the outcome of which depends on interaction of mnemonic actors who 1) have certain political aims and take particular position against the other actors, 2) selectively use the common repertoire of symbolic resources and take part in its transformation. By the results of analysis, the commemoration of the centenary of the revolution(s) takes part in the context of a fragmented memory regime. This conclusion is based not only on significant discrepancy between the competing narratives, but also on the presence of several mnemonic warriors who use this symbolic chance for promotion of their own political agenda and seek to delegitimize their opponents. According to surveys, the same discrepancy about the revolution is revealed in the public opinion. However, the official project to celebrate "conciliation and concord" of the Reds and the Whites is facilitated by the fact that almost all major mnemonic actors (with exception of the Yabloko Party) share the "patriotic" and anti-Western discourse of the incumbent elite. Besides, the authority has as an influential ally: the Russian Orthodox Church. Nevertheless, in the context of the fragmented memory regime oppositional actors can impede a public demonstration of "conciliation and concord" even without large resources. This suggestion is well supported by the case of local opposition to a construction of the memorial to Conciliation in Crimea, which was designed as a central event of the official commemoration.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE populism; political transformations; fragmentation of political
   landscape; anti-system policy; radicalization of public consciousness
AB The article is devoted to the assessment of the current state of the European populism. Basing on the outcomes of the European electoral cycle in 2017, as well as sociological polls data, the author suggests that, contrary to the opinion of some Western analysts concerning "decline of the populist wave", there is stabilization of the populism's impact on the political life of the continent. The article emphasizes that while in the Western Europe there is a certain stagnation of the "populist offensive" on the political power system, in Eastern and Central Europe there is a completely different situation - stabilization of positions in this system that have already been won by populism. Along with a certain consolidation of electoral niche previously gained by populism in some West European countries one can watch enhancing of populist impact on the European political discourse and the real policy of a number of mainstream parties. The article highlights some evolution trends of populist parties themselves. These include the intensification of contradictions between the desire of populists to win support of radicalized voters, on the one hand, and their striving to win positions in the political power system that requires some mitigation of populists' anti-systemic radicalism, on the other. At the same time, the article provides abundant evidence of recent shifts in the European public mind, which contribute to the enlargement of the electoral base of populism by creating a new socio-psychological situation in European societies, more favorable for the populist forces' activities. The author argues that although the political consequences of these trends are difficult to predict, essential aspects of the current political transformations generated by populism are further fragmentation of a political landscape and corresponding increase of uncertainties in the political life of Europe.

TI LIFE HISTORIES OF THE ETNOS CONCEPT IN EURASIA: AN INTRODUCTION
SO AB IMPERIO-STUDIES OF NEW IMPERIAL HISTORY AND NATIONALISM IN THE
   POST-SOVIET SPACE
LA English
DT Article
ID SOVIET ETHNOGRAPHY
AB The article is an abridged version of the first chapter in the edited volume A Theory for Empire Written on Its Margins. It presents an account of more than 150 years of what the authors identify as "etnos-thinking" - the attempt to use positivistic and rational scientific methodologies to describe, encapsulate, evaluate, and rank "etnoses" across Eurasia. Its central argument is that the work of professional ethnographers created a powerful language parallel to the political vocabulary of "tribes," "nationalities," and "nations." The essay surveys the definitions of etnos offered by scholars during the twentieth century, and argues that historically etnos-thinking emerged and developed in the multidisciplinary scientific environment of "biosocial" science - an approach to identity heavily influenced by physical anthropology and natural sciences. The biosocial synthesis - and etnos-thinking - was incompatible with Soviet Marxism of the 1930s, but had a piecemeal revival in the 1960s. The article claims that etnos-thinking acquired new dynamism in post-Soviet Russia. Although leading academic anthropologists criticize the concept, it remains high on the agenda for many intellectuals and ethnic activists in the twenty-first century.

DT Article
DE protest movement; social theory; communication; society
AB The present paper is a study of the causes and forms of contemporary protest movement. The authors carefully explore the theoretical language employed in the description of protest movement and examine the social functions and dysfunctions of protest, as well as the connection between extra-parliamentary activism and the traditional institutions of modern society. What makes Russian protest so specific as compared to other social movements around the world? One observation clearly stands out: the new types of self-organization are based on modern communication media and technologies, including the social networks whose importance has long been underestimated. It is therefore logical to subject the influence exerted by social media on the development of social movements to particularly stringent analysis before proposing a tentative model of protest movement in terms of communication theory. Further on, the authors raise several questions aiming to determine the substantiality of protest movement: whether it is an 'interactive rhizomatic network' or rather a form of collective action, and, if so, whether such collective action is a product of modified collective consciousness and must therefore be regarded as derivative from the plurality of deviant opinions and beliefs? Another problem which merits close attention is whether protest movement is to be considered a new variety of political conflict, or, to take another perspective, whether it can be understood as a kind of collective creativity or rather a previously unobserved form of emerging new (or old, but undergoing transformation) institutions. Can the protest be interpreted as a manifestation of the so-called 'civil society'? The present authors give a negative answer to these questions; they suggest that the essential and unprecedented characteristic of protest movement is the way it attempts to solve social problems without regard to institutions, organization, politics, or parliamentarism.

ID CHAINS
AB The paper contributes to the growing body of the researches on Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) by adding center-periphery and global value chains (GVCs) dimensions to the concept. Being an essential part of China's program for "great national revival by the 2049" (second of two so called Two Centenaries), BRI is de-facto a complex and wide-range plan that shows how China is going to upgrade its supply chains and develop a full range of core functions inside the world system. This is the first time that such economically large and politically independent state tries to lift itself up from semi-periphery to the core of the world economy. Five main aspects of BRI, namely policy coordination, facility connectivity, unimpeded trade, financial integration and people-to-people bond need to be understood as Chinese attempt to upgrade its position in GVCs. China needs cooperation with peripheral developing countries to fully realize its competitive advantages. Declining productivity of foreign TNC affiliations, emerging alternative channels of investment, active promotion of the free trade agenda, training the pool of foreign workforce and "inclusive globalization" as new ideological concept - all are elements of possible China-driven transformation of the whole world economy. China-led industrialization of developing countries is already changing spatial profile of many industries, and this will become the main factor of new stage of globalization. Whether the course to become successful depends on could Chinese "inclusive globalization" and BRI indeed serve the interest of people of developing nations and fight the global inequalities. This is the only way for China to become a truly core power. In this view, BRI is a longstanding megaproject to dramatically transform the world-system that is currently too closely bound to only one the political leader.

DE world order; world politics; global powers; international system; UN;
   international crises; balance of power; multi-polarity
AB Current world order is in crisis and in process of reshaping. However, mainstream of Western analysts and political-academic community of Russia interpret differently and often alternatively the definition and parameters of the world order, as well as manifestations of its crisis. The author investigates the conceptual framework of describing evolution of international system in terms of changing periods of relative stabilization (order with widely recognized rules) and periods of disorder (transits). The article compares modern Russian and international concepts of world order, periodic sequencing of stable and destabilized stages of international system, analyzes varying definitions and historical periodization of world order. The areas and manifestations of the crisis of the previous model of world order are revealed, as well as directions of undermining strategic stability and erosion of the system of arms control and disarmament. The author poses the question whether the level of general "systematization" of international relations is high enough to perceive the international relations as unified "system with rules", or whether the world remains a set of weakly related regional agglomerations. The article probes alternative hypotheses, whether post-bipolar period since the end of the Cold war is the new format of world order based upon principles of international behavior coordinated between Russia and the West. The author also considers whether the sharpening of international tensions after 2014 manifested the crisis of that format of world order, or international processes of last three decades after the end of the Cold war represent just fluctuations within trajectory of evolution of world order established after the end of the WW2 since mid-20th century until modern times. The author sketches directions of reformation of the world order from the angle of Russian national interests and in view of tendencies of current and prospective evolution of the international system.

On the basis of a series of all-Russian representative surveys it is shown that in the 1990s, despite the state's refusal to fulfill some of its key functions, domination of the norm of the priority of the state interests over human rights (traditional for Russia) still remained due to the inertia of the norms and values system. However, in the late 1990s the process of changes in Russians' attitude to the right of the state to realize its interests at the cost of human rights (and, consequently, its right to legitimize violence against citizens), as well as to the right of individual to have his own interests and to protect them in any way, was initiated. In the 2000s, this process accelerated, and now, for the first time in the recent history of Russia, the norm of the priority of state interests over human rights has lost its dominance. The Russian society is currently split into two polar groups comprising about 20% of population each, while the rest of the population forms the "silent majority" without any clear position on this issue. For Russia, such situation marks the beginning of a "silent revolution," the consequences of which can be enormous, since in neo-etacratic societies the norm of priority of the state interests over human rights lies in the foundation of their "institutional matrix". It is also demonstrated that interest in political rights and democratic freedoms is not a feature of supporters of the human rights priority in Russia; for them, it is primarily about socio-economic rights. Moreover, they, like Russians in general, are largely convinced that the Western way of development is unsuitable for our country.

AB Despite numerous studies on whether democracy reduces the infant mortality rate (IMR), the empirical results remain mixed at best. In this article, I perform several theoretical and empirical exercises that help explain why and under what conditions we should expect politics to matter most for a decrease in IMR. First, I capitalize on the epidemiological view that IMR - the most commonly used indicator of health in social sciences - is better suited to reflect public health micromanagement than overall social development. Second, I theorize that autocrats have incentives to invest in health up to a certain point, which could lead to a reduction in IMR. Third, I introduce an omitted variable - good governance - that trumps the importance of a political regime for IMR: (1) it directly affects public health micromanagement, and (2) many autocrats made inroads in achieving good governance. Finally, for the first time in such research, I use a disaggregated IMR approach to corroborate my hypotheses.

TI Party Reforms and the Unbalancing of the Cleavage Structure in Russian

SO EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB This study analyses the influence of the party reforms of 2012 and the counter-reforms' of 2013-2014 on the Russian party system, and the structure of political and electoral cleavages in Russian regions. The emergence of new political parties in 2012-2013 led to a temporary increase in electoral competition, an augmentation of the political space, and a rise in the number of electoral cleavages, but these developments did not weaken the domination of United Russia. The trend towards an ever greater tightening up of entry requirements for contestation in the elections led to a lowering of the number of political and, consequently, electoral cleavages, in addition to a reconfiguration of the political space. The study shows that there was an unbalancing of the political cleavage structure in 2012-2015: the socioeconomic political cleavage, whose primary place is a key determinant of equilibrium, ceded the top position to the authoritarian-democratic cleavage in 2012-2013, and to the Ukrainian' (systemic) cleavage in 2014-2015.

AB The article is devoted to the analysis of the ratio of opposing linear (armored) forces of the russian 1st Pacific and japanese squadrons during the russian-japanese war of 1904-1905 before the start of hostilities, and the coverage of the tactical and technical characteristics of armored ships and the strategy of their use by the naval leadership.
   There were used as materials the pre-revolutionary, soviet and modern historiography. The published documents as well as materials of personal origin, such as memoirs, memoirs and diaries have also been applied.
   The principles of historiography, scientific objectivity and consistency, which are traditional for russian historiography have made the methodological basis of the research. In the process, the problem-chronological method was used, which allowed to consider the topic of the study in chronological order, paying attention to the issues related to the preparation of the russian Japanese war, as well as the situation in the foreign political arena.
   Also, the paper attempts to assess the chances of winning the 1st Pacific squadron, taking into account its combat capabilities on the eve of the war in terms of the general battle. This article discusses the diplomatic situation before the russian-japanese war and analyzes the strategic plans of the parties for its conduct.

AB Vigorous economic and political activity aimed at increasing an investment attractiveness of the region creates the conditions for attraction of investments proposals to the economy of the Federal subject. Increasing the investment attractiveness of the territories contributes to the additional inflow of capital, to the growth of the regional economy and development of small businesses as a highly dynamic sector that adapts to changes in the external environment. Development of an effective investment policy is impossible without identifying the types of economic activity which are the most attractive for investment. We carried out structural and dynamic analysis of the types of economic activity to identify their most attractive and competitive types. The paper reveals the approach proposed by the authors to determine the types of economic activity that are attractive for investment from the point of view of minimizing the risk of outperformance stability loss. Mathematical, statistical and graphical tools were used to identify the above types of economic activity. A structural and dynamic comparative analysis of the shipping volume for 14 types of economic activity in the Republic of Tatarstan was carried out; localization coefficients have been calculated and risk diagrams have been constructed, taking into account the frequencies of outperformance for a type of economic activity.

AB This article considers the reasons and consequences of the increased attention from politicians and scholars to the challenges of national and global food security. First, the authors focus on the contradictory definitions of food security in intellectual and ideological debates which determine the development of national and global doctrines of food security (and 'food sovereignty' as its critical alternative). Secondly, the authors consider past and present attempts to ensure food security and identify the historical zigzags of food policies in Russia (from the Soviet autarchic policy of food self-sufficiency to attempts to liberalize food security definitions in the 1990s, and the new protectionist and autarchic food security doctrine of the 2000s). The authors also present a range of common indicators of food security, and emphasize that the gross growth in the production of various types of food is insufficient to assess the quality of national food policies. The key indicators of food security include the effectiveness of agricultural production, access to quality food for all social groups, and the potential of consumers to control the issues of national food security. Finally, the authors consider the sociological approach to the study of food security and present data from a series of sociological monitoring developed and conducted by the Center for Agrarian Studies of RANEPA 2015-2017. The analysis identified the 'double autarchy' in the responses of respondents: on the one hand, they support the general political course on food protectionism and nationalism (state autarchy), while, on the other, they strive to implement a micro-policy of autonomous food sovereignty (family autarchy) by intensifying household efforts to ensure natural self-sufficiency.

DE audiovisual media text; film; the USSR; perestroika; school; university;
   student; pupil; teacher; cinema
AB Films of the "perestroika" period (1986-1991) related to school/university theme showed that: - the educational / upbringing process has lost the previous strict storylines and in many respects has lost its communist landmarks;
   - both school and university have acute problem areas (crisis, disappointment and fatigue, professional "burning out" of teachers, stagnation, hypocrisy, lies, bureaucracy and authoritarianism, pragmatic cynicism of students, teenage cruelty, underage sexual activity, etc.); - the activity of a schoolchild / student again became more directed toward the outside world than to the inner world;
   - appropriate distance in the teacher-student relationship has become more fragile (familiarity, sexual relation, or its provocation); in the films Work on Mistakes (1988) and Asthenic Syndrome (1989), male teachers even fight with high school students in class or in the school corridor; - the prestige of the pedagogical profession in the eyes of students and the public has fallen even lower; in accordance with the real state of affairs, female teachers' images (often lonely, unsettled) came to the forefront;
   - the main conflicts of plots were built on the opposition of non-ordinary teachers and students with stagnation, bureaucracy, mediocre bosses / colleagues / peers.
   In fact, one can probably assume that the exposing "black series" of the perestroika cinema (where the youth theme was one of the most prominent ones) served a kind of "mobilizing purpose", only at the time it was not the orientation of "Soviet power elites in the renewal of the tools which they embodied the communist project with". Conversely, a Western-oriented part of the Soviet ruling elite used "uncensored" cinematography as one of the levers for the gradual liquidation of socialism. On the other hand, it is possible not to attach special importance to this "conspiracy" assumption, believing that Soviet cinematographers spontaneously walked in the wake of political and socio-cultural changes of the "perestroika" era. After all, we should not forget that by the end of the 1980s a paradoxical situation arose in the USSR when the state continued to finance film production, but in the actual absence of censorship, filmmakers could produce all that they wanted, practically ignoring the opinion of the leading bodies of the CPSU and the government.

DE meso level of economic analysis; complexity economics; heterodox
   economics; economic orthodoxy; institutional mesoeconomics; increasing
   returns
AB The main goal of the article is to show how such new approaches as Mesoeconomics (ME) and Complexity Economics (CE) in economic analysis meet the challenges facing modern economic science. It is shown that the development of these approaches has been brought about by both practical needs and shifts in the system of paradigmatic scientific knowledge. Also shown are the differences between the initial assumptions of CE and ME, and the set of initial postulates of neoclassical mainstream economics. It is emphasized that CE and ME are based on modern ideas of self-organization of complex systems. At the same time, they restore the traditions of classical Political Economy, since they also consider the organic nature of the economy, evolutionism and historical conditioning. Both approaches explore the logic of the formation of economic mechanisms that create patterns of economic life and the spread of change. Along with the commonality of the approach from the ME perspective and the approach from the point of view of CE, their distinctive characteristics are identified, which allows them to complement each other. Comparison of ME and CE makes it possible to carry out a more in-depth analysis of the methodological features of mesoeconomic analysis, in comparison with the author's earlier works on this subject (Kirdina-Chandler, Maevsky, 2017; Kirdina-Chandler, 2018 - both in Russian).

AB The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA/Comecon) was established in 1949, but active cooperation between socialist countries of Eastern Europe began only in the mid-1950s. The CMEA countries sought to expand intra-bloc trade, especially against the backdrop of the success of Western European integration. The purpose of this research is to identify and analyze the non-market trade links within the CMEA in 1956-1959 as factors for expanding integration between socialist countries. The analysis is based on the materials of the Russian State Archive of Modern History, and the Russian State Archive of Economics. In 1956, accelerated industrialization in Eastern Europe led to the emergence of crisis phenomena in most CMEA countries. The relations between states were tense. The Polish and Hungarian crises of 1956 showed the severity of the situation. The Soviet Union harshly suppressed political opponents. At the same time, Moscow tried to support the economies of the CMEA countries. One of these measures was expanding trade with them. The results of the research showed that there was nonmarket expansion of trade in the case of coal supplies to Poland and Czechoslovakia, imports of Polish coal, exports of Bulgarian tobacco. In 1957-1958, there were serious imbalances in intra-bloc trade. Normalization of trade relations was intended to be achieved through the creation of the Multilateral Clearing System. In 1958-1959, this system was ineffective. This suggests that the CMEA countries used trade relations in the period under review mainly as a political tool.

AB The economic crisis since 2010 has affected Russia's political economy by reducing the income available to fund political loyalty-the key mechanism of neopatrimonialism. Through an investigation of key infrastructure development projects, we examine how this crisis has affected the preparations for the 2018 Football World Cup. In so doing we introduce the concept of crisis neopatrimonialism, referring to the political and economic adaptations of a neopatrimonial system in response to economic crisis. Our research uncovered three major adaptations of neopatrimonialism in the context of World Cup preparations: a retreat of private money and concomitant rise in public funding, a reordering of favored elites, and higher costs of loyalty.

AB The article looks into the most important aspects of the world economy reindustrialization, examines strategies for reindustrialization of the USA, Canada, and Australia. The correlation between the world trend, namely the transition to the digital economy, and the process of reindustrialization within the framework of the Fourth Industrial Revolution is considered. of industrial production of the USA and Canada it is shown that the absolute advantage of Canada when carrying out the re-industrialization of the economy is skilled labor, specialists with secondary education. The study confirms the fact that amid the reindustrialization on the verge of the Fourth industrial revolution, the availability of skilled labor is a necessary condition for the competitiveness of the state. The Russian Federation faces the situation when conducting the re-industrialization is complicated by adverse international economic and political environment (policy of sanctions against Russia). It is revealed that for the Russian Federation the reindustrialization of the economy shall combine the active modernization of the existing production capacity, while shaping new industries on the basis of technologies of the sixth technology wave. The comparative analysis outlined that under the circumstances the drivers of the new industrialization should be science-based industries, with the latest technologies and the largest number of highly skilled personnel concentrating there.

DE genome; genetic code; general theory of text; genome as a hypertext
ID LANGUAGE; BIOSEMIOTICS; GRAMMAR
AB The similarity between language and genetic information transmission processing has been recognized since molecular genetics was founded. Numerous attempts have been made to use linguistics techniques to decipher protein genes. The modest informational impact of various approaches to decoding the "protein language" was predictable: this type of technique is limited by the processes of encoding and at best helps compile a dictionary of units. However, this technique cannot describe a language and identify the semantic and textual structures that are decisive for communication. Thus, the functions of a large amount of non-coding DNA remain unclear. A text (but not a sign) should be regarded as an artefact of the creation, transmission, conservation and transformation of information. A general theory of text should be capable of describing linguistic texts and the process of their structuring, functioning and transformation. It should also be able to represent the biochemical structure of a genome as a hypertext that consists of an ordered subset of other texts. A text can be considered to be a quasi-organism that possesses memory, creative-cognitive characteristics and communicative force, and a cell can be considered as a quasi-intelligence capable of manipulating abstract semiotic entities. Such an approach requires the construction of a new, multimodal, and text-oriented version of semiotics (next-generation semiotics), in which text and context are the basic concepts and signs and meanings are considered to be context-dependent variables and, simultaneously, context-forming operators.

AB This article presents a conceptual history of socialism in two Western borderlands of the Russian Empire-namely, the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Finland. A contrastive comparison is used to examine the birth, dissemination, and breakthrough of the concept from its first appearance until the Revolution of 1905. The concept entered Polish political conversation as a self-applied label among emigres in the 1830s, whereas the opponents of socialism made it famous in Finland in the 1840s in Swedish and in the 1860s in Finnish. When socialism became a mass movement at the turn of the century, socialist parties (re)defined the concept through underground leaflets and brochures in Poland, and through a legal labor press in Finland. In both cases, the Revolution of 1905 meant the final democratization of socialism, attaching more meanings to the concept and making it the most discussed ism of modern politics.

DT Article
DE Weber; Protestantism; "spirit of capitalism"; Germany; economic history;
   industrial revolution; discursive practices
ID CALVINISM
AB This paper is the first of a two-part critical essay on the discursive methods used by great German sociologist Max Weber in his classic study on the relationship between economy and religion "The Protestant Ethics and the Spirit of Capitalism" (1904-1905). The author examines in detail the place of modern (rational) capitalism in Weber's general taxonomy of the various historical forms of economic organization and describes its major differences from alternative types of capitalism, for example, political, booty or robber, and adventure capitalism. Another important issue also discussed in the paper is the relationship between two central Weberian concepts: protestant ethics and the spirit of capitalism. The author shows that Weber's authentic thesis on the genesis of modern capitalism was fatally misinterpreted by almost all of his critics. Special attention is paid to the religious exegetics provided by Weber in his work. A key point in his theological exercises was a notion of "psychological premium" that adherents of ascetic Protestantism obtained if they achieved success in their worldly activities, such as occupational careers or profit-seeking. In their eyes this signaled that they were destined by God to salvation and thus relieved the burden of religious doubts associated with the absolute incomprehensibility of God's plans. In such a way Weber explained how Protestantism might become an engine of modern capitalism. HHowever, Weber's exegetics of religious texts was subject to devastating criticism by Canadian sociologist R. MacKinnon who demonstrated Weber's deep theological illiteracy. Counter-criticism with a defense of the Weberian analytical scheme was provided by American sociologist D. Zaret. Commenting on this discussion, the author concludes that the arguments of Weber's critics are much more convincing since his exegetics of religious texts seem to be at best partially, and at worst totally, incorrect. This implies that the pivotal thesis of "The Protestant Ethics and the Spirit of Capitalism" of Protestantism as a launching pad for modern capitalism is devoid of solid behavioral foundations.

AB The paper examines the role of testosterone-driven aggressive behavior in the politics of non-democratic regimes and, in particular, its influence on the extent of repressiveness of these regimes. To measure testosterone exposure, we apply the facial width-to-height metric (fWHR) - a standard proxy widely used in the psychological literature - and look at a sample of Russian regional governors. We find a positive relationship between the fWHR of the governor and the level of repression in his region. Testosterone-related behavior is, however, more widespread among younger governors and among governors with shorter tenure in office. Thus, the paper contributes to the recent trend of integrating insights of behavioral economics in political economics research.

TI LOOKING FOR A WAY OUT: TRANS-SIBERIAN TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS AT THE
   TURN OF THE 20th CENTURY
SO QUAESTIO ROSSICA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE geographic imagination; transport routes; Trans-Siberian Railway;
   Siberian River Routes; Northern Sea Route
AB Referring to a large number of journalistic works of the turn of the 20th century that reflect the views of different business, political, and social groups, the author analyses the narrative strategies underlying the representation of both implemented and hypothetical Trans-Siberian transportation projects. The article aims to explicate the cultural attitudes and political goals of the authors of the transportation projects which formed their strategies of mental appropriation of territories. The author singles out and analyses three aspects related to the perception of Siberian space: imperial, regional, and transnational. According to the first aspect, Siberian space was regarded as an enormous geopolitical bridge meant to connect the centre of the country with remote Russian territories (the Far East) and Russia's spheres of influence (Manchuria, Northeast China). This approach was implemented when the Great Siberian Railway was built and came to represent a horizontal distribution of power, connecting the imperial centre and the periphery. The regional idea of Siberia was a metaphor of its closedness: this was not induced by its nature but rather by artificial economic reasons. The Russian government favoured the export of Siberian butter but not that of grain. The Great Siberian Railway was thus regarded as a means of improving foreign trade. However, this route for Siberian grain was closed following the introduction of the Chelyabinsk railway tariff in 1896. Under such circumstances, Siberians had to resort to the idea of the 1860s-1870s of organising a transit trade route from Siberia to Europe. At the turn of the 20th century, there appeared two approaches to how this could be fulfilled: by joining the basins of Siberian and Central Russian rivers (Siberian River Routes) or establishing a connection between these rivers by means of the Kara Sea (Northern Sea Route). According to the third - transnational - aspect, all three routes were regarded as elements of global transit routes to be established. Following the 1904-1905 Russo-Japanese War, the Russian authorities considered it a national communication system which was not only of economic but also of military and strategic importance. On the eve of World War I, the idea of the Northern Sea Route as an international route was replaced by the idea of it as a "natural monopoly" of the Russian state.

AB This review focuses on the most remarkable works in contemporary Russian historiography from recent decades on the pre-Petrine seventeenth century. Consciously ignoring the literature dedicated to diplomacy and war because of the sheer size of the available material, the author isolates questions connected with the socio-political and cultural development of the Muscovite state and society. In particular, she examines works looking at the intensity and direction of pre-Petrine Russia's socio-cultural contacts with the West and the Orthodox East and the extent of their influence on the country's historical development. Noting how the exhaustion of Marxist methodology (in its Soviet variant) has led contemporary Russian historiography to revive the opposition of the Slavophiles and Westernisers, the author nevertheless emphasises its new foundations, which are based on different methodological principles. There has been a shift of scholarly interest away from the 'base' to the 'superstructure' (to use the old Soviet terminology): now dominant is the attention placed on the discursive practices of the epoch and on the problems of intellectual history, the history of personhood, the network-actor interactions that created the fabric of social and cultural reality, and the increasing need to study the sources. The article's main conclusion is that the varied (and sometimes mutually exclusive) interpretations of the meaning and significance of the cultural changes in the second half of the seventeenth century can scarcely be reduced to some generalising representation of the epoch. This will require the further accumulation and interpretation of empirical materials in the framework of new research paradigms. It is necessary to understand this period as part of an integral whole with the era of the Petrine reforms.

DT Article
DE nationalism; national identity; political identity; identity politics;

   integration project; European Union; political space; new nationalism
AB The author proposes a new approach to the interpretation of political phenomena traditionally described in both academic and political discourse as "nationalism" and "separatism". "Nationalism" as a concept can provide a research framework for evaluating the factors that provoke ethnic tensions in democracies and stimulate their transformation into open conflicts between the central state and regional authorities in regions possessing a certain level of cultural - economic - political autonomy, but it needs to be updated to take into account the "new nationalism" phenomenon. "New nationalism" has recently taken root in the nation states of "old" Europe in regions with a high level of civic activism and economic and welfare development. Differing nationalist agendas comprise a situational combination of cultural, social and economic factors, which are channeled into political protest. The contestation over identity issues in territorial communities within the nation state are used by political elites to promote preferential tax policies, budget autonomy and an independent social and cultural policy, especially in the use of language and in education. At the core of the political agenda is the "right to decide" and to choose the priorities of community development which is promoted by democratic political agents of diverse political affiliation, predominantly centrist, in coalition with former radical nationalists who have abandoned radical political activities. An overview of regionalist contention in Europe indicates possible future transformations in the organization of political space in democracies where identity issues in hand with consistent development strategies will be the key consolidating factors for political communities involved in the integration processes.

TI Targeting in quantum persuasion problem
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
DE Persuasion; Belief; Updating; Quantum-like; Subjective representation
AB In this paper we investigate the potential for persuasion arising from the quantum indeterminacy of a decision-maker's beliefs, a feature that has been proposed as a formal expression of well-known cognitive limitations. We focus on a situation where an agent called Sender only has few opportunities to influence the decision-maker called Receiver. We do not address the full persuasion problem but restrict attention to a simpler one that we call targeting, i.e. inducing a specific belief state. The analysis is developed within the frame of a n-dimensional Hilbert space model. We find that when the prior is known, Sender can induce a targeted belief with a probability of at least 1/n when using two sequential measurements. This figure climbs to 1/2 when both the target and the belief are known pure states. A main insight from the analysis is that a well-designed strategy of distraction can be used as a first step to confuse Receiver. We thus find that distraction rather than the provision of relevant arguments is an effective means to achieve persuasion. We provide an example from political decision-making. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ID PARADOXES
AB Truthteller sentences (e.g. "This sentence is true") and sentences of the no-no paradox (e.g. "The following sentence is false" and "The previous sentence is false"), in contrast to Liar-like sentences (e.g. "This sentence is false"), have an excess of consistent unique truth values. This circumstance makes it possible to consider such sentences as examples of genuine semantic pathologies. The way to treat them can be found in the anaphoric prosentential theory of truth. This form of non-redundancy deflationism takes the notion of truth not as an ordinary predicate describing a certain real property, but as an anaphoric operator, which makes it possible to meaningfully substitute prosentences with its own antecedents. The anaphoric prosentential theory of truth interprets truthteller sentences and sentences of the no-no paradox as prosentences that lack propositional content. To treat semantic pathologies without imposing the ban on the use of any so-called "groundless" sentences, anaphoric existentialism should be supplemented with metalinguistic analysis. This way will make it possible to show that truthteller sentences and sentences of the no-no paradox actually do not ascribe any unique truth values, but they establish certain types of relations between the semantic content of such prosentences. The use of the words "is true" and "is false" has no purpose to tell us which unique truth values are possessed by these prosentences, but informs that between their possible antecedents there is a certain relation R; the relation determines whether or not these prosentences have the same value. Truthteller sentences can be consistent assumed only "is true"; sentences of the no-no paradox can take in only "is false". Therefore, the metalinguistic analysis of prosententional semantic content can serve as an effective way to eliminate excess of consistent unique truth values for truthteller sentences and sentences of the no-no paradox, and it does not require the ban of any so-called "groundless" sentences.

AB We empirically study how social capital influences individuals' preferences for redistribution to target groups using unique surveys of approximately 34,000 individuals across 68 Russian regions in 2007 and 2011. There is a positive relationship between social capital and support for government redistribution based on objective verifiable criteria. We interpret the results in terms of the perceived likelihood of cheating. Benefits to the 'needy' are at greater risk of being diverted to nondeserving claimants compared to benefits for which there are objective criteria, such as merit, being retired or disabled, or having many children. Our results show that when there is higher social capital in a region, there is also less tolerance for the possibility of cheating by recipients of government income transfers.

AB The paper explores different approaches to assessment of liberal world order and its main political subject - the liberal political establishment (LPE). This issue is looked upon in the context of global governance and regulation and drawing on the notions of post-West, transactional relations, New Populism, dual core West. The author analyses political-ideological competition in the EU, emphasising the role of the LPE moderate wing and of the European alternative. The further growth in the popularity of New Populism in the European Parliament election in May 2019 is foreseen. The author holds that the creation of the EU political-military potential is an imperative. He argues that an active multivector Russian foreign policy pursuing the model of cooperative polycentrism is more conducive to her interests that the concept of "strategic patience".

DT Article
ID LONG-RUN; GROWTH; REFORM; RENTS
AB This article considers Russian income inequality in relation to the trend toward rising inequality in the U.S. and in most parts of the world. Income and wealth inequality in Russia has been rising except in periods when the economy is in recession, and wealth inequality in Russia is now highest in the world. The analysis shows that inequality trends in Russia share some characteristics with other developed and developing economies, including technological change, increased integration in the global economy, and the capitalization of rent streams. Financialization and dependence on natural resource extraction contribute strongly to both cross-sectional and cross-regional inequality in Russia. The absence of institutions for aggregating broad competing social interests whether corporatist or partisan restricts the capacity of the political system to set agreed rules governing the distribution of the burdens and benefits of economic growth. As in other political systems, both democratic and authoritarian, high inequality undermines the state's ability to provide public goods that would contribute both to inclusive economic growth and a growing middle class.

AB In the modern world education plays an important role traditionally acting as an institution of knowledge transfer. At the same time, under the conditions of the multipolar world the role of education has considerably expanded. It is ingrained in the foreign policy arsenal of a number of states, being the integral part and form of their foreign policy strategy.
   The paper deals with the approaches of a number of Russian and foreign political scientists to the problem of qualifying education as one of the tools of the soft power policy. This topic doesn't yet occupy the sufficient place in domestic politological research that is conditioned by the fact that Russia has adopted the concept of soft power as a true instrument of political influence in the international field with some delay.
   Speaking about the geography of the research, it should be noted that western authors take interest in various regions of the world and, first of all, in the most actively developing states such as, for example, China. As for Russian works, in most cases they are devoted either to the analysis of the domestic experience of implementing the policy of soft power with the use of the resource of education, or to the European policy in the context of the participation of the Russian Federation in Bologna Process. All these fact allow for concluding that the problem under consideration demands further studying and conceptualization.

DE religion; Islam; Middle East; radicalism; ISIS; prognosis;
   globalization; politics; migration; secularism; fundamentalism
AB The growing prevalence of religious commitment and the advancement of secularism are the two parallel tendencies, though in confrontation with each other, that underlie the contemporary world development. In many parts of the world, including its Islamic segment, there is an expansion of the "Zone of Disbelief". However, simultaneously, a process of some sort of religious renaissance is underway, which is related to the need of reviewing the routine socio-ecclesiastical values and behavioral stereotypes, likewise the search of a spiritual dimension, so typical of our high-tech reality. One of such tracks invokes an appeal to the traditional religions or a formation of new religious trends. In this context, especially given the exacerbating conditions of other problematic aspects pertinent to the societal development, the most versatile and staggering "discharges" become highly likely. The rampage of right-wing and left-wing extremism is periodically in evidence across the political spectrum in Europe and Latin America. Also, in some parts of the Islamic world, and not only in the Middle East, a powerful impetus is given to religious radicalism, which entails largely dramatic and broad-ranging consequences. Controversial tendencies linked to the religious factor are woven into the not-less-controversial fabric of globalization. While objectively creating the prerequisites for a dialogue of religions, likewise for rapprochement of various denominations within one and the same religious doctrine, at the same time it overshadows their conserving, identifying function. And this forms a part of the resistant reaction of society through revitalization and activation of particularism. The religious world is confronted with the erosion of values and their desecration. A dual process of expansionand-reduction is in place - when the quantity indicators of the area of religiousness can be on the increase, while its quality indicators can be subject to readjustment. Although in certain religious traditions, inner heterogeneity remains a serious factor of tension (the Sunnis-the Shiites), overall, the World of Faith is becoming less rigid - including in connection with the perception of elements belonging to other cultures and customs. Similar tendencies are witnessed in the World of Disbelief. The reasons and prospects for the ongoing upsurge of radicalism in the Middle East should be viewed within the context of more fundamental and longer-term processes underway both regionally and globally. And, by all means, with due account for the vigorous, but contradictory globalization trends, as well as apparently inexhaustible relevance of religious factors for the evolution of society.

AB The last two or three years have become a time of an unprecedented rise of interest to Eurasia. The Russian initiative to create Greater Eurasia, which is seen as the main conceptual framework for promoting various cooperation projects in the region, is often criticized for the lack of concrete content. Given the growing number of regional initiatives including from China and India Russia needs not only to formulate an attractive idea, but also to show its relevance and efficiency.
   Despite the absence of objective historical conditions for its implementation the concept of 'Greater Eurasia' can become a rational practical embodiment of a wide range of development and security priorities for many countries in the region. The problem of the study is the absence of objective prerequisites for the creation of Greater Eurasia while there is a wide range of subjective reasons.
   The article examines the preconditions for the emergence of Greater Eurasia as well as various ways of this concept's perception and political interpretation. For historical reasons projects for the consolidation of Eurasia have largely remained on paper, but the current regional and global trends create relevant conditions for their implementation.
   The study analyzes the content of Eurasian integration and possible formats of cooperation within it. Particular emphasis is made on security issues, economic interaction, and the development of institutions in the Eurasian space. The authors stress the need for reform of the OSCE in order to bring its activities closer to the current geopolitical conditions. The prospects for the development of the SCO and its role in Greater Eurasia are also under consideration.
   Special attention is paid to relations with potential participants of Greater Eurasia project (including European countries) and non-regional actors. Eurasian integration is also analyzed from the European integration perspective. According to authors' estimations, in EAUE there is a need for greater attention to the issue of state sovereignty (similar to the European experience of country representatives and expert groups) and strengthening the institutional capacity of organization.

AB This paper presents an empirical study of the globalizing urban landscape in the post-Soviet region. In order to understand the position of cities in relation to each other in the context of economic globalization, the study considers the transnational city network in the post-Soviet region. At the center of analysis are the locational strategies of global service firms operating in the former Soviet cities. We adapt the interlocking network model proposed by the Globalization and World Cities research (GaWC) network to the regional level to uncover the interurban relations. Unlike the classical studies of the GaWC, this study focuses on the analysis of intraregional spatial patterns of globalization. The research shows that the globalizing regional city system is in the midst of substantial restructuring and that the state of former Soviet Union (FSU) cities in relation to Moscow is altering. The integration of FSU cities into the global economy mostly occurs through capital cities. However, under the current political and economic circumstances, the position of each capital city within the region has become diversified. The analysis indicates that the globalization of cities within a particular region reproduces similar processes on a world scale, which are characterized by spatial concentration and hierarchical relations. However, our research has shown that patterns of urban globalization at the regional level significantly depend on the historical context and national economic and political tendencies, thus creating conditions for the penetration of the world economy into cities.

TI Exploring the Dynamics of Xenophobia in the Nordic Countries
SO CHANGING SOCIETIES & PERSONALITIES
LA English
DT Article
DE xenophobia; tolerance; international migration; ethnic immigrants; the
   Nordic countries; the theory of value change
AB In the last few decades xenophobic and extreme right-wing political movements have become increasingly strong electoral forces in many European countries. The Nordic countries have long been viewed as among the most tolerant countries in the world, with exemplary protection of minorities. Nevertheless, in Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland, xenophobic parties also moved into first place during the past decade. Both national and international laws require governments to protect people against discriminatory treatment, but developing effective policies to cope with discrimination requires a clear understanding of the factors that trigger xenophobia. Despite a substantial body of cross-national research on the subject, the causes continue to be debated. The article reviews the relevant evidence in an effort to move closer to a clear understanding of causes of xenophobia, particularly in reference to the Nordic countries. Social identity theories, group threat theories, theories of nationalism and value theories all provide us with potentially useful cognitive explanations of xenophobia. To explain the perceived increase of xenophobic sentiments requires a dynamic theory of value change. The article draws on all these approaches, concluding that relatively secure people tend to be more tolerant than less secure once. Summing them up, I conclude that existential security/insecurity is the major cause of non-xenophobic/ xenophobic attitudes. To test this hypothesis I utilize the data of the World Value Survey project, which covers all the Nordic countries over fifteen years. First, I compare the results of elections to the National Parliaments with the dynamics of xenophobic and non-xenophobic ( tolerant) attitudes in these countries. Second, I perform a correlation between a society's GDP per capita at various times in the past and attitudes toward ethnic immigrants in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland. Based on the resulting findings, the article concludes that the massive surge of votes for xenophobic parties in the Nordic countries might seem to imply that it reflected an equally massive surge of xenophobic attitudes but this was not the case. Xenophobic attitudes showed the opposite trend. Xenophobic attitudes are more heavily shaped by the levels of insecurity one experience during one's formative years, which occurred several decades before the survey.

AB Who in modern Russia speaks about the what, when, and how of the mutual implications of the sacred and the political? As the article's primary focus, it is shown that almost no-one produces coherent, well-articulated narratives, with the exception of some representatives of higher state authorities (however, not the state as such), the anti-clerical intelligentsia (who have neither political representation nor political influence), and the Islamic community (which concentrates predominantly on their own internal disagreements). The nature of a "powerful" narrative is thoroughly investigated. It is shown that its nature is rather close (although with some reservations) to the phenomenon of "political religion" as in Emilio Gentile's meaning. In the second focus, the reasons of the avoidance of deliberations on the right and wrong interfaces of the sacred and the political of most officials of the Russian Orthodox Church are presented. It is demonstrated that the most likely reasons for this "silence" consists in the inevitable case of the violations of the questioning of the legitimacy of modern Russian state itself. Finally, some scenarios of disruption of the unstable equilibrium that still exist on the dividing line between the Russian sacred and the Russian political are outlined.

DT Article
DE Novgorod the Great; Russian chronicles; Hanseatic documents; political
   identity
AB The aim of the paper is to examine the concept that was crucial for the Novgorod's political identity in the time of independence - 'Novgorod the Great' (Veliky Novgorod). The author takes into account not only mentions of this phrase in Novgorodian medieval documents and narratives, but also considerable and highly important evidence originating from other Russian lands and abroad (Hanseatic and Lithuanian documents written in Middle Low German and Latin). A review of the relevant publications shows that, at present, the issue still remains a controversial one. The author comes to the following conclusions. In Hanseatic documents, written in Middle Low German, 'Novgorod the Great' was already being mentioned since at least 1330s, which is more than sixty years earlier than is considered in the current conventional view. For the first time 'Novgorod the Great' is mentioned not in a Novgorodian text but in a Kievan one - in the account from the Hypatian Chronicle of 1141. In the second half of the 12th century it appeared in the principality of Vladimir-Suzdal, and only much later was adopted by Novgorodians themselves. While in Southern and North-East Rus"Novgorod the Great' was initially used to distinguish Novgorod on the Volkhov River from local and smaller Novgorods (NovgorodSeversky and Nizhny Novgorod), Novgorodians employed it to glorify their polity. In this case it could stand for three different things: the city of Novgorod, the whole polity (Novgorod republic), and 'the political people' of Novgorod, i.e. those of the Novgorodians who enjoyed full citizenship rights.

ID PATRIOTISM
AB Russian society today is characterized by instability of the social and political system and crisis of values system. Surely this situation has affected young people. In these circumstances, young people are close to the identity crisis which can lead to social exclusion. According to sociological empirical research civil identity occupies a leading position among the identity of Russian students. But there is also another trend. Over the past few years the number of students who hold cosmopolitan views significantly increased. Also, there is a tendency of decreasing significance of national and territorial identity. Authors emphasize that students realize that patriotism means not only love of Motherland but work for the good of the country. But only a third of the students can call themselves true patriots. Civic identity has a significant impact on social activity of young people. Students, who consider themselves citizens, are more likely to respect the laws and vote in the elections. The successful national development of Russian society in the future is impossible without active citizenship of young people. This fact determines the necessity of measures of civil-Patriotic education of youth. And the University has a special role in this process.

AB The article presents the results of the study of public commemoration of the centenary of the February and October revolutions in Russia as the episode of politics of memory. It compares historical narratives of the key mnemonic actors - the ruling elite, the Communists, the Russian Orthodox Church, the "Conservatives", the Liberals etc. The analysis is based on the recent texts of politicians and public intellectuals from these groups. The historical narratives are compared by five criteria: 1) the main idea (that usually follows from the mission / political program / identity); 2) the plot (that is usually focused on the story about tragedy and trauma that Russia experienced in the 20th century); 3) the events that come as causally linked elements of the narrative; 4) the main actors; 5) the lessons that should be leant. It is concluded that actually the commemoration of the centenary of the revolution(s) took part in the context of a fragmented memory regime. However, the discrepancy of competing interpretations have not brought an open public conflict because the mnemonic warriors either experienced a lack of resources for more active propaganda, or partly shared the attitudes of the ruling elite. As a result, by avoiding the official commemoration the latter escaped direct public discussions, and could turn the commemorative process to the "peaceful" path.

DT Article
DE philosophy of history; constants; history; literature; society; man;
   power; culture; traditions; innovations
AB The outbreak of interest in the national philosophy of history, which occurred about thirty years ago, can be observed today again. The present author's hypothesis is that such entities as empire, autocracy, power-property phenomenon (where no property is real property), Russian ethnic consciousness (narodnost) and Orthodoxy can be best described as constant patterns of social life that persist throughout the entire history of Russia. Such patterns, on the one hand, are part of the mechanism responsible for organization and functioning of the society; on the other hand, they are mental structures of a kind that impose restrictions or extend the directory of social, economic, socio-political and cultural development, thus contributing to the emergence of the respective social actors and blocking the emergence of actors of a different nature. The dilemma whether the existent set of constant patterns is inalterable, or it can be replaced by another set, is of central importance and has a direct bearing on that special part of the philosophy of history which deals with ideas about the desired future. In clarifying this dilemma an important role, if still underrated by many scholars, belongs to literary philosophy, or philosophizing fiction, without which any philosophy of history will be incomplete. Literature responds to the demands of the history of philosophy in two ways: by its nature it seeks to satisfy the human need for understanding the beautiful and the ugly, the proper, etc., and again through the works composed in the genres of utopia, anti-utopia, dystopia and documentary prose it warns philosophy of history to never allow a recreation of past evil once experienced by man.

DT Article
DE nomenclature; elites; ruling social stratum; soviet heritage;

AB This article provides insight into regeneration of nomenclature as the ruling social stratum of post-Soviet Russia after the revolutionary events of 1990. This type of political establishment is not a state bureaucracy or a meritocratic elite, but a social phenomenon generated and ontologically inherent in the Soviet political regimes.
   The process of regeneration of nomenclature started when the representatives of the Soviet nomenclature filled the structures of the new Russian government. "Privatization in the Russian style" contributed to the process and led to the formation of nomenclature-oligarchic clans. These clans and their struggle for power and resources form the basis of the vital activity of the Russian nomenklatura.
   During the second term of Boris Yeltsin's presidency, the process of "buying up the state" by nomenclature-oligarchic clans and incorporation of their representatives and lobbyists into executive and legislative power structures significantly intensified. Operation "successor," which brought Vladimir Putin to power in 2000, finalized the formation of the nomenklatura-oligarchic regime as the ruling regime in post-Soviet Russia and Russian nomenklatura as the dominant social stratum.

AB For states that have recently declared their independence but remained unrecognized de facto states, building a national identity is critical in the face of international rejection of their political status. Key elements of this new or re-animated national identity are political and cultural icons symbolizing the new political entity but with historical antecedents. Following Anthony Smith's ethno-symbolism approach to the study of nationalism and motivated by Jean Gottmann's research on iconographies in political geography, the article reports the results of nationally representative samples in four post-Soviet de facto states, Nagorno-Karabakh, South Ossetia, Transdniestria, and Abkhazia. Respondents were asked to name up to five political and cultural figures that they admired. The collated results show a great array of local and Russian names in the four republics. Categorizing the names by historical era and by provenance allows a clarification of the extent to which nation building can rely on local heroes. Among the four republics, Nagorno-Karabakh stands out for its ethno-symbolic local character, while Transdniestrian respondents identified few iconic figures. South Ossetia shows a mix of local and Russian names while the respondents in Abkhazia were divided by nationality in their choices.

AB This article discusses factors of political perception of post-Soviet countries on the basis of the recent study. Authors trace the influence of factors that determine images of post-Soviet countries in Russian society. Analysis of empirical data made it possible to identify the relevant objective, subjective, temporal, territorial, communicative, and cultural factors. Results of the study allow to conclude about varying degree of influence of individual factors on the rational and unconscious levels of perception. Object of perception had the most serious impact on the images of neighboring countries. Strong is the influence of political culture that contributes to the perception of post-Soviet countries as "we". Sociodemographic factors differentiate in their influence on the images of post-Soviet countries: education and gender have low influence, while age is quite important. Psychological condition of our own society appeared to be one of the most important factors. In the images of Ukraine and Belarus the influence of mass media is strong, while in the images of Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, a great role is played by the historical and cultural factor and personal experience. The images of all neighboring countries have positive emotional characteristics. This is especially noticeable in those Russian regions that are close to the boundaries and in which respondents have personal experience of communicating with the peoples of these countries.

DT Article

ID REGIMES
AB The article is devoted to the discussion of the hypothetical conditions of the successful activity of the regional governments in the contemporary Russia. Based on the literature analyzing the features of governance under domination of practices of bad governance, as well as considering circumstances and factors of governance at the subnational level, A.Starodubtsev describes the challenges that the regional governments face during the execution of their direct responsibilities. Analyzing the institutional, structural and personal factors that are able to affect the process and results of regional public administration, he studies the possible outcomes of their various combinations. The key thesis of the article is the idea that the combination of a governor's intention upon creating favorable conditions for the development of the regional economy, on the one hand, and ensuring political control over the region, on the other, established positive outcome for long-term socio-economic development. All other combinations of factors are assessed as less favorable. At the same time, in accordance with the basic assumptions of the model proposed by the author intra-elite conflicts create the greatest difficulties for development. Under the Russian political circumstances, intra-elite conflicts are fundamentally non-institutionalized. As a result, political actors do not have well-established channels of interest representation as well as a long-term planning horizon, accountability to voters and other mechanisms, which usually mitigate the consequences of such conflicts. However, the reasons for the lack of stable development in regions with intra-elite conflicts require further analysis. Researchers have yet to learn what exactly impedes economic growth in polycentric systems at the subnational level and how political conflict between different segments of the elite affects the selection of those who govern the respective regions.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE strategic voting; incumbent; opposition; presidential elections;
   parliamentary elections; transfer of electorate
AB The article analyzes the processes of electoral consolidation around incumbents, as well as opposition candidates in the presidential elections in Russia. On the basis of the comparative analysis of the parliamentary and presidential campaigns within 6 electoral cycles, the author reveals shifts in the turnout and voting patterns for candidates in the presidential elections in comparison to the previous State Duma elections. His research shows that almost all viable candidates in presidential elections rely on the electorate of a certain party - usually the one from which the candidate is nominated (the only important exception to this rule is the vote for P.Grudinin in the 2018 elections). The study also shows that the increase in turnout in the presidential elections plays into the hands of the incumbent (except for B.Yeltsin in 1996), although in some cases it can boost support for a strong opposition candidate (e.g., G.Zyuganov in 1996) or an entirely new candidate (e.g., M.Prokhorov in 2012). Having compared voting patterns between parliamentary and presidential elections, the author comes to the conclusion that an incumbent is usually able to court swing voters, and, depending on the political context, voters from various party clusters such as supporters of "A Just Russia", LDPR, liberal parties and the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (the latter - at the level of certain regions). Opposition candidates possess much more limited opportunities or lack them altogether. The author interprets the revealed trends as a manifestation of strategic voting, which is based on a rational choice of voters in favor of an incumbent.

AB The article presents the results of the comprehensive study conducted by the ZIRCON Research Group in four frontier regions of Russia (Crimea, Primorsky krai, Kaliningrad and Murmansk regions) and two control regions located in the Russian geographic core (Kostroma region and Chuvashia). The research methods included collection of data on the current situation in the regions, mass opinion polls and a series of discussion focus groups that included representatives of (1) small and medium-sized businesses, (2) civil society, and (3) expert community. The sample included adult population of these regions at the age of 18 years and above. The sample size was five thousand respondents.
   The study focused on the following components: the rootedness of the population (whether people are potentially ready to move to another region); territorial identity; perception of the region of residence and its population; perception of the characteristics of the inhabitants of the region; the level of trust and the propensity for solidarity; the level of openness; the presence/absence of "defence consciousness"; views on the prospects for the development of the region and its "mission"; the perception of the region as "special" in comparison with other regions of the Russian Federation; the level of political loyalty of the population; the perception of and the attitude to the "federal center"; the attitude to the expansion of the powers of the region.
   The study's ultimate aim was to reveal the link between the territorial identity of the population of the participating regions and their people's perception of the prospects for the development of the region, including its relations with the federal center and other subjects of the Russian Federation.

AB This article focuses on the cross-border practices of communities, i.e. practices which constitute the core of everyday life in the Russian border regions. The study is based on surveys and interviews with experts conducted by the authors in 2000-2010 both in the border regions of Russia and neighboring countries. The article analyzes the opportunities and constraints of living in the border regions, and the motives and determinants of corresponding practices in everyday life. Local residents frequently cross the border in search of specific services (e. g. shopping, entertainment, education, health services) or jobs. The authors show that the socio-economic and socio-cultural differences of neighboring states stimulate the emergence of cross-border practices and that these are differentiated according to the properties of the border areas (such as population density, the nature of local economies, connections to large cities and transport networks). The authors conclude that it is more often the case that cross-border interaction is constrained by the lack of corresponding stimuli than emergent obstacles. They also emphasize the constructive role of cross-border practices in maintaining good neighborly relations even in situations of political difficulties.

DT Article
DE Africa; geostrategic rivalry; African pole of world growth; North
   Africa; Sahel; the Great Red Sea zone; Southern Cone of Africa
AB The article examines Africa's role in formation of a polycentric world order. The extreme danger and obvious undesirability of direct confrontation between "old" and "new" players have augmented geostrategic and military-political significance of the "peripheral" zones of rivalry, including that of Africa. Here, nationalism, separatism and religious extremism act as both catalysts of conflicts and convenient tools for external intervention. In order to preserve the old configuration of the world order and the paradigms of global governance, some "old players" are ready to use such means as bribing corrupt elites, manipulating ethno-confessional contradictions, instigating the forces of international terrorism. At the heart of the contemporary expansion into Africa, there is not only the players' desire to strengthen their positions with regards to supplies and consumption of strategically important resources, but also vying to secure lasting positions and zones of influence as part of the competitive struggle in the world economy by the 2020-2050s. By that time, according to forecasts of the leading "think tanks", the African continent will have turned into the main source of global work power, consumer demand and nature-dependent prerequisites for the development of world economy. The econometric forecast analysis carried out at the Institute for African Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences has shown that in 2020-2025, the curve of the indicator "external players' strategic solicitude/ involvement in the region" rapidly changes the angle and fluency of the rise from "smooth and gentle" to "sharp and steep". At the same time, the importance of subregions on the African continent will increase asynchronously. Today, the focus of old and new players' strategic interests tends towards and beyond the zone of the Southern Mediterranean, i. e. includes not only North Africa, but also the Sahel. In the 2020s, strategic attention will sharply intensify vis-a-vis the "Great Red Sea" zone, partially overlapping with the southern Mediterranean zone. Beginning from the late 2020s, there will be a rapid growth in the importance of the southeastern and southern subregions (Tanzania, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, South Africa and associated territories), known in Western strategic literature as the Southern Cone of Africa. Countrywise, there are three potentially significant regional centers of power in sub-Saharan Africa (Nigeria, South Africa, Ethiopia) and one in North Africa (Egypt). However, notwithstanding the undeniable growth of political weight and influence in the international arena of the four countries mentioned, and despite their severe desire to emerge as a universally recognized sole "leader of Africa", the African pole of the polycentric world is unlikely to be formed around one state. All named candidates for leadership are highly vulnerable to destabilization from within and from outside. A scenario of maturation of a single Pan-African pole as a center of global significance is more likely. In this regard, it is imperative to radically increase the attention of the Russian Federation to the African direction, including political, economic and cultural (especially educational and training) components.

DT Article
DE nation-state; national identity; identity politics; "new nationalism";
   political space; European Union; region; education; history textbooks;
   historical narratives; politics of memory
AB Interpretations of historic events are an important part of the contemporary political discourse in the EU countries. Politics of memory have become a key issue in identity politics in "new" Europe in the process of nation building and are on the rise in "old" Europe where nation-states, regions aspiring for autonomy and supranational structures promote diverse historic narratives. Attempts to bring together and reconcile different interpretations of the past in school textbooks are undertaken on the EU level and sponsored by several member states. The leader here is Germany, a country where politics of memory are an inherent part of the political discourse. A revision of national "big narratives" and attempts to take in positions of various groups of the contemporary multicultural societies is a phenomenon of the 21st century. A persistent need for effective mechanisms to maintain social stability is enhanced by mass discontent over the prospects of the European integration process and by a rise of "new nationalism" in some of the better off regions of "old" Europe. Education plays a key role in the formation of the European memory culture, but a consensus on values needed to promote a shared culture is undermined by the current difficulties of integration processes due to Brexit and to contention over migration regulation. This brings in diverse and sometimes non-compatible priorities of memory politics onto the national agenda (as in the case of Catalonia and Spain), and the "struggle for identity" becomes a key political issue for communities aspiring for more autonomy and independence. Opinion polls, questionnaire surveys, school curricula and expert assessments of textbook contents provide the empirical basis for this study. The author demonstrates how reinterpretations of history and newly constructed images of the past are used to reconsider the governance agenda and to legitimize "new nationalism" in the European public opinion.

DE Global value chains (GVCs); world economy; globalization; Russia; fuel
   and energy complex
AB A new dimension of the globalization process of the 21st century is the spread of global value chains (GVCs), or fragmentation of production. The construction of value chains in the transnational context is shown. The concepts, peculiarities of GVCs, estimation of participation in them of particular countries, including Russia, are considered. Russia's role in GVCs as one of the world's leading energy suppliers is analyzed on the basis of current statistics of leading international databases (WIOD, TiVA). For successful integration of Russia into the GVC, it is necessary to reconsider the priorities of state industrial and economic policy. Taking that into account, one of the main goals should become creating healthy institutional environment and developing the strategy of supporting national companies in the strategic economic spheres (especially in manufacturing). While adjusting the state economic policy it's important not only to create new competitive advantages, but also to maintain the existing ones. Russian Federation plays a significant role in the GVCs as one of the world's main natural resources suppliers, with high revenues of the energy companies involved. It's important to broaden Russian companies' activity in the GVCs not only in the lower parts (resources), but also to move upward the GVC by taking part in the upper levels (R&D, marketing, etc.). Russian energy policy in the last few years noticeably changed. The existing GVCs with the EU companies have been created decades ago, main Russian energy companies are important part of European GVC's. But now, due to political situation, such cooperation is considered to be mostly vulnerability, and not as solemnly benefit. Moreover, such situation coincides with the existing great demand for the energy resources from the countries of the Asian-Pacific region, especially China. Therefore, Russian "Turn to the East", which was initially a geopolitical move, has gained a strong economic dimension now.

AB The emigration movement among Soviet Jews is usually dated to the 1960s-1990s. This essay focuses on the premovement emigration in the 1950s, which prepared the ground for the massive departure of Jews and non-Jewish members of their families, primarily to Israel and the United States. The parameters for leaving the Soviet Union in the 1950s were in many ways similar to the parameters for returning to Poland in the immediate post-World War II years. On paper, the basic pools of emigrants were the same: Jews who at the outbreak of World War II were Polish nationals. In reality, many repatriates of the 1950s were more Soviet than Polish, leaving the country where they had lived for up to twenty years, which often was a lion's share of their lives. Those-that is, the majority-who ultimately reached Israel went through two repatriation processes: first, as returnees to their pre-World War II homeland and, second, as Jews going back to their historical homeland. As this essay shows, the contemporaneous political and social climates in the Soviet Union and Poland, the nature of those countries' mutual relations and of their relations with Israel, not present on the map until 1948, framed a unique context for emigration in the early post-Stalinist period.

AB The modern civilization, known as Industry 4.0., is in the midst of a new industrial revolution. It is characterised by the pervasive implementation of convergent technologies, the shift in forms of ownership, fusion of cyber-physical and social realities, endowment of machines with elements of intellect and utilisation of social media in new communication alternatives. Such major social shifts will inevitably instigate a search for new methods of interaction between people and machines in all spheres, including economy, education, industry and everyday life. Gaining awareness of technological, economic and socio-anthropological risks is the primary subject of this paper. The authors analyse various social transformation scenarios, which are fraught with tectonic shifts in the modern society: disappearance of the middle class and unqualified workers, decreasing migration of unskilled workers to Western countries and their self-isolation, and increasing potential migration of the middle class to developing countries. The paper conducts an Umwelt-analysis of both man-machine system development prospects and the danger of the technological singularity, when machines endowed with artificial intelligence may create an economic and political situation that would threaten human strategic domineering and the very existence of humankind. The authors ponder alternative paths for the evolution of humanity through supporting international consolidating megaprojects, establishing network civil society structures, building an economy of trust, releasing mankind's creative potential and spiritual values in the context of decreased industrial employment spurred on by the deployment of the digital economy, which will require a radical change in the aims and methods of education.

AB The article provides a conceptual analysis of approaches to the concept of smart technology through the correlation of smart technologies with other types of technologies (digital technologies, information technologies, convergent technologies, etc.). A conclusion is made about the status of smart technologies in relation to other technologies, analogous to the categorical level of world perception in philosophy in relation to other concepts. The complexity of the choice of the grounds for a more precise definition of smart technologies is noted. It is substantiated that the feature of smart technologies is their ability to perform the functions of the subject. It is proved that, due to the variety and uncertainty of these functions of the subject, it is dangerous to rely on smart technologies in their "smart" impact without an adequate training of a society using such technologies.

AB After neglecting Latin America for over a decade, Russia has recently displayed pronounced interest in expanding its presence in the region. This article aims to examine Russia's contemporary foreign policy towards Latin America and to define whether Moscow's new strategy is a continuation of the former Soviet presence in the region or whether Russia has introduced some new elements. After identifying the motives behind Moscow's renewed interest, the authors analyse the issue with a focus on diplomatic, economic and military activities. The article concludes that despite the tangible progress, there are still many limitations, including conceptual ones. Moreover, Moscow faces keen political and economic competition in the region, from actors old - such as the United States - and new - such as China.

DE Russell; Ramsey; paradox; logic; mathematics; semantics; set; statement;
   self-reference
AB The problem of logical paradoxes is considered in the article. At the beginning of the 20th century, the problem was presented by Bertrand Russell and Frank Ramsey. Russell thought of all paradoxes as similar to each other. Ramsey asserted that they made up two completely different groups. In the second half of the 20th century, Ramsey's point of view was dominant. Graham Priest, a modern Australian logician, affirms that Russell was right and Ramsey was wrong for all paradoxes have a similar structure and one way of solution. The author of the article asserts that in this discussion one cannot decide on the winner because paradoxes are similar in one relation and different in another. All paradoxes are similar concerning the structure and the way to solve them. Russell was right in this relation. However, all paradoxes are different concerning the foundation they are built on, and Ramsey was right in this relation. Paradoxes have different foundations because difficulties in some of them arise in relation to logical and mathematical concepts, but difficulties in other paradoxes arise in relation to the clarification of meanings of linguistic expressions in which concepts of thought are presented. For example, Russell's paradox can be included in the first group of paradoxes because of the problem with the concept of the set of all sets. The Burali-Forti paradox can also be included in this group because of the problem with the concept of the set of all ordinal numbers. Other paradoxes have some problems with either words that express concepts or statements that express propositions. That is way these paradoxes should be included in the second group of paradoxes. The Liar paradox is one of the most characteristic examples in this case. In this paradox, we have a problem with an utterance of a citizen of Crete. Alfred Tarski emphasised the linguistic character of the paradox. In the formulation of the paradox, Tarski spoke about sentences of language. Sentences are more distinct linguistic essences than utterances.

DT Article
DE Greater Middle East; Arab nationalism; Islamism; megatrends; regional
   sub-system; exclusivism; integration
AB The article reviews the milestone political transformations in the Middle East over the span of the "Long 20th Century" - from the end of World War I until the Arab Awakening in the present century. Primary importance was attributed to the state-building efforts (six types of which are identified) and the formation of political systems, largely occurring under the influence of external impulses as well as by means of the "adaptation" of modules exported from elsewhere, but made suitable by the exposure to the powerful prevalence of regional specificity. This resulted, on the one hand, in the creation of hybrid political structures with a fusion of modern and traditional elements, and, on the other hand, in the emergence of multiple institutional disproportions. Eventually, therefore, it gave rise to the continued internal conflict. Debates focusing on the national issue have revealed four principal approaches - pan-Arabic, sub-regional, focused upon nation-state building and targeting to convert the idea of Ummah (a religious Islamic community) into the idea of the nation; none of the above has prevailed, however, the latter (Islamic) is considered to reflect the identity of the region to the biggest extent (although the nation-building process, apparently, has not been completed). In the context of international relations, a key regional mega-trend of the 20th century is the formation of the Middle East as a distinctly coherent political region (despite its inherent heterogeneous elements). A characteristic feature of this system is a high degree of dependence on the external factors and its exclusivity (building up a unity on the basis of juxtaposition of all states versus a common "foe", who is regarded to be an outcast - traditionally it has been Israel, now it is also Iran). The high risk of intra-regional conflict arising out of the significant number of flagrant political collisions is exacerbated by the economic disintegration, growing natural resources shortage (primarily in relation to the fresh water) and the demographic dynamics. As far as ideology is concerned, both Marxism and Arab nationalism seem to become the "dying breed", while Islamism has turned into a powerful driving force. It has been kept on the rise through a great number of movements - that demonstrate a varying extent of radicalism, treat democracy, liberal rights and liberties in a diverse manner, and allow for different stances on the use of violence in political strife, but are mostly prone to display a negative attitude towards the West. Oddly enough, the latter category can embrace Russia as well.

ID MUSCOVITE POLITICAL FOLKWAYS; CULTURE; HISTORY
AB The author of this review engages in controversy not only with the book by J. Arch Getty, but also with the representatives of this trend in historiography, both western and eastern. Undoubtedly, there are a number of archaic traditions in the Soviet Union and contemporary Russia as far as their political, economic and cultural foundations are concerned, especially in comparison with the Western countries. Without some definition and studying of these traditions one could not understand a peculiarity of the Russian political system. Here the author of the review agrees with the book. But it is important to define what archaic tradition is and what we are studying. J. Arch Getty and some specialists in Political Science try to find those traditions in so called 'political practices'. They affirm that such traditions are as old as the hills. It is this approach that causes disagreement. In the reviewer's opinion, nothing changes in the Russian history but the 'political practice', which really can be transformed. Having said that, we must show what this 'nothing' is. Although the Russian history is indivisible, it consists of some epochs which are different from one another. What hasn't undergone changes is the state-serfdom Russian order which took shape in the middle of the 17th century and exists nowadays. In his review the author criticizes some cliche of Political Science. Such magic clues for Russian history as 'patrimonialism' and the 'patron-client relations' cause doubts. As far as the former is concerned, it is so vague that can be applicable to anything. For this reason it is not very harmful to the study of Russia. But one can't say so about the latter. Being adopted by History from Anthropology, this theory has been very popular among some Russian and foreign historians. The author once more stresses the significance of anthropological data and their role in the historical research. But some anthropological data taken from their historical and cultural context may have a detrimental impact on scholarship. The author does not want to accuse Getty because he is a talented and diligent scholar, and his great desire to understand contemporary Russian history evokes only sympathy. But we have to take into account the historical approach, in other words, historicism, otherwise we can distort the historical perspective.

AB This article continues to examine the issue of 'escapees' raised by L. Siegelbaum and L. P. Moch in their work Escaping in Twentieth-century Russia. In the author's opinion, during most of the 20th century the Russian state reacted most strongly to violations of the political regime, often preferring not to notice economic migration. This was due to the carefully concealed inability of the authorities to control the population totally. Violations of the regime of territorial movement by individual migrants were possible due to the uncoordinated actions of central and local authorities. With the gradual liberalisation of the Soviet system in the second half of the twentieth century, migrants were increasingly able to move legally. Refusing to coercively regulate migratory flows led to the displacement of the political factor in migrations by the economic one, which in turn caused a narrowing of 'autocratic' space.

TI THE OCTOBER REVOLUTION OF 1917 AND ITS AFTERMATH IN THE PUBLIC
   PERCEPTION OF MODERN RUSSIANS (EXPERIENCE IN SOCIOLOGICAL MEASURING)
SO SOTSIOLOGICHESKIE ISSLEDOVANIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE revolution; socialism; USSR; post-memory; historical lessons; family

AB The article analyzes historical memory of our society and level of actualization of the 1917 events in the Russian mass consciousness. Authors note a gradual shift in the once actual historical events to periphery of public attention against the background of new challenges and threats facing the country. A century of historical distance also entails reduction of public confrontation on this issue and promotes a more balanced view of complex and contradictory processes of national history. Yet, there remain concerns regarding possible revolutionary upheavals recurrence. One of the important features of our time, so the authors, is actualization of the interest of Russians not only for the past Russian and Soviet state, but also for their families life stories. The surge of interest for Russian history of the XX century in the context of family history is largely due to the rupture of the "living memory" during the previous decades. Today, according to the study, 50 to 60% of Russians do not know anything about their ancestors in the context of historic events of the twentieth century.
   In general, Russians retain a positive attitude to the Soviet era, except for its revolutionary periods. Anti-socialist revolution of the late twentieth century is worth rejection more than a socialist one of the early century. With regard to ideological and political discourse of the Great October revolution and, above all, its revolutionary pathos, much sympathy among the modern generations of Russians it does not enjoy. Among the main historical lessons of the past century the leading position, in the opinion of our fellow citizens, is following: "Russia should live your life and go own way", "the Reform of society must begin with Economics, not with politics", "you can not change the life by the method of revolution." The authors emphasize that the Russians' critical attitude to the revolutionary transformation of society is not the same as their orientation to the stagnation. Russians are today afraid of change and radical breaks of habitual foundations of life, after which the country and its citizens do recover for years, if not decades. Simultaneously, there is a growing understanding that without a serious reassessment of the strategies and priorities that dominated in recent relatively prosperous decade, Russia will hardly be able to move forward.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE Russian identity; national and ethnic identity; civil identity;
   integration; new national social reality; national-civil identity;
   identity policy
AB The authors consider the concept of Russian identity and review some key social and philosophical approaches to the definitions of identity focusing on the contemporary Russian sociological interpretations of the structure and content of national identity. The authors acknowledge the complexity and multidimensional nature of national identity, and believe that it develops in history and proves a certain level of national consciousness. The article considers the today's Russians' self-identification under the macro-social processes in the Russian society in the crisis period of 2014-2016. Based on the results of the national sociological monitoring surveys conducted by the Institute of Sociology of the Russian Academy of Sciences the authors identify the Russians' priorities in the sphere of inter-ethnic and confessional relations in the form of sociological diagnostics. The data of the sociological surveys prove that the identity issues are still among the key problems of the Russian society considering the resources for national consolidation as determined by the status of the Russian identity and by its structure as depending on the stability of civil and ethnic components combination. Today, Russia has to preserve and to renew its self-identification, to construct the Russian national-civil identity as a synthesis of ethnic and civil components. Thus, the state has to develop the so-called "identity policy" as one of the most important ways to strengthen its key political decisions and legislation and to support the spiritual-psychological climate of the society.

AB The article looks at the United Kingdom's and Spain's politics and examines opportunities and limits in utilizing post-imperial identity resources in order to increase the former empires' soft power. Comparing the countries' contemporary experiences allows to identify characteristics relevant for Russia, which is reassessing its historical experience and declares its special interests in the former Russian Empire space in the emerging new world order. The authors analyze largely similar resources, institutional mechanisms and main instruments used by the UK and Spain in their soft power politics: language, education, arts and culture, international development assistance, and the projects aimed at reconfiguring the former colonial territories in the new historical context. The article also looks at the political elites' and wider audiences' perceptions regarding the cultural and ideological basis, economic interests and security considerations connected to the soft power politics, primarily in the former colonies. The major post-imperial soft power resources are language and culture, but it is economic potential, effectiveness of the social and economic models, stability of democratic institutions and a prominent role in foreign affairs that plays the defining role in increasing the attractiveness of former empires and other countries.

   Belarus
AB The article is devoted to the study of evolution of public perceptions of new Russia's borders through the analysis of their representation in Russian printed media. "Nezavisimaya Gazeta" was chosen as a focus newspaper. The study is based on a database of publications collected through screening of this edition in four periods: 1994-1995, 2000-2003, 2008-2012 and 2013-2014. The newspapers "Sovetskaya Rossiya", "Zavtra" and "Novaya Gazeta" were used as the sources of additional information. The authors discovered that modernized East-West dilemma serves as a framework of these representations. Russia faces a fundamental choice between two vectors. The Western (European) vector means the rapprochement with the EU and NATO, adoption of their values and development models. The Eastern (Eurasian) one implies total or partial reintegration of post-Soviet space and creation of new autonomous center of power within upcoming multipolar world. Debates about the future of newly formed borders and the whole post-Soviet space, about building relations with former union republics on the one hand and the EU and NATO on the other, about aims and composition of regional integration projects etc. has invariably focused on the analysis of this dilemma. Since the 1990s there have been changes not only with the balance between two vectors within the media political discourse (non-contradicted in early 1990s they turned in the middle of 2010s into opposite sides of a dichotomy while the eastern vector appeared to be a dominant one) but also with their proper understanding. This article concerns with the Eastern part of two-faced discourse that reflects the transformation of Eurasian integration from the process of mutual attraction of Russia and other post-Soviet republics after a long period of coexistence as parts of a single state to one of the basic forms of global war between East-Russian and collective West. The issue of identity, state building and "battles of memories" which influence the perception of post-Soviet borders are considered in the same context. The final section assesses the possibility of usage of semantical approach to the analysis of meanings (words and senses) forming political language.

AB Twenty-five years have passed since the collapse of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), which led to the disruption of the regional check-and-balance system aimed at resolving national issues and political and socioeconomic contradictions. It also resulted in a number of armed conflicts, including those in the Chechen Republic, Nagorno-Karabakh, Transnistria, Tajikistan, Abkhazia, South Ossetia and later in the South-East of Ukraine.
   Immediately following the collapse of the USSR, key international actors paid special attention to the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) region while trying to secure own interests. This led to the further stratification of the CIS region. A "geopolitical pluralism" started to form there, marked by the fragmentation of nation-state sovereignty over the territory.
   The concept and policy of "geopolitical pluralism" as developed by Zbigniew Brzezinski meets the interests of the United States by making the CIS region more manageable, while at the same time making it more difficult for Russia to implement its own strategic tasks there. The key goal of Russia is the creation of an integrated economic and political union able to take a rightful place in the world. Only the development of deep and comprehensive integration with the CIS states can ensure the competitiveness of Russia's position in the world as well as the positions of its partners in the former Soviet space.
   The purpose of this article is to assess the level of geopolitical pluralism in the CIS space taking account of the membership of the CIS countries in international organizations and their voting on UN General Assembly resolutions. The study is based on the interconnection of quantitative and qualitative methods of analysis of international relations and world politics.
   During the past quarter century Allowing the collapse of the Soviet Union, a regional system of international relations has formed in its place. Despite the fact that the CIS is a kind of linking element which unites most of the former Soviet republics, a certain competition between the new states has become the characteristic feature of the political relations in the region.
   The policy of the west (primarily the United States) became a kind of a branched, diversified strategy aimed at the phased development, transformation and fragmentation of the region. The diversity of foreign policy priorities among the CIS states and the presence of many actors in the region makes mutual understanding and good-neighbourliness between these countries difficult to achieve. To the contrary, this diversity seriously complicates and slows down the development of deep and comprehensive integration, making it more unstable and ineffective.

ID REGIONALISM; SECURITY
AB The article deals with perspectives for integration within Central Asian region. The existing experience of integration in the region is perceived as an important factor. Currently the discourse of regional integration is gaining ground in Central Asia. It can be seen by the updates in the foreign policy concepts of most of the post-Soviet Central Asian countries. Another driver of the issue is the growing international activity of Uzbekistan which is due to the new President of the republic elected in 2016. The article defines the context of regional development, challenges which the region face, specific traits of political process. The rationale for integration is linked to economic problems which cannot be solved by each Central Asian country on its own. Construction of any transport and logistical infrastructure in the region as well as tackling security threats determine regional cooperation. Although the researchers give arguments for advantages of integration in the region, Central Asian leaders are still looking for more efficient format of interregional cooperation. This process is not linear with its ups and downs. The article reveals the institutional experience that Central Asia gained over 1990s in search for its own integration project. Today this experience can be treated as an important step to maturity of national governance in the region. But the reason why there is no implementation of integration initiatives discussed in the region earlier is that the current Central Asian political elites are not favorable to any kind of cooperation that will lead in the future to the formation of supranational bodies in the region. They perceive it as a threat to a stable national development. Another factor is a higher commitment of Central Asian countries to cooperate with non-regional economies rather than within the region. In such context a strategy of "bandwagoning" (as it describes S. Walt) will hamper any regional integration project.

TI RUSSIAN LIBERALS AND THE CONCEPTUAL FOUNDATIONS OF RUSSIAN FOREIGN
   POLICY IN THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY
SO REVOLUTIONARY RUSSIA
LA English
DT Article
AB The article deals with the topic of how Russian liberal parties of the early twentieth century - the Party of the Constitutional Democrats (the Kadets), the Octobrist Party (the Octobrists) and the Progressive Party (the Progressives) - interpreted the range of issues associated with the foreign policy of the Russian Empire, such as imperialism, militarism, colonial policy, nationalism and pacifism. The authors hypothesize that the above-mentioned Russian liberal parties, despite all the differences in their political, economic and social views, adhered to the same foreign-policy approach which could be referred to as liberal imperialism. In particular, all three parties called on the Russian government to prepare for the intensive economic competition for new markets and trade flows, as well as for a potentially possible imperialist war between great European powers. According to the Kadets', Octobrists' and Progressives' concepts, Russia's foreign policy should be highly proactive and imperialistic, and should be based on a strong military presence both in Europe and in Asia.

AB The Albanian factor of the Balkan policy, which received its first institutional design in the late 19th century-"Prizrenskaya League", is currently a serious destructor of the situation in the Western Balkans (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Macedonia, Serbia, Montenegro and partially recognized Kosovo).
   On the basis of historical, demographic, cultural, religious and political facts the article explores the nature of Albanian irredentism and provides a substantiation of the possibility of implementing the scenario of "Albanization", the development of which can proceed in two directions. In the first case the question is of creating a pan-Albanian (con) federative polity under the provisional name of "Great Albania" in the territories of Albania, Kosovo, western Macedonia (Republic of Ilirida), south-eastern Montenegro (Malesia) and north-western Greece (Chameria). In the second case the question is of the unification of the territories of Albanian residence through the association of Islamic provinces of the countries of the region. Special role in the implementation of the scenario is played by the structures of international terrorism which regard Kosovo as one of the central training zones for militants. Substantiation of the probability of the development and implementation of the scenario is given in four key parameters, including political, economic, military and cultural and religious spheres.
   Among the main actors of the scenario the author singles out the armed forces of Kosovo, Albanian paramilitary formations on the territory of western Macedonia, transnational corporations, private military companies, as well as the United States, Britain, Turkey and the Arab monarchies who support the project politically and financially.
   The article concludes that there is a need for an objective political assessment of the situation in the region, an analysis of security threats and risks of another round of destabilization of the Western Balkans. It has not only scientific but also practical implications for the formation of the Russian foreign policy agenda.

AB Modern social and political as well as economic conditions create educational environment that is characterized by a high degree of professional dynamics, political instability and unpredictable future. It makes young people feel to use many approaches to explore the reality. This is the reason to explore the educational technologies in the era of "clip thinking".
   Introduction:
   In the 21st century, the era of technologies and globalization, the ways of perception and processing the information have changed dramatically. Nowadays a 3-year old child knows more about surfing in the Internet than his or her 30-year old parents. Children and adolescents got used to searching for any information they need in the Internet, moreover since the pace of life has speeded up they want to obtain the information as soon as possible. All the above mentioned has led to the formation of the so called "clip thinking", the way of thinking that to the contrast with linear thinking allows to process huge amounts of information quickly, appeals to the emotions and not to the rational part of our conscious but does not allow to make long-term analytical conclusions. So nowadays to educate students efficiently we need to take into account this change and apply new educational technologies that allow us to use the advantages of the clip thinking and to develop the skill of analytical or linear thinking.
   The extend of a problem:
   If to compare clip and linear thinking we can find out advantaged and disadvantages in both of them. For example, clip thinking allows to process information and make decisions quickly, it appeals to emotional and pragmatic part of our mind and helps us to navigate in the world oversaturated with different sorts of information. On the other hand, only with the help of linear thinking it is possible to make analytical conclusions, build theoretical constructions and as a result to get knowledge. Therefore, modern education has to take into account, first, the peculiarities of youth's thinking and second, the need to work out the skill of analysis necessary for development of a fully-fledged professional.
   Research methods:
   Analysis of specialized literature on methodology of the era of "clip thinking" helps to single out a number of approaches and principles to study the educational technologies. Based on a target orientation of "clip thinking" we have distinguished the following approaches: logical - evolutionary, system - dynamic, project (project-oriented) and a personality approach.
   Research results:
   Educational technologies based on the acceptance of clip thinking and necessity to develop linear thinking should include:
   1 Usage of information technologies in the educational process: children should have an opportunity to work with different volumes of information structured in different ways and should make the conclusions themselves based on the research they have made.
   2 The teacher has to appeal to practice and practical tasks, has to show how this or that piece of knowledge can be applied in real life and profession.
   3 As approaches to the study of educational technologies in the era of "clip thinking" we have identified Logical-evolutionary and the Personal Approach.
   4 The teacher has to provide the students with difficult tasks that require deep analyses of the problem and provide the opportunity for independent conclusions made by the students themselves.

DE ideology; institutions; politics; shadow ideology; diffuse model;

AB Ideology is seen not only as a system of ideas, but also as a system of institutions reinforced by new communication technologies (from preaching to machine brainwashing). Deideologization of the 1990s is replaced by the reconstruction of a quasi-ideocracy, in which ideas are secondary and dependent on the political conjuncture. The fatigue of society from the dominance of Soviet ideology gives rise to the following effects: 1) ideological 'idiosyncrasy; 2) "shadow ideology" - an analogue of the shadow economy (the state as an ideological partisan); 3) "latent" ideology the ideological unconscious, acting als ob, "as if' the subjects were carriers of explicit ideologies. Representations of the parallel existence of ideology along with politics, science, culture, economics, etc. are supplemented by a diffuse model of "included" ideology (for example, with a distinction of positions: "science and ideology" and "ideology in science"). According to the scheme of the political constitution of Karl Schmitt, the concept of ideology is based on axial oppositions "faith knowledge", "goals-values", "interests-principles". In this single continuum, belonging to the poles of philosophy or ideology is determined not by content itself, but by intention-directedness or reflexive criticism of "evidence", or by rigid dogmatization.

DT Article
DE sociocultural sphere; threats; state; society; personality;
   psychological state of society; identity; westernization
AB The problem of the socio-cultural threats in contemporary Russia is actualized today by many factors that are related both to objective socio-political processes and to subjective reactions to them by citizens. The multidimensionality of the socio-cultural sphere determines the complexity of this problem and its solution. The approach, discussed in this article, is aimed to identify the sources of threats, their contents and the objects to which they are directed. The latter are state, society and personality. The source of threats in the social sphere are structural dysfunctions of the society: social splits, inequality, identity crisis, structural imbalance in professional, ethnic and other social groups. Threats to the socium can also be caused by psychological dysfunctions: anxiety, anomie, lack of solidarity, unsatisfied security demand for social justice, a state of uncertainty and the absence of long-term prospects. The main characteristic of the cultural and spiritual sphere today is the multiculturalism that has emerged as a result of globalization, westernization, massification, technologization, etc., and is characterized by the mixture of different cultures. This has obvious positive consequences in the form of enriching the culture and building of the global trends. However, this creates problems too: a threat to national traditions in culture as the base of steady political development. The development of the identified problems in the socio-cultural sphere in the future can have both negative consequences for the Russian state and society, and lead to positive changes.

DT Article
AB Dagestan is inhabited by numerous ethnic communities with their own languages, cultures and histories. However, despite its ethnic and cultural diversity, the republic's authorities have consistently sought to promote a unified concept of Dagestani identity. This policy has been challenged by local ethnic nationalists concerned about the future of their ethnic communities, which they saw as being endangered by assimilation and marginalisation. This struggle to secure political and social benefits began in the Soviet period and reached its height in the early 1990s. Resentment was particularly widespread among the Kumyks and Lezgins. Their dissatisfaction with the status quo resulted in a competition between inclusive (national) and exclusive (ethnic) approaches, which in turn manifested themselves in debates over historiography. This essay analyses the development and outcomes of this struggle from the 1950s through to the early 2000s, with an emphasis on the early 1990s.

AB This article considers the relations between the Russian Empire and its national peripheries. The authors focus on the deformation of imperial principles of the organisation of power under the influence of the periphery instead of the traditional analysis of imperial methods of incorporating it. The work is based on documents from federal archives and published historical evidence and is structured around three main problems of the Romanov Empire, i. e. first, geography as a hard struggle with distances; second, politics as administrative practice; and third, economy as the price of the peripheries. The article defines the fundamental principle of Russian autocracy regarding the periphery as its desire for political and cultural integration of the periphery into the state. At the same time, the implementation of this principle forced the imperial authorities to seek other mechanisms to integrate outlying territories. The authors conclude that the experience of the Russian Empire demonstrates an inconsistency between state theory and practice. The periphery was not only an object of imperial policy, but also an agent in the development of the empire itself.

The article shows the objective narrowing of premises and restricting characteristics of the policy of Nordic neutralism, the different aspects of modernization of military-political course of Sweden and Finland at present. The author theoretically and politically examines a hard dilemma: the growth of the present level of conflict in Europe revives the viability of the Nordic model of neutralism in the circumstances close to the conditions of the cold war period: the decrease of the confrontation between the West and Russia may lead to the final erosion, cessation of the policy of Nordic neutralism in the near future. The military-strategical choice of Russia's Nordic neighbors in the Baltic region in favor of NATO, violation of the recognized "red line", can lead to an unpredictable "Baltic crisis", which may resemble the Cuban crisis.

ID YABLOS PARADOX
AB The Russell-Tarski hierarchical approach regards self-reference as a unified source of the emergence for a broad family of various semantic paradoxes. The Russell-Tarski hierarchical approach became the object of numerous critical attacks after the appearance of infinite forms of paradoxes without self-reference at the end of the 20th century. The "Infinite Liar" proposed by the American logician Stephen Yablo, in particular, is usually seen as the most powerful and convincing counterargument against the Russell-Tarski hierarchical approach. The "Infinite Liar" does not contain self-reference. Each of the sentences of this infinite sequence does not speak of itself, but always only of all the following sentences, and the logical construction of this paradox is obviously isomorphic to the hierarchical structure as such. However, the truth-values of individual sentences in the "Infinite Liar" are based on recursive functions. The "Infinite Liar" by Yablo provides analytical possibilities for constructing the original computational semantics that excludes any kind of recursion in determining the truth-value, and it demonstrates effectiveness of the basic principles of the Russell-Tarski hierarchical approach in the struggle against new forms of semantic paradoxes. The "Infinite Liar" sentences are transformed into a modified computational algorithm for the Post machine. The analysis shows that for any initial state of the tape and the starting position of the cell marking mechanism, the "Infinite Liar" algorithm is quite feasible for the Post machine. The absence of a Post machine nonresultative stop in performing the "Infinite Liar" is explained by the fact that the computational algorithm of such a program has the form of a monotonous hierarchical structure in which every arbitrary sentence S' n of an infinite sequence fixes the meaning of strictly following sentences Sn+1, Sn+2, . . ., Sn+m, which completely excludes any form of recursive definitions. The disappearance of monotony in the hierarchical structure of the so-called "Dietary Infinite Liar" almost instantly leads to a nonresultative stop of the Post machine at any initial state of the tape and the starting position of the cell marking mechanism. The difference in performing demonstrated by the Post machine when executing the programs of the "Infinite Liar" and the "Dietary Infinite Liar" is a clear evidence of the effectiveness of the basic principles of the Russell-Tarski hierarchical approach in the struggle against new forms of semantic paradoxes. That is why the ban of sentences (or their sequences) with self-reference remains the most popular of standard ways in the struggle against semantic paradoxes.

AB The article is based on the idea that in the setting of multiculturalism of the Russian society, the escalation of ethnic conflict is fraught with grave risks to the territorial integrity of the state; therefore, there is much tension around the issue of ensuring the spiritual security of the Russian society as a key factor in preserving the national sovereignty and cultural identity of the Russian Federation. The analysis of ethnocultural education as a social institution and sociocultural space of the socialization of an individual has made it possible to suggest that it has the potential to ensure the spiritual security of the Russian society, particularly in regard to interethnic relations. The authors conclude that the continuity of traditions, the interaction of ethnocultures, their sustainability and renewal in the dynamic changes of modern society is comprehended through ethnocultural education, which allows preserving the heritage of local cultures within the context of the nationhood of the Russian Federation. Hence, ethnocultural education serves as a factor of the spiritual security of the Russian multicultural society, ensuring the continuity of reproduction of historical traditions of long-term cohabitation and cooperation of various ethnic cultures in the common cultural and political space of the Russian Federation, having a beneficial effect on the harmonization of interethnic relations and paving the way for the sustainable development of the Russian society.

AB Introduction. For over two decades, Russian education has been in a state of permanent reform. Due to the long and unproductive nature of the modernisation process, researchers are paying special attention to systemic factors, noting that system optimisation processes are structured primarily around organisational and technological models derived from industry. The prevalence of the technological component over the axiological results in the consolidation of a pragmatic, narrowly functional, technocratic vector of education development. To overcome this situation and to break this deadlock, a profound reconsideration of the values underlying mechanisms of reform is required, taking into account multifaceted personal, social, national and universal relations, as well as unity of content, forms and means of education.
   The aims of the research were identified as follows: to analyse the current trends of modernisation in comprehensive schools and higher educational estab- lishments; to justify humanistic mechanisms for improving the modernisation in the context of language education, which performs personally developing and socialising functions under ideological pluralism and opposition of value systems.
   Methodology and research methods. The research was conducted taking a person-activity-based approach, referring to cultural-historical concepts, ideas of philosophical hermeneutics and traditional principles of pedagogical methodology. The theoretical framework was based on the publications and philosophical foundations of Russian and foreign scholars, who define the key role of humanistic principles and value orientations in education. The following standard research methods were used: comparison, induction, deduction, abstraction, synthesis, specification, structural and logical modelling, content analysis of documents and scientific publications on the stated problem, observation, questioning, peer review and experiment. In addition, non-standard methods and research techniques such as metaphorical modelling, biographical method and interpretational techniques were used.
   Results and scientific novelty. Modernisation processes in Russian education were considered: regulatory base, purposes, priorities, problems and prospects. The following thesis was proposed: at the new stage of socio-historical transformation, it is necessary to overcome the negative effects of long-term practice in the reform of the national educational system through developing established traditions as well as updating the humanistic potential of education and ensuring its axiological enrichment. The authors consider pedagogical hermeneutics as a potentially productive means and methodological tool. Pedagogical hermeneutics implies a heuristic and poly-variable apperception of reality through education in order to understand and interpret different genres of cultural texts, providing simultaneous support both to the general public and to the individual, on the basis of rational and emotionally intelligent experience accumulated in science, religion, art, language and national traditions - i.e. culture as a whole. It was shown that language education based on principles of pedagogical hermeneutics is capable of establishing humanistic mechanisms of personactivity-based social norms and cultural models. The authors presented a number of modelling options for the realisation of the proposed hermeneutical approach: various experimentally-validated techniques, educational approaches and procedures designed by teacher-researchers were briefly described, focusing on the achievement of qualitative conformance of educational results to the humanistic appeals and urgent needs of society.
   Practical significance. The use of hermeneutical techniques as educational tools and procedures allows us to decode semiotic information of curricula subjects; in addition, when using meta-language, it is possible to expand the content by adding personal value-sense and dialogical subjectivity, as well as to transform it into a personal sign-symbol or behavioural template. The acquisition of language experience in the process of humanistic-centred education increases the immunity of a student to various manifestations of character defectivity, strengthening identity and resistance to manipulation of consciousness in political and ideological processes and mass media. Moreover, language experience resists the deformation of the communicative sphere and verbal-cognitive processes, encouraging personal self-realisation.

DT Article
ID PENSION REFORM; CONTRACT LAW; WELFARE-STATE; INSTITUTIONS
AB Historical institutionalism has demonstrated the value of close analysis of policymaking to illuminate the relationship between institutional change and policy outcomes. This article emphasises the importance of the institutional setting in which state agencies in an authoritarian regime shape the agenda for choice, resolve disagreements and implement decisions. It outlines a model of policymaking and policy implementation in the sphere of labour relations in China by examining these three issue areas: enforcement of labour contract legislation, technical and vocational education and training (TVET) and pension reform. In all three, policymaking reflects the interaction of state entities, with minimal participation by non-state actors. However, in China, more than in other post-communist countries, political authority is dispersed across state bodies with overlapping responsibilities and levels of the administrative hierarchy. As a result, new policy initiatives tend to be "layered" on top of older ones rather than displacing them, and implementation tends to be hampered by jurisdictional competition and diverging bureaucratic policy preferences. This pattern helps account for the pattern of incremental change and weak implementation.

AB The article provides a comprehensive assessment of the current state and problems of political and legal development of the society, examines the main research positions, theoretical and methodological approaches to modeling the state-legal development of the society in the context of ensuring socio-cultural integrity and sustainable civilization development. Separately, the work analyzes the structure of political integrity and the multilevel process of socio-cultural development of political and legal institutions of the society, the specifics of which are determined by the basic scenarios of political and legal thinking, the interaction mode between the individual, the society and the state, the form-forming tendencies in the institutional-power organization of the society. The authors argue that the civilizational strategy of research and formation of doctrinal and program provisions determining the vector of social development shall be aimed at the reconstruction and interpretation of public power institutions as stable and successively reproduced civilizational phenomena in a certain socio-cultural environment.

AB Domestic and foreign policy of US President Donald Trump is bound up to the solution of the proclaimed goal of "Make America Great Again". One of its main priorities is the fight against the deficit of foreign trade. Being the largest trade partner of America, the European Union faced the unprecedented pressure of Washington, with its threats to impose high tariffs on European goods and demands to eliminate "unfair", in its opinion, barriers to the American export to Europe. This struggle does not take into account either the sad American experience of high import tariffs, which led to the global depression of 1929, or attempts to limit import of Japanese cars in the 1970s-1980s, which led to the deep crisis of the American automobile industry. The trade war also negatively affected political relations between the US and its allies, including not only the EU, but also NATO.

AB The article is devoted to the problem of gender asymmetry in the educational and scientific milieu. Throughout the past century, the sign of gender (gender sign) significantly influenced the development of educational and scientific institutions in Russia. The ratio of the number of men and women varied and, in accordance with it, the "weight" of teachers and scientists varied as well depending on the specific socioeconomic and political conditions, while the gender asymmetry in the educational field remained unchanged. This kind of asymmetry in Russian education is a phenomenon of long-standing. Gender asymmetry has not only aqualitative, but also a quantitative characteristic. The quantitative characteristic is the ratio of the proportion of women and men in higher education institutions - has repeatedly changed in a historical con text. Before the First World War, there were 70 universities and other higher educational institutions with 80 thousand students in the Russian Empire. Gender. asymmetry is not an accidental, but a constantly acting factor in the system of science and higher education, which is determined by objective causes. Among them are the features of the socio-economic system and political regime, the level of democratic development of the country, the needs for material production and the spiritual life of society, the specific features of the demographic structure and legal status of women, the level and quality of life of the people. Objective conditions change - the asymmetry acquires new quantitative characteristics, content and forms.

   People's Party; "Ciudadanos"; Spanish Socialist Workers' Party
AB The nationalist movement in Catalonia with its centuries-old history has never gone beyond demanding the expansion of the region's rights within the Spanish state. In times of the crisis, the situation changed fundamentally: the nationalist sentiments and practices developed into a strong and steadfast separatism movement. Referring to the current legislation, Spanish authorities denied the Catalan government the right to hold a referendum on independence, which it insisted on. That resulted in the legal deadlock and the most acute political crisis in the relations between the sides. After the Catalan authorities unilaterally proclaimed the independence in October 2017, Madrid introduced direct control over the autonomous region dissolving the local parliament and government. The Catalan experience points at the extreme difficulty, if not impossibility, for the part of the state to secede by means of a referendum without an agreement between the ruling regional elite and the central government, without support of the majority of the region's population and without recognition by the international community. The three points above are missing in the case of Catalan separatism. It is apparently impossible to solve or soften the Catalan crisis only by restrictive and repressive measures. The maintenance of the policy of bans and the refusal to negotiate with independence supporters may pose a risk that the Catalan conflict in its acute phase will become chronic in character, and will be perceived as unresolvable. This will result in growth of alienation, emotional enmity between Catalonia and the rest of Spain, as well as weakening of stability in the European Union. It is significant for further relations between Madrid and Barcelona to recognize the Catalan peculiarity in both financial-economic and political-cultural senses, which is inseparable from the reformation of the Spanish legislation, starting with the 1978 Constitution. Meanwhile, the country is missing broad intraparty and societal consensus necessary for solving this difficult problem. Different opinions are clashing over the question of changing the Spanish territorial model. At the same time, even the alleviation of the problem will not be able to fully solve it. There is no such solution which would satisfy the overwhelming majority of the region's population. The Catalan problem will continue to be "in-built destabilizer", Spain's chronic "malaise" it has to live with.

AB The article is written within the framework of the project "Formation of social consciousness and spiritual & moral culture of students in the system of continuous pedagogical education on the basis of the patriotic idea "Mangilik El". There is an imposition through the media, including the Internet, on the territory of Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Belarus, etc. Western, supposedly "universal" values with an emphasis on liberalism and the free market. Only the rights and freedoms of the individual, without emphasis on the laws of community living in society, are put at the center of this work. It divides, individualizes society, provokes in the youth environment of excessive competition. The article presents the results of the study self-positioning of student youth. Young people's perception of themselves and their expectations of others portray an image of a person living in a state of heightened anxiety and a highly actualized need for security, material well-being and recognition focused on himself/herself and private life, ready for action and responsibility in the distance of his/her inner circle. The key components of his ideas about success in life: family and children, financial well-being, business work (55-60%) emerge from this self-attitude. Complement the normative model of success self-realization and the possibility of self-manifestation, education, health, beauty, sports (35-40%). The second plan - the criteria of success associated with the outside world (to be useful to society and people - 18%, recognition and respect from others, finding important contacts and connections, access to information and communication in social networks - 12-15%, politics and participation in political and public organizations - 1%). The model of success in life of young people today is largely confined to the man himself.

AB Powerful political destabilization processes in recent years (such as Arab Spring) have brought attention to unemployment as a possibly important factor in political destabilization. However, the results of different studies, devoted to exploring the relationship between unemployment and instability, are highly contradictory with respect to the direction, strength, and significance of the detected correlations, especially in high income economies. This article examines the impact of unemployment on political destabilization in non-post-Communist (Western) and post-Communist (Eastern) Europe. We use the World Bank data on annual unemployment rates in 45 European countries, numerical values of instability indicators from the CNTS database from 1991-2014, and a modified version of linear regression analysis for this research. The results indicate a strong positive correlation between unemployment rate and socio-political destabilization indicators in non-post-Communist countries and a weak negative correlation in post-Communist ones. Moreover, we do not find a single positive statistically significant correlation of the unemployment rate with any of the indicators of socio-political destabilization for post-Communist countries. We see the main reason for different reactions to unemployment in the differences in the amounts, timing, and conditions for social payments. The larger the sizes of benefits and periods of payments (Western Europe), the higher the protest moods and the participation in anti-government actions. The smaller the benefits (Eastern Europe), the lower the participation in protest activities. Additional factors are constituted by the labor migration from the East to the West in Europe, which washes out "combustible material" from the East, but provokes protest activities in favor of anti-immigrant laws in the West, the "Olson-Huntington effect," and "the patience and understanding" factor of the 1990s.

AB This paper examines the foreign policy of the Galician-Volhynian prince Roman Mstislavich. Roman became the main military ally of the Byzantine Empire in the early 13th century. Byzantium was going through a severe political crisis caused by the Serbian and the Bulgarian uprisings and by the crushing raids of the Cumans. According to Niketas Choniates, the nomads' aggression could have been stopped only thanks to the aid of the Galician prince Roman. The circumstances and the time of Roman's campaign in Choniates' account are the same as in the Russian chronicles reporting the steppe campaigns of the Galician-Volhynian prince.

AB This article discusses perspectives for making global sociology, which implies open and fruitful cooperation between sociologists from different locations, as well as enhancing our discipline's positions in the field of social sciences and in extra-academic environments. Drawing on Wacquant's ideas, we understand neoliberalism as a globally dominant approach to social regulation, combining market-oriented mechanisms in economic transactions and restrictive control apparatus based on the cultural imperative of individual responsibility, supported by the state. Intellectually rooted in European liberal tradition and supported by neoclassical economics' conceptual frameworks, neoliberalism has shaped three interrelated challenges for global sociology: (1) Eurocentric conceptual apparatus within the discipline, (2) domination of economics over sociology in the field of social sciences, and (3) marketisation of the academic world, promoting direct profitability', and making public value' of scientific knowledge less relevant. We argue that these three challenges generate a tendency towards negative ideological unity across a significant number of sociological communities worldwide, which tend to see neoliberalism as a multifaceted common enemy. Despite being evidence-based, this emerging global ideological unity in sociology is problematic because it lacks a strong positive project. Instead of hostile attitudes towards internal and external agents affiliated with neoliberalism, the solidarity-oriented strategies may be helpful in building a truly global sociology.

AB The conflicts between host communities and re-settlers from global or post-Soviet 'South' and public discussions on such conflicts have become a vivid feature of today's public spheres in both Europe and Russia. Discussions in social media may put pressure upon immigration policing, as they reflect both consensual and conflictual public moods. Thus, it is crucial to know who (including actors and institutions) social media users see as the culprits in this conflict and who is expected to resolve these problems. We look at four Twitter discussions on the conflicts involving re-settlers in Russia and Germany of 2013-16 and assess whether the user type correlates with blaming and responsibility patterns. We also describe the discursive strategies of blaming in the two countries. The methods of data collection and analysis include vocabulary-based web crawling, expert evaluation of user types, manual coding of tweets, and descriptive statistics. Our results suggest that, contrary to expectations, the blaming patterns are similar: the main blame is put on regional authorities and police, federal government and national leaders, and immigrant groups. While blaming them, people expect the resolution of the conflicts from the federal government, who is seen to be responsible for immigration policies. Also, while in Germany we detect fierce mutual blaming by pro-nationalist and feminist groups partly compensated by neutral media discourse, in the world of Russian Twitter, we see a one-sided blaming of authorities and immigrants in the absence of institutional mediation of the discussion, as well as low expectations of non-violent political resolutions of inter-ethnic tensions.

The aspects of transformations under the conditions of existing "information symmetry" are reviewed.

   The scenario prognosis of the society of the future, variants of its form of rule, political regimes and systems are presented. The author places the emphasis on the danger of loss of subjectivity and the importance of defense of the values of freedom and justice, real convergence of social development and free market economy.
   Considering the fact that the transition to the trans-industrial stage is expected to come with an unprecedented social crisis (huge unemployment rate, horrendous inequality, catastrophic changes of the people's way of life etc.), public association (collective intelligence), discussion and prevention of negative scenarios, social control over the implementation of innovations and technologies seem to be a suitable way to solve highly complex problems.

AB The paper is focused on the first anniversary of the Revolution on November 7 as political events and as specific political time. The representation of the idea of world revolution played an significant role in the early Soviet festivals. The euphoric atmosphere of the October celebrations, which sought to develop the festival organizers, was used by various forces for the replication of ideas about the new era in world history. Celebratory propaganda played an important role in the formation of an image of the power in particular, the images of Soviet leaders how the leaders of the world revolution. Available database sources (primarily news stories, minutes of meetings of authorities, visual materials, resolutions, poems) suggests that these texts were full of religious metaphors and allusions. The Bolsheviks, who feel themselves politicians that change the course of world history, saw the occasion as a special sacred time. Quasi-religious political language was been used for legitimization of power and sacralization of Civil war.

AB Amid the extensive literature on the Stalinist dictatorship during the 1930s and the postwar period, the gap in scholarship on the Soviet leadership during the war years is particularly noticeable. This article fills that gap. Stalin's war cabinet is characterised according to several criteria: first, the formal status of members of the leadership; second, the system of delegating authority; third, the functioning and competency of the structure of collective leadership; and fourth, Stalin's loyalty to his top associates and the degree of their political immunity. The article demonstrates that the war years saw a relative normalisation' of the dictatorship. These important changes influenced the subsequent development of the Stalinist system of power and the evolution of Soviet authoritarianism after the dictator's death.

AB Using a case study approach, the authors review the relationship between Russian symbolic politics and public opinion in the context of the 100th anniversary of the Russian revolution. Public opinion polls and other sources demonstrate that this anniversary was not perceived as an important event by the majority of Russians. The main political actors - the authorities and their opponents - did not exploit the anniversary for their own goals. The authors argue that this lack of interest in exploiting the revolution in political rhetoric could be due to an anti-revolution consensus, i.e. a situation in which most Russians openly oppose a revolution as a possible future scenario for their country, even though they differ widely in how they evaluate the revolution of 1917. Apart from politicians, this also had a great impact on other actors such as writers, film directors, and social movement activists. The authors conclude that the anti-revolutionary consensus constrains the repertoire of protest activities by limiting the use of the Russian revolutionary political tradition.

DT Article
DE globalization; international trade; capital flows; transnational
   corporations
AB The new economic nationalism is on the march in Europe and America. It argues that globalization has benefited the elites and penalized the ordinary workers, so governments should favor domestic producers and restrict global flows of people, goods and capital. The latest proposal came from the President Trump in March 2017 - a thread to ignore World Trade Organization rules and impose tariffs on countries with "unfair" trade practice. The experts suggest that the world may have entered into a new phase of post-WWII economy and a phase of new globalization. The next era could see globalization in retreat for the first time since 1945. The British vote to leave the European Union is a watershed event. It marks the end of an era of globalization driven by deregulation and the giving power over trade and regulation to the international institutions like the EU and the World Trade Organization. Outsourcing and growing trade with low-wage countries, including East Europe, as well as China, India and other countries with large low-wage labor forces have put downward pressure on wages. The message that leaders in the United Kingdom, Europe, and indeed the United States took away from Brexit is that the time has come to stop promoting austerity and business-as-usual trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership and to instead get serious about rebuilding manufacturing and an economy that works for everyone. The political challenge in many countries is to develop a " responsible nationalism", the policy that privilege local interests and local people over more cosmopolitan concerns. In the United States, such policies begin with plans to rebuild manufacturing and create more good jobs. Brexit is a moment of crisis for the global economy, one which demands a fundamental re-examination of contemporary core values. It is time to develop alternatives to the current model of globalization, which benefits only those who are most well-off in the modern society.

DE Exposition Internationale of 1937; Soviet Pavilion; cultural diplomacy;

AB This article focuses on the Soviet Pavilion at the 1937 Exposition Internationale in Paris. The author reconstructs Soviet preparation and participation for this event in the context of Stalin's cultural diplomacy, which helps model the interactions between the authorities and the architectural community during the prewar period. The article considers several key aspects of the state's ideological, political, and artistic guidelines for the Pavilion: the decision-making mechanism behind participation, the choice of architectural design and projects for the decoration of the Pavilion, and criteria for selecting the winners. Additionally, the author shows the decisive role of the government, the Politburo, and Stalin in making all the decisions; she also discloses the mechanism for distributing 'victories' outside the complete competitive procedures. When analysing the architectural and artistic imagery of the Pavilion, the article focuses on multiple historical and cultural contexts. Primarily, the architecture of the Pavilion correlated with the plans for the Palace of the Soviets. In addition, the author studies the correlation of the style of 1930s Soviet architecture with international architectural trends. This multi-dimensional examination allows the author to come to a conclusion about the origins and characteristics of the Soviet style used for 'export purposes' and the practice of artistic appropriation typical of socialist realism. Special attention is paid to 'Stalin's architect' B. Iofan, whose creative biography sheds light on the relationship between the totalitarian state and an artist reduced to the status of a public servant. Me Soviet Pavilion at the Exposition Internationale was a reflection of the USSR: it was meant to demonstrate that the country's involvement in global processes had autarkic content. In other words, it was a demonstration of a Soviet model of the world, one based on self-sufficiency, totalitarian leadership, and victorious ideas.

TI SUB-ETHNIC DIFFERENTIATIONS OF RUSSIAN ETHNIC GROUPS: THE CASE OF
   KALMYKS AND TUVANS
SO NOVYE ISSLEDOVANIYA TUVY-NEW RESEARCH OF TUVA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE ethnicities in Russia; sub-ethnic groups; sub-ethnic differentiations;
   sub-ethnic identity; Kalmyks; Tuvans; Kalmykia; Tuva; archaization; clan
   structure
AB The article examines the issue of the differential processes and events in the ethnosocial lives of Russia's regions. These processes and events, stemming from the complexity of indigenous populations, can be termed 'sub-ethnic differentations', which, in their turn, can appear in declarative or non-declarative forms. In this article, the authors focus on sub-ethnic differentiations within the contemporary Kalmyk and Tuvan ethnicities.
   A quick glance at the ethnogenesis of both Kalmyks and Tuvans explains the complex structure of these ethnicities. The social structures of both societies rested upon patrilineal clans, where all relatives of one's father comprise a settlement (hoton or aal). Kinship, clan identities, knowledge of your relatives and genealogy was extremely important. However, the internal structure of an ethnicity was more complex and did not limit itself to clans, especially among Kalmyks. The events of the 20th century have had contradictory impact on the ethnosocial processes, but definitely failed to fully transform the basic social structures of both ethnicities. For a number of decades, proud display of belonging to a kinship group has been seen as an element of `parochial thinking', but the clan identity never lost its edge.
   Declarative forms of sub-ethnic differentiations can be found in events, public attributions and talks, or indeed any other activity openly acknowledged by its subject as a form of revival of ethnic culture. In this context, clan groups are accepted as an integral part of traditional culture. Non-declarative forms, in contrast, reveal themselves without lofty goals. They are used in the field of everyday social and ethnic relations, especially when an economic or political issue has to be addressed by a group of interconnected individuals.
   The sociodemographic and migration-related regional processes as such do not indicate any physical split within an ethnicity, which would have predicted its future collapse and the arrival of new entities. On the contrary, increasing urbanization, the out-migration from the countryside and other interethnic issues arise where various kinship groups which had been living separately now flock to the same area. The authors believe that accentuating the issue of ethnicities' internal complexity, as well as acknowledging the presents of composite kinship groups, will help actualize the role of ethnicity in contemporary society.

TI THE HUMAN POTENTIONAL OF RUSSIAN WORKERS: VALUES AND ATTITUDES
SO JOURNAL OF INSTITUTIONAL STUDIES
LA Russian
DT Article
DE workers; human potential; human capital; values; life success;
   education; well-being
ID INVESTMENT
AB The empirical basis of the analysis undertaken in the article was the materials of the project "The dynamics of social transformation of modern Russia in the socio-economic, political, sociocultural and ethno-religious contexts" which was carried out in March 2016 by the Institute of Sociology of the Russian Academy of Sciences. On the example of the perception of "life success" concept the author analyzes certain features of the values and attitudes of various professional groups, first of all the workers. The value priorities of the workers are considered as a component of their human potential which is interpreted through the extensive characterization of human capital. Two models of "life success" are singled out - the basic model, determined by the generally accepted cultural norms and values in the society, and the individualized model which is formed by the interests and needs of the individual. In both cases the workers are characterized by a less emphasis on values related to work activity than other professional groups. This is expressed both in a smaller number of such values among the significant values for them and in the general blurring of their value orientations in this area. At the same time from the point of view of classical labor values that affect the quality of their human capital as a combination of knowledge and skills, the specificity of workers is shown mainly in the lack of attention to "education" as an independent value. The workers associate life success not so much with the education they receive but also with practical activity (the value of "work"). It is also shown that one should not expect from workers independent actions, due to the internal need for self-development to increase their human capital. This will require special measures to stimulate them, and for workers under the age of 40 with such stimulation the emphasis should be done on professional growth and career opportunities associated with it, and for workers over 40 it is advisable to expand the use of traditional for the domestic production culture artel forms of labour organization. Besides, considering the importance of the "financial well-being" value for workers in general, such stimulation should be based on the workers' orientation to maximizing their earnings, i.e. their qualifications should be much more strongly correlated with their wages than it is in modern Russian society.

TI Putin's Political Regime and Its Alternatives
SO STRATEGIC ANALYSIS
LA English
DT Article
AB The article analyses the current Russian regime and its possible alternatives, both nationalist and pro-Western, from the viewpoint of various theoretical approaches. It argues that applying the criteria and terminology of political science, which are usually used in studies of modern Western societies, to define contemporary Russia's social and economic system is just as pointless as describing its political system in terms of the modern Western political system. It further states that to achieve an economic breakthrough, the Russian leadership will have to move towards: developing state institutions that are governed by the rule of law; the separation of powers; the restoration of self-government; and the creation of favourable conditions for, primarily, small and medium-size businesses.

   education at home; higher education; cross-cultural communication
AB Internationalisation of higher education at home is a relatively new phenomenon for Russia but, as a concept, it is one that is both broad and variable. The internationalisation of higher education at home has been influenced by the globalisation of economies and societies and the increased importance of knowledge. It is driven by a dynamic and constantly evolving combination of political, economic, socio-cultural and academic rationales. These motives take different forms and dimensions in different regions, in institutions and within their educational programmes. This study covers an intensive course named "Cross-cultural Communication" and its impact within Tempus, Erasmus+ and other funding programmes as well as traditional content of this course. The content of the course is evaluated through several approaches. The starting point is to consider how particular courses are taken into account in long-term strategies of universities, and on the other hand, how these intensive courses advance the implementation of internalisation strategies. Another approach concerns internationalisation at home and helps find out how, specifically, intensive courses advance internationalisation. The next point covers education and teaching development and shows what role particular courses have in the transfer of teaching methods, materials and whole course concepts in Russian higher education institutions.

TI MODERN BARBARISM: REASONS AND CONSEQUENCES
SO POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY
   OF POLITICS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE barbarism; civilization; the revolt of the masses; vertical invasion of
   barbarians; mass man
AB The article is devoted to the analysis of the phenomenon of "barbarism", which is still relevant today for the public and political sphere. The authors focus on the so-called "vertical barbarism". In contrast to the "horizontal barbarism", which is known since the ancient times, "vertical barbarism" is not associated with the direct clash of peoples, but rather with complex social processes, primarily, powerful vertical mobility and vast expansion of the access of broad social strata to the achievements of civilization.
   The authors believe that the birth of the "vertical barbarism" is associated with the phenomenon described as "the revolt of the masses" by Jose Ortega y Gasset, the Spanish philosopher. This is one of the most important social and cultural shifts in the history of mankind, when the development of democracy and industrial technologies resulted in a new space for people's existence and brought to the forefront of public and political life the "man of the masses". "The revolt of the masses" in the first half of the 20th century entailed a wave of the "vertical barbarism" across Europe, which resulted in the establishment of fascist, Nazi and right-wing authoritarian regimes in several European countries. After the end of the World War II, the first wave of the "vertical barbarism" rolled back, and the consumer society started to develop, in which a "mass man" turned from an aggressive political subject into a relatively passive political object.
   The authors interpret the recent political wakeup of a "mass man" as a new wave of the "vertical barbarism". In their opinion, this wave is caused by the fear and frustration of a "mass man" who failed to adapt to the vast expansion of the space for her life and the qualitative change in the social sphere engendered by the development of democracy and the technological revolution of the late 20th - early 21st century. The lack of proper attention from the political forces and structures to the ongoing shifts aggravates the situation, making a "mass man" feel "abandoned" by the power and the state, which encourages her to rebel against the established order and throw out a challenge to the modern civilization.

AB The article is devoted to the history and development of Russian market of political technologies and profession of political consultant, which are treated as a special phenomenon that has influenced and continues to influence the historical destiny of the country. The author identifies seven stages in the history of the development of the domestic political technology market that coincide with the stages of development of statehood and democratic institutions in modern Russia: 1) The emergence of the market. "The political enthusiasm" (1985-1993); 2) Legitimization and mythologizing of political consulting and political technologies in Russia (1993-1996); 3) The "Golden Age" of political technologies in Russia (1996-2000); 4) The stagnation of the market and administration (2000-2004); 5) "Clinical death" of the market for political technologies (2004-2008); 6) The degradation of traditional technologies and the transfer of creative activity in the Internet space (2008-2011); 7) The revival of the market for political technologies (2011-2015). Electoral technologies are directly related to the parameters of the political system in the country as well. The author analyzes the landmark election campaigns since the early 1990s to 2014, sets the pattern of development of political technologies in the Russian reality and gives his own interpretation of the key trends in the organization of modern political process. The author points out that the profession of political consultant / in the field of political technologies in Russia has a broader application than in the so-called developed democracies, and that Russian professionals in this sphere are, as a rule, better qualified. According to the author, the demand for high qualified political technologists will continue to grow, despite the "folding of democratic project", according to some experts.

AB The article considers the trends and patterns of foreign direct investment in the Russian economy in the context of mega-regions, the features of attracting and spatial distribution of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the regions of the Far East. The purpose for the study is to assess the economic effects generated by foreign investment in the Far East. The hypothesis is the assumption that attracting foreign investment in the region is to a greater extent a tool to maximize the economy of scale, rather than eliminating financial imbalances. The initial data of the study are statistical materials of the Central Bank, as well as macroeconomic indicators published by federal and regional statistical agencies. The methodological framework of the study is the concept of modern general theory of foreign direct investment, in particular the concept of spatial distribution of foreign investment. The article presents the assessment results of spatial performance and modification of the spatial-sectoral structure of foreign investment in the Far East, and the macroeconomic effects of their application. A new scientific result is a study to assess the impact of special institutional regimes formed in the Far East on the performance and structure of foreign investment, showing the possibilities and limitations of the stimulating effect of these regimes. The interval values of scale and structure of attracting foreign investment in the future have been determined. The research substantiates the hypothesis that the main motive for investors' strategic choice is natural rent seeking based on the access to mineral deposits (both hydrocarbons and other resources) and processing of natural resources; and this motive is invariant in relation to political and institutional innovation. The results of the study are applicable in the framework of applied regional analysis and regional economic policy-making. An important area of further research is modeling investment transfers between the countries of North-East Asia and the Russian Far East.

TI POLITICAL STABILITY THE GEORGIAN WAY (Georgia after the 2016 elections)
SO MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Georgia; parliamentary elections; constitutional reform; Saakashvili;
   Ivanishvili; Georgia-Russia relations
AB The article analyzes political processes in Georgia, the dynamics of its political system, the role of Bidzina Ivanishvili as an "informal leader of the country." Stepping into the shade, Ivanishvili remains the most influential and powerful person in Georgia, which without any serious loss allowed him to clear the coalition "Georgian Dream" of former political allies who became a burden to it. The research examines the process of its reformatting from a motley coalition into a political party controlled by one leader, as well as conditions that resulted in the victory of the ruling party ("Georgian Dream") at parliamentary elections in October 2016, and the split of the main opposition force - the "United National Movement". The main task of the ruling party and the ruling elite after the victory is the adoption of a new Constitution changing the electoral system and the President election system. In these circumstances, the dialogue with Russia having distinct "red lines" was put into cold storage. Some kind of normalization was achieved in 2012-2015 by stimulating the activation of economic contacts between Russia and Georgia. In the near future, there is no reason to expect any positive changes in bilateral relations. Furthermore, the socio-economic situation in Georgia is rather unstable, which is associated with devaluation of the lari, high fiscal deficit, lack of economic growth, high dependence of the Georgian economy on external factors, growth of external debt. A positive factor is the tourism boom, in particular owing to Russian tourists. Within the last three years, a huge tourist flow actually covered Georgia, with unprecedented numbers compared to the whole previous post-Soviet period. It is evident, however, that political stability achieved at the moment is fragile and temporary. In addition, there is public demand for the emergence of a "third force". In this context, even the least important incident can play the role of a detonator.

AB This article aims to analyse the connection between the election to the Russian State Duma in September 2016 and the social network activity of members of the two non-parliamentary opposition groups: right-wing radicals and supporters of the opposition leader Alexei Navalny. For this purpose, the Right-Wing Online Activity Index and Navalny Supporters' Online Activity Index were calculated. Then, using correlation analysis, relationships between the indices and the results of voting for political parties in the election to the State Duma were determined. As a result, the highest values of the Right-Wing and Navalny Supporters' Online Activity Indices were registered in Moscow and St. Petersburg.

TI TERRITORIAL AND SPATIAL IDENTITY: NEW APPROARCH TO THE BASIC CONCEPTS
SO SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE territorial identity; spatial identity; relative space; social space;
   critical geopolitics
AB Contrary to popular belief, the spatial aspect of political processes is determined not only by objective factors. Space affects politics not only directly, but also indirectly, through subjective and sometimes distorted notions of space, formed by man. To study this subjective world, geography has its own terminology, some of which are in dialectical connection with the concepts of "objective" geography (territoriality vs. spatiality, absolute vs. relative space), and some are unique for the discourse of this science (heterotopy, spatial inversion, spatial experience, the place of memory, spatial myth, and co-spatiality). The key to political geography is the notion of territorial and spatial identity, because they link ideas about space with the political behavior of the individual. Recently, the applied sphere of political geography has been actively developing, based on the application of identity knowledge - territory branding based on place policy.

AB The article analyzes the key factors, trends and prospects for the transformation of political spaces in the context of transition to a polycentric world order. In this, transformation of political spaces is understood primarily as a change in the structure of relations of political actors operating in the politico-institutional, socio-political, and the sphere of identity policy, resulting in a change in their geopolitical significance and status in the world politics. The authors emphasize the following factors due to their significant impact on the transformation and reconfiguration of political spaces: 1) increasing role in the world politics and economy of non-Western countries; 2) migration crisis and the cleavage among the EU and U.S. elites; 3) phenomenon of secession, separatism and "new nationalism" in the EUcountries; 4) aggravation of U.S. relations with Russia, China and the EU; 5) contradictory consequences of technological, social and political innovations. The authors focus on the analytical and forecasting potential of the institutional, world-system and systemevolutionary approaches to the study of the reshuffling of political spaces - both that already take place and that are likely to happen in the coming 25 years. The authors show that in the modern era, the reformatting of political spaces (including rising separatism, regional conflicts and geopolitical shifts) relates primarily with the competitive dynamics of world or regional centers of political, economic and military power that shape various regional alliances and associations around them. Based on the analysis of this trend in the selected temporal perspective, the authors outline and describe the most probable scenarios of large-scale reshaping of political spaces and geopolitical shifts towards the polycentric world-order.

TI EMIGRATION FROM RUSSIA: ABOUT CONCEPTUAL CATEGORIES
SO SOTSIOLOGICHESKIE ISSLEDOVANIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE emigration; Russia; Diaspora; Russian-speaking communities; return
   migration; compatriots
AB The article is an attempt to conceptualize and substantiate the concepts that characterize the process and result of emigration from Russia and the former USSR. The key concepts characterizing the Russian-speaking population abroad, as well as the definitions and terminology of return migration to Russia are: "Russians", "emigrants from Russia", "Russian by origin", "population with Russian roots", "born in Russia", etc. The author's interpretation of certain concepts and categories characterizing emigration from Russia is proposed. It is proved that the term "Russian-speaking communities" reflects more clearly the characteristics of Russians abroad than the "Russian Diaspora". The arguments for using this terminology are offered: Russians living abroad represent a very diverse ethnic, religious, social and political group of the population; Russians in many countries are integrating well into host societies, already in the first generation are so successful that they are trying to give up signs of national identity; Russians have little or no ethnic consolidation and compact living. The key components of the formation of the Russian-speaking population abroad are outlined: emigration, the disintegration of the USSR, natural movement, transformation of identity. Domestic and foreign sources of information on emigration are described in detail. On the basis of a comparison of the data of Russian and foreign statistics, estimates are given of the number of different categories of emigrants from Russia and the countries of the former USSR. The concepts and tendencies of the return migration of the Russian-speaking population to Russia are indicated. The estimate of migration potential in foreign countries for Russia is given. It is argued that the implementation of the migration potential requires not so much pushing conditions in the countries of their current residence, but a more reasonable migration policy and an attractive social and economic situation in Russia. It is noted that there is no single and universal concept that would include all the totality and diversity of natives of Russia and people speaking Russian. The state policy of Russia in working with compatriots abroad should be more diversified, include more diverse instruments of interaction. The motivation, interests and guidelines of the population, their migration attitudes, and the socio-demographic structure require additional in-depth study.

DE Personality; social activity of students; educational activity
AB Social activity of young people is the basis for innovative social development, civil and creative initiatives that affect social democratization. The problem of social activity of the student youth is interdisciplinary, as it is located at the crossroads of psychology, pedagogy and sociology. The relevance of the problem can be explained by the need to analyse factors of young people's social activity. This type of scientific knowledge will make it possible to gain better understanding of differentiated attitude of students to different types of activity, to support the most important forms of activity that affect students' socialization, grasping the attitudes of innovation and competence, values of civic and educational activity, and volunteerism.
   The purpose of the present study is to investigate psychological factors of students' social activity in the province and in the capital city (based on the analysis of a number of tests performed in Saratov region and Moscow, Russia).
   400 students from Saratov region and Moscow (Russia) took part in the study. They filled out questionnaires and tests. The value-related sphere and its proneness to conflict were studied using T. Fantalova's technique; the modified methodology of J. Mutod's method called "d'induction motivatio nnelle "(MIM) was used to reveal basic meaningful categories of social activity (a questionnaire was developed with open and closed questions covering a number of spheres); the test of social psychological adjustment (SPA) by C. Rogers-R. Diamond (TSPAD); The Basic Needs Satisfaction Scale (SBNS) Mary M. Johnston, Sara J. Finney; 11 unique scales were used to assess preferences of social activity and behavior.
   It has been shown that social activity of the student youth is highly differentiated: the most preferable types of activity are hobby-related and educational activity, and the least expressed types of activity are political and subcultural activity, regardless of the region. The remaining activities are used to varying degrees. Social activity of students from the province and from the capital city is conditioned by different meaningful categories, which form two factors: the meanings of family and love (Saratov) and career and independence (Moscow). Social activity in the future as understood by the students of the province and the capital is related to the achievement of well-being and prosperity (53% vs. 71%), belief in prospects (21% vs. 39%), self-actualization (33% vs. 32%). The provincial students have strong hopes for external forces (God, the state) (21% versus 3%). The social activity of students in the province and in the capital is determined by different levels of value differentiation: the capital youth demonstrates low differentiation, while the provincial youth high level of differentiation (the difference index is 3.7 versus 7.8).
   The differences in factors of social activity of the student youth in the capital city and in the region are associated with adherence to traditional values (the region) and hedonistic values (capital city), different meaningful factors, and the notion of the future. Conclusions regarding the prospects of the results of the study for educational practice of higher education institutions have been made. The study explains the need for students' inclusion into voluntary associations, support of civic initiatives, as well as individual activity and leadership. Subsequent studies are related to the definition of basic needs and characteristics of subjective well-being as factors of various forms of students' social activity.

AB The European community's response to a sweeping growth of value of intellectual resources in late the late XX - early XXI century was to initiate seven consecutive framework programs, aimed at support and intensification of European scientific co-operation during the period from 1983 till 2013. The new phase, which influenced higher education and the European scientific community, was the Lisbon Process, aimed at increase of Europe's competitiveness and creation of Europe of Knowledge. European scientific community's goal became the achievement of a unified research and area. In the article the author offers a detailed analysis of the most voluminous program for support of research and innovation in the history of the EU - "Horizon 2020" with a total budget of 80 billion euro aimed at the completion of European Research Area. The author considers three pillars, which the program is based on: excellent science, industrial leadership, and societal challenges. The article examines economic and political circumstances, which have led to the adoption of the Horizon 2020. The author concludes that the program reflects the interests of the scientific community: it consistently accentuates such problems as climate change and Europe's technological gap in relation to the U.S., both of which threaten dire consequences and can only be addressed by scientists. However, it prioritizes the interests of a small group of leading researchers connected to leading universities and transnational corporations, which become to be identified as the European scientific community.

DT Article
DE ROC; religion; politics; conservative turn; Orthodoxy; inauguration
AB Russia recently experienced a so called "conservative turn", which was accompanied by a significant strengthening of the Russian Orthodox Church's (ROC) role in social and political life. The increasingly frequent participation of bishops in official state events, including inaugurations, reflects this trend. On the basis of the analysis of the speeches of the Orthodox clergy at inauguration ceremonies of the heads of subjects of the Russian Federation in 2012-2017, the author shows that the "conservative turn" did not leave the ROC untouched. The author was able to spot an "authoritarian" message in the overwhelming majority of speeches. Not only does the Orthodox clergy emphasize spiritual and moral values, which are interpreted as the foundation of state, but it also shows strong support for the lack of alternation of power, ties success and prosperity of regions to the cooperation of regional authorities with the Church and insists on the divine nature of power per se. If in the early 1990s the ROC criticized the "compulsory statehood", which deprived people of the opportunity and desire to think independently, and proclaimed principles of equality, freedom and spiritual revival, today its discourse fits perfectly into the conservative discourse of the authorities. According to the author's conclusion, the leadership of the ROC should be regarded as part of the "conservative coalition" of modern Russia. Such acknowledgment opens up opportunities for a deeper understanding of the reasons for the transformation of the Russian political regime.

AB In the conditions of Internet evolution as an independent space of social and political communications, traditional approaches to impact on mass consciousness acquire a new sound and potential associated with the emergence of new tools for digital communications. In this regard, the rethinking of classical models and methods of socio-political stereotyping and mythologization seems to us an actual task for contemporary science. The aim of this paper is to conceptualize the problem of applying digital stigmatization in socially-manipulative practice - social and political technologies of sticking labels and markers by political actors to their opponents in the space of social media. Analysis of contemporary political practice demonstrates that digital stigmatization technologies are today becoming a serious tool for conducting political struggle for the conquest and retention of power that has a significant potential for influencing mass consciousness. According to authors, the activity of political opponents is coded by politically and informationaly influential actors as an activity of carriers of deviant behavior, which is a threat to society and the state. The work determines the essential role of tools for the formation of specific conditions in the network space that change the interpretation of political life with the help of digital stigma. The authors come to the conclusion that the subjects of stigmatization in modern practice in many cases are directly institutes of political power, which attempt to establish information control over society in their own interests, using for this purpose modern digital technologies of stereotyping and mythologization of socio-political reality.

AB When considering the concept of proof in the context of a type-theoretic approach, one should refer to the concepts of (1) proof of a computer program correctness, (2) proof of mathematical results by means of special computer tools, (3) proof from the point of view of the modern type-theoretical approach within the framework of univalent foundations of mathematics. This paper is devoted to the concept of proof of computer program correctness. Currently, computing devices surround us almost everywhere and are found in virtually every human activity. We are all interested in the correct functioning of our computers, so errors occur as rarely as possible, and at best do not occur at all. A formal proof using type inference gives certainty, provided that the formal system used in the proof is consistent and correctly implemented as a programming language. One of the purposes for which proof is formulated is to increase the degree of confidence. However, the proof itself does not give any conviction. If our belief in a proof is belief in the existence of pure formal proof, then the nature of mathematics is radically different from the nature of other sciences. If our belief implies a certain proportion of probability, then mathematics turns out to be similar to the natural sciences. The proof of the mathematical result is a "message", and not some ideal object. The social aspect of mathematical results greatly enhances conviction. In fact, it leads to the stabilization of key concepts, after which the result becomes part of recognized mathematical knowledge, and conviction in it may be sufficient to belief in the existence of purely formal proof. Proof of the computer program correctness does not have this characteristic. Further, it is assumed that the execution of the program leads to a change in the physical state of a particular computer. Since we cannot have a priori proofs for the a posteriori phenomenon, a number of researchers suggest that the concept of proof of correctness is a categorical error. Nevertheless, it is necessary to take into account the peculiarities of the concepts of abstraction and information hiding in computer science. With a careful approach, the concept of proof of correctness is quite reasonable and does not contain a categorical error.

DE inorodtsy; Orientalism; internal colonization; modern imperial history;

AB The main aim of this research is the identification of various interpretations of the term "inorodtsy" (non-Russians) in the discourses of the Russian Empire. The authors have set the following research objectives: to allocate the main discourses raising the foreign question in the Russian Empire; to define features of perception of the foreign question within various discourses. In modern science. the question of the content of the term "inorodtsy" in the Russian Empire is considered, as a rule, through an Orientalism prism. Within the theory of "internal colonization", this concept is treated as an ethnic category, representatives of "modern imperial history" speak about foreigners as an artificially designed social community. The methodological basis of the research is a multiple factor approach assuming the existence of several multidirectional discourses created by various actors. Based on the Collection of laws of the Russian Empire, the Code of Laws of the Russian Empire, journalistic works and academic research, the authors identify power, socio-political and academic discourses differing both in the interpretations of the term "inorodtsy" and in the judgments on the "inorodtsy" question. Within the power discourse, "inorodtsy" were considered as a separate class created for the most effective use of features of economy and self-government of some groups of the population for the benefit of the state. This position remained invariable throughout the existence of the Russian Empire. The socio-political discourse was not uniform, and the division was based on the political principle (the right and the left), and on the territorial one (Siberian and the discourse of European Russia). In the right discourse, "inorodtsy" were considered as "alien", hostile in relation to the Russian people, and included all non-Russian population of the western borderlands of the empire and the Volga region. For the left discourse, "inorodtsy" were understood as non Russian people of the empire restrained in the rights and therefore natural allies of the Russian people and society in fight for freedoms. The discourse about the Siberian "inorodtsy" united representatives of various currents in society that treated them as backward and harmless peoples of Siberia. The academic discourse was not uniform either. It was divided depending on the scientific direction. Within a legal discourse, foreigners were considered as a class, but with unclear criteria for separation. Within a historical discourse, this concept was ignored; in the ethnographic one, the concept covered indigenous peoples of the borderlands. The main conclusions are as follows: the concept "inorodtsy" of the Russian Empire repeatedly changed its content within various discourse practices, which does not allow to consider it only from positions of colonialism and Orientalism; political preferences and motives of authors determine features of the use of these or those interpretations of this term.

   scientific knowledge; concept of science; philosophy of science;

AB Introduction. In today's globalising world, science acquires a crucial importance: integrating humanity within the framework of solving global problems, it becomes one of the leading factors in social development, facilitating work and diversifying leisure time, as well as serving as an instrument of transformations in the political sphere. Undoubtedly, the social aspects of contemporary science are capturing the attention of a huge number of researchers. However, it is not clear that all areas of the sociology of science treat the object of their study in the same way.
   Aim. A lack of reflection on the unity or otherwise in the understanding of the essence of science in the various fields of sociological research makes it difficult to compare different theories of the institutional, cultural, social and communicative contexts of scientific development. An urgent methodological task therefore consists in developing an understanding of the various definitions of the concept of "science" used in the framework of contemporary sociological analysis of this phenomenon.
   Results and scientific novelty. In this paper, two dominant sociological views on science - as an experimental-mathematical approach to cognising the world and as a system of representations in general - are compared. We conclude that while researchers studying institutional aspects of science tend to interpret it in terms of the "heritage" of post-Enlightenment European rationalism, constructionist and communicatively-oriented researchers tend to approach science as the system of knowledge and cognition that is formed in any human society, having its own specific sociocultural features in each respective case. While each of these two approaches undoubtedly has its own methodological potential, in order to provide such a diverse field of studies with a common ground, it would be necessary to balance them with a third aspect. We argue that this balancing role, since both common for all mankind and unique for every culture, could be played by Heidegger's conceptualisation of science as "the theory of the real".
   Practical significance. In order to avoid a pluralism of incompatible theories, it is important to continually pose the question "what is the object of study when conducting a sociological study of various scientific phenomena?" - as well as to understand the "limits of applicability" of the particular interpretation of science on which basis sociological analysis proceeds.

Basing her analysis on a rich body of narrative sources and analytical literature, the author shows that the forming of "Europe's powder magazine" and the "Serbian question" as a reality of international relations of the nineteenth - twenty-first centuries has become not only the sequence of the clash of great powers' interests in the regions, but also the development of the internal contradictions of the Balkan countries. Extremely important in this sense is the disclosure of the peculiarity of the emergence and evolution of ethnic and historic mythology which in a crucial way has reflected in the construction and the entrenchment of the conflict model of statehood.

AB The article presents the results of study of the Central Asia natural region construction process, which has a long scientific tradition in Russia and in the world. It shows the evolution of this structure from a hypothesis to geographic, strategic and futurological constructions. While analyzing the empirics of Central Asian complexes, products of external actors' geopolitical activity in the post-Soviet space were identified and compared. Heuristics have been highlighted in a geographic discourse, which were also revealed in new approaches to modeling the political form of the region. The materials used to identify heuristics were the works of European authors (K. Ritter, F. Ratzel, A. Humboldt, V. Vogel) containing spatial hypotheses which created conditions for transformation of supranational institutions into post-national mechanisms for the management of a macroregion that took the form of a European states union. Current models of Central Asia are historically linked to heuristics of the geographic core of Asia and its transition zones. The objectification of historical and modern models allowed tracing the spatial transformation of the taxon, separating the geographic core from the new political formation denoted as "Central Asia of five states" (pentad). The contradiction between geographical and political discourses is caused by the Western community's perception of the post-Soviet space as a frontier, a unique part of which is Kazakhstan and the countries of Central Asia. It has been revealed that geographic principles in regional presentations being part of globally oriented survival strategies in modern models of external governance in Central Asia are being used improperly flexible; the use of dialogical technologies is called to embody the design aim in the form imposed on the transformed object of the future.

DE bioethics models; semiotic diagnostics; convergent technologies;

AB Bioethics aims to assess all the risks, consequences and conditions of the implementation of specific procedures from the position of any subject of biomedical manipulations. Therefore, firstly, the interpretation of the basic principles and rules of bioethics is given depending on the role of the doctor/researcher and a patient/research participant which the subject chooses, and, secondly, making such an interpretation is possible only at the level of the development of models of morally acceptable communications of biomedicine subjects. The indicated consequences enable us to formulate the assertion: bioethics exists in models and produces models. Since it is the communications and role of biomedical subjects that bioethics models regulate, a conclusion about the semiotic nature of these models has been made. The juxtaposition of respectable classifications of bioethics models (Emanuel E. & Emanuel L.), classical ethical systems and their axiological interpretations (R. Apressyan) makes it possible to determine the limits of applicability of bioethics models. The characteristic of these limits is given: the dependence on the predominant understanding of the good; the freedom to choose the understanding of the good; the activity in the choice of an individual goal; subordination to the goals of others. The similarity of these limits (freedom/dependence, activity/subordination) to the axes defining the 'phase space' has been established, which makes sense for assessing the consequences of the implementation of convergent technologies. The potential of bioethics to assess the consequences of biomedical innovations has been discussed. These abilities are the consequence of the fact that bioethics not only develops semiotic models, but also creates model ensembles. In such an ensemble, all the models have equal rights to exist because the main thing is their conjunction, their consistency, that is, their coherence. It is the modeling of coherence that allows bioethics to set analogues of the space of future states of anthropological systems transformed by innovations. It allows bioethics to implement the 'assembly' of all self-organization scenarios initiated by innovations. Without such an 'assembly', the assessment of innovations leads to the competition of prognoses, and each of them refers to the space determined by only one pair of axes, which results in a paradox: a refined assessment of the impact of convergent technologies leads to the divergence of the human future prognoses. The observed potential of bioethics, realizing the expertise of innovations as semiotic diagnostics of the 'phase space' of sociocultural systems, provides a sufficiently strict application of the concept apparatus of nonlinear dynamics without solving the measurement problem in humanitarian studies.

DE republic; ethnicity; regional identity; identity policy; regional
   symbol; language policy; positioning of a region
AB Introduction. The ethnic component is one of the most important foundations for regionalization of the political space and construction of the region. The relevance of the study is due to the fact that it should determine the possibilities and conditions for consolidation of territorial communities within certain identification systems. The purpose of the research is to identify the markers showing the presence of ethnicity in the identity of the republics of the Russian Federation as an indicator of correlation between the ethnic and regional identities.
   Materials and Methods. The study employed such sources of analysis as presentation materials and business cards of the republics of the Russian Federation, constitutions and regulations on regional symbols, language policies and programs managing interethnic relations as well as the development strategies of the republics. Discourse analysis and the method of in-depth expert interviews were also used.
   Results. The study has revealed the basic identifiers of a region that comprise ethnicity. It has proved that ethnicity can be considered a resource for development of a territory as a unique feature of the regional community. The resource of ethnicity is associated with the positioning based on the idea that the status of the republics as ethno-territorial units differs from the status of other regions and therefore is capable of bringing certain benefits.
   Discussion and Conclusion. The ethnic component is an important resource for positioning regional uniqueness of the community, including through cultivation of the idea of stability, diversity and peace in the republics. The identified markers can be used as indicators of the presence of ethnicity in the regional identity when conducting comparative studies. The practical effect is associated with the possibilities of using them when following the identity policy in the regions and that of harmonization of multiple identities.

AB The article deals with the historical interrelation of ontology and epistemology. The mechanisms of the transition from the history of epistemology to historical epistemology are discussed. It is shown that the transition from the history of ontology to historical ontology cannot be explained by analogy with the transition from the history of epistemology to historical epistemology. It is suggested that when epistemology becomes historical, it re-poses the question of realism, but it cannot answer it, remaining within its own boundaries. A number of discourses, which position themselves as historical ontology, are considered. It is shown that revolutionary changes in structures of knowledge and the transition from one system of a reflexive justification of knowledge to another reveal gaps between the conceptual and the conceptual. It is shown that these gaps contain an unavoidable ontological problem. It is asserted that if we have an idea of these discontinuities, then we have a representation and formulate knowledge about something other than knowledge itself, and thus we go beyond the boundaries of epistemology.

AB The European Union, as a supranational Union of a number developed European States in its new institutionalization, has consolidated some results of a long historical de-Christianization process. The authors show, on the examples of the founding documents of the European Union, as the religious values of Christianity give way to liberal-atheistic values of political correctness and multiculturalism, and as human rights have become a new sacred value, limiting Christianity. The article deals with the influence of the de-Christianization process on the rethinking of Christian canons, on the further transformation of Christian churches from the spiritual and social to the social and cultural Institute. On the basis of the analysis of the sociological surveys data it is concluded that Christianity turns from the confession of faith into a "culture model", religious cult actualizing at exceptional moments of life, Church rituals are replaced by secular holidays and events. The authors draw an important conclusion that under the threat of Islamization of Europe, with the constantly declining level of Christian religiosity, Christianity began to play a new role of "moral Bastion" in the public consciousness. This testifies the transformation of historical Christian values into cultural values, which are called to support the traditional identity in the European Union.

DE Revolution of 1917; M.B. Shatilov; museology; Tomsk regional museum
AB This article discusses the life and social activities of Mikhail Bonifatievitch Shatilov. Basing on authentic historical sources the authors identified the facts of his biography. Born into a family of rural teacher Shatilov was able to get a good education. As a student of Imperial Tomsk University, he became close with an outstanding investigator G.N. Potanin and took the interest in studying the Siberian history from him. Influenced by Potanin, Shatilov became an oblastnik, defended economic and social interests of Siberia before the central authorities.
   The beginning of Revolution 1917 led Shatilov to Socialists. He became Secretary of the Tomsk Committee for public order and security and, together with the Chairman of the Committee B.M. Ghan, organized the first revolutionary transformations in Tomsk province. With a view to strengthening the revolutionary authorities, Ghan and Shatilov initiated the creation of the People Assembly. Formed in May 1917, the Executive Committee of Tomsk Provincial People Assembly adopted all the powers of the Tomsk Committee for public order and security, and it was the only legitimate authority in Tomsk province until December 1917. Ghan was the Chairman of the Executive Committee of People Assembly, and Naumov and Shatilov were his deputies.
   At the end of 1917 Shatilov became a member of the Provisional Siberian Regional Council created by oblastniks as the Siberian Government. In January 1918, however, leaders of the Soviet power in Tomsk arrested Shatilov and other oblastniks. Just at that time, not arrested supporters of the Siberian Duma formed illegal Provisional Siberian Government and imposed Shatilov in his absence.
   In the summer of 1918 the Soviets were overthrown in Siberia, and the Siberian Regional Duma declared State independence of Siberia. Shatilov and other ministers of the Provisional Siberian Government came out of hiding. But they had only 4 months for their activities, and as a result of a fierce power struggle Shatilov and other members of the Government and the Siberian Duma were arrested. Under pain of death, Shatilov retired and ended his political career.
   During 1922-1933 Shatilov worked as the head of Tomsk Regional Museum. In short time he formed a healthy team, organized its collecting, attributing, exhibiting, and cultural and educational works. Shatilov expressed the ideas about the essence of the Museum, its research and educational functions, in his scientific publications, and they are interesting until now.
   Shatilov's submissions on Museum did not meet official principles on the Socialist restructuring of the Museum science. Else, he did not satisfy Soviet powers as socialist-revolutionist. He was arrested, and some years ago executed on charges of counter-revolutionary activity. Although later he was rehabilitated, his name and works were not allowed for study for a long time.
   Facts and judgments listed in the article allow you to put M.B. Shatilov in a number of prominent members of revolutionary events in Siberia, to position him as an outstanding Museum professional.

DE geo-economics; geopolitics; static and dynamic substructures;
   geo-economic picture of the world
AB Geo-economics is a scientific discipline that studies geopolitical doctrines and actions of states and other geopolitical entities from an economic perspective, which makes economic relations, geo-economic statuses of powers and geo-economic processes the basis for the division (association) of the world. In terms of its position in sciences, geo-economics can be considered as a sub-discipline of geopolitics, which itself is a sub-discipline of political science. It should be borne in mind that there are other views on this problem. In terms of content, geo-economics includes elements of geography, politics and economics, it is a borderline scientific discipline that combines and synthesises geographical, political and economic approaches and strategies for analysing the static and dynamic structure of the world, national and global geo-economic processes. The structure of geo-economics consists of statics and dynamics. The statics of geo-economics includes raw materials, production, including military production, commodity, finance, energy, tourism and other sectors of the world; the dynamics includes flows of goods, labour, finance, tourists, fans, etc. Geo-economics as a fixation of the connection of economics with politics, history, geography and national culture originated in the works of Fernand Braudel, Immanuel Wallerstein, Fritz Roerig, Friedrich Liszt. In Russia, various aspects of geo-economic concepts developed in Marxist political economy, in the works of N.D. Kondratyev, A.A. Bogdanov, V.P. Semenov-Tyan-Shansky, N.P. Oganovsky, in theories of the Eurasians. Modern geo-economics as a concept combining geopolitics and economics has been actively used in the 1980s-1990s, Its proponents attempt to link a wide range of problems of the world economy, economic geography, economic history, political science and conflictology. As a science, geo-economics has theoretical and empirical components. Theoretical geo-economics studies the effect of geopolitical and economic laws, creates its own theories and approaches, explores the multivariance of global economic development. Applied geo-economics pays more attention to solving practical problems, studying specific manifestations of geo-economic concepts and theories, determining exact values, for example, the geopolitical status of states, the values of their GDP, the specific boundaries of their geo-economic influence, the results of their geo-economic strategies. Ideas and theories, categories and terminology of geo-economics are now actively used in substantiating global strategies (including UN) and long-term national development strategies.

DE Alexander Herzen; Who is to Blame; feminism; Russian radicalism;
   political novel
AB The novel Who is to Blame? remained the most famous Herzen's work to Russian readers until the end of the nineteenth century, but in different periods of its existence in the reader's environment, various ideas turned out to be in demand by the public and had an impact on the socio-political agenda. In connection with specific historical events, not only the perception of the problems of the novel, but also the social composition of its readers changed. Initially, Herzen's novel had a specific addressee, people of "his circle", educated noblemen, the so-called "representatives of the advanced convictions of the 1840s". Then, in the 1850s and 1860s, the circle of readers expanded, for example, with raznochintsy, for which the noble problem was much less relevant. With a share of convention, it can be argued that for the first "group" the most important was the "socio-political" line of the novel and the relevant theme of a "superfluous man", with whom readers who belonged to the Herzen circle could associate themselves. For the second "group", readers of the 1850s and 1860s, the "family" line of the novel turned out to be more important, and, mainly, "key" was the question of the position of a woman in Russian society. The article attempts to interpret Herzen's novel in the context of the genesis of Russian feminism. The main focus is on the period of the 1850s-1860s. In its first part, the work presents the history of the relationship between Alexander Herzen and his wife Natalia in 1841-1845, when the family crisis helped Herzen to formulate the main provisions of Russian feminism. Herzen added Russian seriousness to the "frivolous" French feminism. The French then preached the "rehabilitation of the flesh" (the Saint-Simonian Enfantin spoke about it and called for rejecting the old family bourgeois morality and recalling the body), and "rehabilitation of the heart" (which George Sand called for, saying that love is a sacred feeling that can not be limited to marriage). Against this background, Herzen proposed, in fact, "rehabilitation of activities". He wrote that love is only one thing, not the whole life of a person; in addition to a small private life, there is a large public one, and a "mature" person is called, first of all, for the "world of common interests, artistic and scientific life". The second part analyses the novel Who is to Blame?, written in the period when Herzen tried to present the main findings of his feminist concept in the artistic form. The young intellectual Beltov, thrown into a boring provincial city, is "copied" from himself, and this is quite obvious. The descriptions of the weak character of the raznochinets Krutsifersky allow assuming that his thoughts were borrowed from Natalya. In the logic of Herzen, Krutsifersky is more to blame for the family drama because he is too devoted to his wife, because feelings become more important to him than activities. The article notes that the "family" line of the novel was most in demand by the reading public at the end of the 1850s and the beginning of the 1860s. Then, under the influence of the emerging "women's issue", Herzen's feminist ideas began to have an impact on the socio-political agenda.

ID DIVERSITY
AB Sharp and unpredictable shifts in population movements, imperfection and incompleteness of international migration statistics, regular revisions by the UN Population Division of previous estimates of the international migrant stock complicate assessing the current state and forecasting future developments in this field. Nevertheless, there are obvious changes in geography, dynamics, composition and forms of modern migration occurring in the context of the polycentric and, at the same time, transnational and increasingly interconnected world entering the period of globalization reformatting, economic turbulence and uncertainty, the growth of socio-political conflict, the establishment of postmodern social values and attitudes. These shifts outline the contours of a new model emerging in the global migration space. The territorial mobility of people is growing in the whole, but this process is multi-speed. The non-migration mobility is increasing noticeably. However, modern flows of long-term migrants are weakening, and the growth in their number is slowing. This indicates a decrease in migration activity. The role of settlement is likely to decline in the new migration paradigm. Migration is becoming increasingly fluid and incomplete. With the spread of temporary and circular movements occurring generally in developed regions, in the EU in particular, frontier and hybrid patterns of movements arise. They combine elements of short-term and long-term migration and those of non-migration mobility. The diversity of migrants and receiving population is growing. The development of these processes requires an improvement of migration statistics, as well as reforming the integration policies. A new geography of migration is being construed. It is characterized by the shift of human flows to the global South and their regionalization on the basis of integration platforms. The regionalization of movements in the South requires working-out and implementation of immigration and integration policies by developing States and the development of sub-global mechanisms for regulating human flows as well. Moreover, the architecture design of the global population movements' governance should be adjusted to the emerging migration model.

TI GERMANY AFTER "MIGRATION CRISIS": ECONOMY, POLITICS, AND SOCIETY
SO MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE international migration; immigration policy; "migration crisis";
   refugees; Germany; Far Right
AB The article examines the social and political situation in Germany after the so called "migration crisis". In the author's view, the very term "migration crisis" should not be taken for granted. First, the whole economic and political system undergoes a crisis; migration flows are the consequence but not the cause of this. Second, the situation around migration has been described in the academic literature in terms of crisis for some decades. Third, the framing of the 2015 events in terms of "crisis" diverts attention from the European politicians' miscalculations in the early 2010s. The author claims that the German chancellor's decision to allow entrance for a significant number of forced migrants in 2015-2016 was motivated not only by humanitarian reasons. Pragmatic reasons played a great part, too. It was assumed that the benefits of the inflow of an able-bodied population would exceed the costs in the long run. Despite all the frictions in the ruling elites, there is a basic consensus that the integration of newcomers will boost economy. Moreover, the "open door" policy towards refugees was of a short-term nature. In fact, it had been curtailed by the Spring 2016. Various measures had been taken to reduce undesirable immigration: the agreement with Turkey, the adding of Kosovo and a number of North African states plus Afghanistan to the list of "secure countries", facilitating of deportation procedures, the "Malta agreement" with Tripoli, negotiations with African governments on financial assistance in exchange for efforts to curb immigration, etc. Further, the author turns to the attitudes in the civil society toward immigrants and immigrants' integration and shows that the "proimmigrant" attitudes should not be underestimated. The majority of ordinary Germans are ready to incorporate the newcomers. At the same time, there is a significant population segment, especially in the East, which feels socially excluded. These people have been main voters of the "Alternative for Germany" (AfD) party. The author argues that the very presence of the Far Right in the Bundestag will have impact both on politics and public debate. It will make the decision-making concerning the immigrants' integration more difficult, although the AfD faction is too small to block such decisions. The Far Right could also contribute to the transformation of public discourse: due to their activity in the parliament and in mass media the ultra-nationalist rhetoric will stop being a taboo.

Their international competitiveness in the medium and long term depends on the success of digital transformation. This fully applies to the national economies of Germany and Russia. Both states pursue a policy of supporting digitalization in spheres of industry and services. Germany has more experience in this sphere. According to the main innovation indicators, RF and Germany are behind the world leaders. One of the ways to overcome this problem is to develop Russian-German digital cooperation, which is substantially weaker in comparison with the level of digital cooperation between FRG and other countries, especially China. The article covers issues of the available potential and prospects of bilateral cooperation in this area.

DE Psychological status of Russian society; images of authority and
   leaders; Presidential elections of 2018
AB This article analyzes the psychological transformations in Russian society before 2018 Presidential elections in comparison with the previous period. The study was carried out in several Russian regions in October 2017 and had a qualitative-quantitative character. This political-psychological study differs from the standard sociological polls in its' focus on emotional side of the images that enables us to reveal not only rational layer of the image but also to describe the unconscious one. Comparison of rational and unconscious aspects of authorities' and leaders' perception gives grounds for a more precise forecast of electoral behavior. The study undertaken in several Russian regions in October 2017 had two parts. The first part is focused on respondents' images of authorities, their political attitudes, concepts, values and images, as the second part deals with images of those Russian politicians who can take part in presidential elections of 2018. The article comes to a conclusion that while parliamentary elections of 2016 that were evaluated by experts as rather dull, still evoked some public interest, more important Presidential elections up to now were unable to mobilize the society. Political interest even declined and images of all politicians including Putin interest public less than before. Such political apathy and demobilization of society in a situation of serious external threats and attempts of insystemic opposition to destabilize the country from inside can cause a low level of turnout as well as general unpreparedness to sharp turns. The article shows that during a last year there was a growth of perception of authorities as ineffective. This evaluation have rowed down the topic of corruption, influence of oligarchs and managerial chaos. Institute of presidency seems still to be the most influential in citizens' eyes (94.3%). Our data have proved that citizens expect from politicians in general and presidential candidates in particular quite particular power motivation. Today voters will support politicians who go into politics not for money, ambitions or power as such but those who do something for people. This demand is clearly articulated these days and demand particular political behavior. In this respect Putin's image is most close to people's expectations (53.7% of those who see this type of motive in him). In general, we have found that that today's demands of the society towards authorities have changed since the previous electoral cycle. Whilst in 2012 the order, stability and struggle against corruption and oligarchs were the main demands to authorities, in 2017 it is the demand of efficacy and professionalism that dominate

DE world order; polycentrism; realism; liberalism; stability; governance
AB The paper maintains that there formed a consensus regarding key criteria of world order among a variety of theoretical approaches. Nevertheless, there remain serious disagreements which subject the issue of world order to political debates, theoretical, and academic discussions. Difficulties concern relations among concepts that aim to analyze changing structure of world order, attempts to combine descriptive and prescriptive parts, as well as principal differences between approaches of realists and liberals. The author stresses that these disagreements include those regarding main criteria, main actors, purpose of world order, means of legitimization, and main methods. This explains why mutual criticism of realists and liberals and their presentation of each other's viewpoints as incorrect is natural. Still, the noted consensus on key criteria of world order, the need to overcome problems in studying world order draws their attention to each other's arguments and allows for some theoretical dialogue. Rigorous usage of the concept "world order" refers to a desirable state of international relations, rather than reflects the current state of these relations. Nevertheless, the concept serves useful purpose among theoretical tools developed for analysis of development trends in international relations.

DE Soviet scientists; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Academic exchange
AB In the 1950s, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) engaged in close cooperation with the Soviet Academy of Sciences. The CAS sent scientists to the Soviet Academy to work as interns, study for advanced degrees, or engage in academic cooperation, and a large number of Soviet scientists were invited by the various institutes of the CAS to come to China to give lectures, direct research, help make scientific plans, and collaborate. The comprehensive cooperation between the two academies was launched at a time when the CAS institutes were in their embryonic stage, which suggests that the better-established Soviet scientists had the opportunity to play a dominate role. But the reality is not so straightforward. The case studies in this paper suggest that besides the influence of compatible political movements in China and the Soviet Union and bilateral ties between these two nations' scientific institutes, disharmony in actual working relationships prevented Soviet scientists from playing the role they might have envisioned within the CAS institutes. The rapid development of the cooperative relationship in a short span of time, combined with lack of experience on both sides, made for a disharmonious collaboration.

AB The paper deals historical memory as a field of research and practice. Different modes of thought, systems of norms and values of different academic disciplines (as well as of transdisciplinary practices) interact on this field. The authors of the paper take into consideration approaches of historians, sociologists, political scientists, journalists, political technologists. The authors stress that certain concepts of cognitive psychology are appropriate in philosophy of historical memory. By analogy to critical and substantial philosophy of history the authors distinguish critical and substantial philosophy of historical memory. Several modes of "political uses of the past" with corresponding politics of memory receive estimation in the paper. Consideration of history from the point of "technological determinism" seems to be relevant to politics of memory in present Russia. Serious challenges to Russian society cause importance of rethinking of historical experience of breakthroughs in science and technologies. It implies that knowledge of history of science and technology should be relocated into active memory of the society and processing of the knowledge should involve economic, legal and moral influences.

AB The article analyses the perception of the mid-to-late nineteenth-century Russian liberals of the West European states and their foreign policy of the time towards Russia. The article discloses the main features and differences in assessing the West and Russia as its part. It allows to reveal such features in Russian liberalism as common provisions and values typical of world liberal theory and a number of special features which resulted in developing different schools of liberal movement in Russia. The article underlines that the range of liberal ideas varied from selective borrowing of some elements of the western political system to their complete adaptation in Russia. The article focuses on the opinion of a number of national-oriented Russian liberals of the time who put forward a priority task to modernize the country, to implement liberal reforms, but not to strengthen its foreign policy power which, according to them, prevents improving well-being of the people and social stabilization.The study allows to define a main vector of the ideological pursuit of the Russian liberals, the part of whom tried to enroot the liberal ideas in the backward peasant country.

AB Social science debates about sources of generalized trust have prompted growing attention to how children develop faith in others. Much of the evidence, however, has come from relatively stable and prosperous societies. How might children's trust differ in societies that have experienced rapid and destabilizing transitions, as in postcommunist states? Using new evidence on Russia from three waves of a survey between 2006 and 2014, the authors show that children's trust is relatively low, reflecting low trust among parents, children's sense of economic insecurity, and their doubts about the fairness of key institutions. But rising cohorts since the early 2000s display more trust than their parents and than their earlier counterparts. Thus old patterns of distrust do not necessarily persist intact.

AB The political dilemma of introducing a progressive income tax in Russia is considered in this article. The role of this tax for the income part of the Russian consolidated budget is revealed, its impact on social inequality is shown. For this purpose, classical and the most recent studies on the relationship of income tax and social inequality have been analyzed. To discuss the appropriateness of the flat income tax scale abolition and its replacement by a progressive, the article proposes a simple two parameter model that allows for various scenario calculations of tax reform from the point of view of its influence on the budget revenues and social inequality. As a measure of social inequality is considered the Coefficient of funds (Coefficient of Rainbow). In order to carry out macroeconomic estimates correctly, the statistical data on the distribution of income of the population has been carefully calibrated. For this purpose, two calibration conditions were introduced, the implementation of which is mandatory to neutralize the distortion in the applied calculations. This procedure allowed to identify errors in the calculations of the three political factions that support the introduction of a progressive income tax scale (A Just Russia, the LDPR and the Communist party of the Russian Federation). The developed integral criterion and qualitative risk index allow to compare quantitatively different institutional strategies of introduction a progressive income tax scale more objectively. Applied calculations have shown that the introduction of a progressive income tax scale is currently premature and should be postponed until a more appropriate time.

AB The regulation of international scientific-technical cooperation in the Russian Federation aiming at improvement of managerial decisions in the field of scientific cooperation should take into account other countries' approaches. The article considers strategic documents of 19 countries to identify three types of them: the first group consists of countries with a special strategic document on international scientific- technical cooperation; the second group - of countries with a document on regional scientific-technical cooperation; the third group - of countries whose policies in the field of international scientific-technical cooperation are represented in national strategies for the development of science and technology and are integrated into action plans/strategies of the relevant departments. The article describes the organization of international scientific-technical cooperation in the USA, Mexico and Sweden. Thus, the USA developed a distributed system of coordination of international scientific activities under the uniform national approach, when science is considered an instrument of American foreign policy. Mexico follows a regional line in international scientific-technical cooperation without any special document regulating it. In Sweden, international scientific cooperation is considered a part of foreign policy and is administered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Based on the studied documents, the authors make several suggestions for Russian scientific-technical policy that have been already used in the draft Conception of International Scientific-Technical Cooperation of the Russian Federation. The authors propose to increase Russia's participation in the world scientific process by relying on the best practices of the global leaders such as the United States and Switzerland, promoting the development of scientific diplomacy and mobility, and supporting the political interests of Russia, in particular considering the CIS, BRICS and the EEA. The future legal documents should also include issues of funding joint research and assessing the effectiveness of cooperation (qualitative and quantitative indicators of the success of scientific collaborations).

The key thesis of the "new era" of China's socialism was supplemented by a new definition of the main contradiction in the Chinese society between the "people's need for a good life" and the "unbalanced insufficient" development. Former reference to "backwardness of social production forces" was abandoned due to recognition of real progress of the national economy; nevertheless, the basic characteristic of China as the largest developing country at the initial stage of socialism remained unchanged. According to the new strategy, China's modernization should be completed by 2035 that is 15 years ahead of the "three step program" outlined by Deng Xiaoping. The CPC promised to build a powerful modern nation by the middle of this century. New goals of development were not linked to the GDP growth figures in the context of China's transition from the stage of high-speed growth to the stage of high-quality economic growth. It provides the government with ample room for maneuver in the process of reforms implementation. The Congress underlined the importance of prevention of financial risks and proposed to build a healthy "two-pillar control system of monetary policy and macroprudential policy". Economic policy retained its pro-market orientation; reference to "promotion and protection of spirit of entrepreneurship" was an important positive signal for the non-state sector of Chinese economy. The Congress assigned normative status to "Xi Jinping Thought of New Era of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics", so a large set of concepts and slogans introduced by Xi Jinping over the past five years was included into the new version of the CPC Charter. Against the backdrop of increased centralization and personification of the CPC leadership system, the problem of power succession remained unsolved thus adding an element of uncertainty into Chinese politics. The CPC Congress expressed confidence in sustainability of China's development path and encouraged other countries to study the Chinese modernization experience. The article concludes that the 19th Congress provided favorable conditions for stable development of the Chinese economy, and the updated long-term strategy will make China's behavior on the global scene more predictable.

DT Article
DE social theory; Marxism; classes; primary accumulation; globalization
AB Modern Marxism is now going through a process of revival in social science. Marxist ideas have proved to be more resilient that was ever deemed by adepts of liberal reforms. The reasons why they survived in the last twenty years lies in the fact that capitalism, the main object of Marxist analysis does not only keep going, but also declines in many ways. In the modern world inequality is growing. The problems that seemed to have been done in the 20th century are back in force. Modern technologies and higher level of productive forces led to the rise of new problems and new contradictions that require a return to an adequate description by social theory. This is proved by the fact that Marxist schemata are often used to argue in favor of reforms that are essentially liberal. In particular, the Russian reforms relied on the idea of primary accumulation transformed into a popular myth. Marxist structural analysis can only become effective if it is applied to a concrete society and its political and economic order, The younger generation of sociologists learn Marxism for one more reason. Unlike many other sociological theories it kept improving its visions of society in line with the changes that occurred in them.

DT Article
DE Armenia; Nagorno-Karabakh; nation building; nationalism; political

   social network analysis; social networks
AB The article is devoted to the analysis of the discursive practices of Armenian nationalism that were used in media during the acute political crisis caused by the terroristic attack of Sasna Tsrer armed group in July 2016. 316 messages from Armenian mass media were analysed in order to define the groups of speakers ("coalitions") who used one of three major discursive strategies of representation of Sasna Tsrer: 1) approval, 2) justification or 3) condemnation. The composition and structure of each coalition was examined by mapping the social ties of speakers. The "condemnation coalition" mainly consisted of high-ranked state bureaucrats and members of the ruling parliamentary coalition, while the "approval coalition" mostly included liberal and nationalistic political parties and NGO representatives, Armenian diaspora members, influential performing artists and some Nagorno-Karabakh war veterans. Quantitative analysis showed that it was the "approval coalition" that dominated in the media discourse, while the condemnation strategy was marginalized. In R. Brubaker's terms, interpretative battle for the denomination and definition of the armed group's actions was lost by the ruling Armenian elites. Two competing interpretative frames clashed in the discourses on Sasna Tsrer. One of them is the statist frame (connected to condemnation strategy) and the other is counterstatist (connected to the strategy of approval). These two frames directly correspond to the two types of nationalist doctrines and movements, outlined by R. Brubaker, - the state-framed and the counter-state ones. Paradoxically in the studied case both types of nationalism appeal to the same nation, the Armenian one. It was B. Anderson who also noticed the ambivalent nature of nationalism, as it can be both a revolutionary force and a stabilizing one, but in the Armenian case this ambivalence is accompanied by a specific constellation of different types of capital (by P. Bourdieu). The analysis of the discourse of Sasna Tsrer shows that those who hold political and economic capital fail to convert it to symbolic capital, because of the weakness of the etatist frame on nation. At the same time the symbolic capital holders who position themselves discursively through the counter-etatist frame are deprived of political and economic capital.

LA English
DT Article
DE attitude; ideological structure of society; social groups; social
   contacts; the media; dynamics; probability of inter-group transitions
AB The goal of the present paper is to develop a special methodology for analyzing and forecasting mass social interactions; the methodology can be used in various studies of how social positions and opinions of the population are formed. The paper proposes a technique of mathematical modeling of mass social interactions in the context of a comprehensive interplay of social contacts, under the impact of information channels and the external environment. The model is based on substantial ideas about causeeffect relationships between the size of social groups and their changes as a result of mutual transitions, the ideas about how the views of other participants and various media influence socio-psychological attitudes, and about possible external impact on the effectiveness of propaganda. In contrast to commonly used differential equations focusing on the analysis of the stationary state, we propose to analyze the group size dynamics with the use of simple modifications of Markov chains when participants do not move from one group to another uniformly, but are distributed through several time periods, and the probabilities of such a transition depend on the current state. For this purpose, computer programs that express the iterative procedures of Markov chains with additional intermediate states are used. An important feature that distinguishes our approach from other models consists in the reliance on a sociological theory that requires social behavior be considered as dependent on variables such as socio-psychological attitudes of members of social groups. Our work also takes into account the factors that determine the attitudes, namely social contacts between people and information channels of different types available to the participants. With the help of simulation calculations, we show how this attitude may affect the intergroup transitions in the formation of a socio-ideological structure of society. In general, these models are a kind of situational stand where we can study the features of formation of the ideological structure of society. If statistical or expert data are available, then the model we have developed can be used to analyze regional socio-political issues.

AB Although the number of Twitter users is significantly lower than other social networks in our country (primarily, Vkontakte and Facebook), its social and political significance is quite high, due to both the network's technical features, and the specificity of public and political communication in modern Russia. Against the background of the strict state control over the key social media, Twitter is an independent and efficient platform for interactive exchange of information. During the protests on March 26, 2017, and immediately thereafter, Twitter not only supplemented (or even replaced) the federal media's role in disseminating important information, but also acted as a channel for social and political discussion and construction of offline networks.
   The article attempts to show how one can draw conclusions about the evolution of the Russian protest politics on the basis of the analysis of Twitter communication. The authors focus on whether Twitter messages shed light on the mechanisms of socio-political mobilization and protest potential in general.
   The conducted research shows that Twitter can be viewed as an effective tool of social and political mobilization, which opens up opportunities for overcoming collective action problem in the process of social movements formation. Twitter communication can help strengthen solidarity and crystallization of offline networks, by creating favorable conditions for collective action. At the same time, similar to other social networks, it can be used to mobilize not only the opposition, but also the loyalist segment of the society.

AB Everlasting controversy between religious and atheist worldviews is breaking out again at the current post-secular stage of Russian society. The contest of religious and atheist values is tightly connected with present-day political, social and cultural contradictions and conflicts. Which are the possible position and role of science here that mainly determines the image of the present-day world?
   The author suggests one of the possible variants of analyzing relations, interactions and heuristic opportunities of religion, atheism and science as forms of social consciousness. Whether science is close to atheism by its nature and is it really opposing to religion as it is often viewed? What are the grounds of scientific and atheist worldviews being made close? Whether science can be not only an ally of atheism but organic continuation of religious ideas as well? How do scientific and anti-scientific social and cultural orientations correlate with religious and atheist worldviews? Whether atheism can be characterized as a more rational worldview compared to religious one? How can religious irrationalism be quite rational whereas atheistic rationalism akin, at first view, to science appears to be a fundamental logic contradiction?
   The presented article attempts to look at these matters from a new angle, to find possible answers and make clearer complicated problems of interaction of religion, atheism and science in humanity's spiritual culture.

AB This article examines terminological and theoretical issues concerning the writing of the history of the Civil War and its connection with the 1917 Revolution: its chronology, its political and military dimensions and its psychological aspect. Archival funds from RGASPI (Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History), RGANI (Russian State Archive of Contemporary history), the Russian Academy of Sciences' Archive, the Gorky Archive at the Institute of World Literature and Art and the Manuscripts Department at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of Russian History. The authors examine how a military historical approach to the writing of the history of the Civil War, developed during the summer of 1930, was replaced by a political approach, developed between 1931-1932. Moreover, it examines how the chronological dating of the outset of the conflict changed over time. If early on, the Civil War was considered to have begun long before 1917 and the revolution of that year was held to have two phases - February and October - this all changed with Stalin's intervention in the book's editing during the summer of 1935. Stalin's intervention also broke all ties with earlier conceptions that connected these developments to the global place of the USSR and the country's foreign policy.

AB The article offers a systematic analysis of negotiation processes aimed at the settlement of the Syrian conflict. Special attention is paid to the negotiations in Geneva and Astana. Despite the fact that Geneva remains the main platform for the intra-Syrian dialogue, the large number of participants involved in the conflict, the stalemate of the situation, and the very broad agenda predetermined a tendency towards regionalization and particularization of the Syrian negotiation process. As a result, the process acquired a three-level format. The leading role in it is still played by the International Syria Support Group (ISSG) and the Geneva negotiations initiated by it, which approve all key political decisions on the Syrian conflict. The Astana talks sponsored by Russia, Turkey and Iran constitute an intermediate negotiating platform, whose main goal is to optimize the Geneva peace process, eliminating the military agenda from it. In addition, Astana serves to legitimize decisions adopted at the talks in Amman and Cairo with a more local status, which are, in turn, destined to complement Astana negotiations and bring a maximum number of parties to the table, required for the intra-Syrian dialogue.

AB A key aspect in the study of institutional risks is the formation of mechanisms for their state regulation. But the formation of such mechanisms is impossible without the presence of political and economic instruments to influence the factors that cause them. In all the diversity of these factors, the most important are those that determine the social sustainability of society, that is, determine its ability to reproduce its livelihoods. Among such factors, a special role belongs to demographic factors, on which the dynamics of the population and its age and sex structure depend. They determine the nature of the process of formation of labor resources, the size of the economically active population, the need to export or import labor, and in general the economic development of the country and the security of the state. In our study, we focused on the study of the most significant demographic factors that have the most significant impact on the formation of institutional risks. First, an analysis of depopulation showed that a reduction in the birth rate has a negative effect on the number of labor resources, leading to a reduction in labor supply in regions with negative population dynamics. This significantly affects the sustainable functioning of the labor market as an economic institution of society. Secondly, an analysis of external migration has revealed that the departure of highly skilled labor causes significant damage to the scientific and technical potential of many countries and is a consequence of the poor quality of the institutional environment in the field of science and education. The growth of labor immigration is accompanied by increased pressure on its social infrastructure, an increase in social tensions, and gives rise to migrant-phobia in the public consciousness. Thus, depopulation and external migration have a significant impact on the quantitative and qualitative components of the labor resources, thereby enhancing the formation of the institutional risks to its personnel security.

DT Article
DE foreign aid; China; Central Asia; Silk Road Economic Belt
AB The article deals with the conceptual framework of Chinese foreign aid, main goals and directions, mechanisms of its implementation and its efficiency evaluation by the example of Central Asian states. It has to be mentioned that Chinese approaches towards foreign aid used since the PRC was founded fundamentally differ from Western practices. China traditionally emphasizes its own status as a developing country and claims to be a proponent of the developing countries' interests. Moreover, Beijing tends to highlight that unlike Western countries, it does not use aid as an excuse for intervention in the internal affairs of foreign states. Central Asia plays an important role in Chinese aid policy mainly due to geographical proximity, Beijing's desire to maintain regional security, find additional sources of growth for the Chinese economy and get an access to mineral resources, which is especially important against the background of China's growing domestic demand for commodities and participation of Central Asian states in Beijing's trade and economic initiatives. Evaluating the efficiency of Chinese foreign aid programs, it should be noted that Beijing has managed to turn aid into an effective instrument of implementing its foreign policy interests, primarily, by creating pro-Chinese political and economic clientele hugely dependent on various forms of foreign aid. At the same time, an increase in the dependence of recipient countries on Chinese investments and economic assistance leads to a surge in anti-China sentiments in a number of regional countries which are apprehensive about the possibility to become a raw material appendage of Beijing.

AB The article is devoted to the coverage of foreign states in the Russian mass media. On the basis of the global news flow theory, which is applied to the analysis of the Russian media for the first time, the author considers what countries the Russian media discuss the most, analyzes factors that explain a number of news pieces devoted to this or the other foreign country, and compares agendas for television and newspapers. The empirical data include the materials from the most quoted Russian TV channels and print newspapers for the year of 2017, presented in the database Factiva. In total, the author analyzes 26269 mentions of foreign countries in TV news and 39171 mentions of foreign countries in the articles in print newspapers. In order to reveal factors that explain the Russian media's interest in different countries, the author builds several regression models. The independent variables include states' geographical and economic characteristics as well as the intensity of the direct contacts between countries.
   The research study demonstrates a rather important influence of the geographical, economic and relation-based factors on the number of mentions of this or the other state in the news. At the same time, the author identifies significant differences in the agendas between the Russian TV and the press. The final regression models that aggregate all variables have a much greater explanatory power in the case of the press than in the case of TV. The author hypothesizes that such differences may result from the fact that the Russian TV is more politically biased than the press and more responsive to the government demands. This may partially trump the importance of geographical, economic and other factors.

TI RELIGIOUS NONCONFORMITY IN MODERN RUSSIAN HISTORY
SO QUAESTIO ROSSICA

DT Article
DE religious dissidents; dissent; Pentecostals; emigration; Cold War; USSR
AB The author considers religious emigration in the late USSR with reference to Pentecostals (Christians of Evangelical Faith), focusing on the external and internal motives of emigration, measures taken by the authorities, and the attitude towards emigrants in the Protestant community. The author refers to public documents (analytical notes and reports of the Council for Religious Affairs), the ego-documents of believers (memoirs, letters, and statements), and documents of human rights organisations. The author describes the eschatological foundations of the theology of Pentecostals which underlay emigrational sentiments. She also singles out common reasons for emigration (violation of believers' rights, the incompatibility of a religious worldview and communist ideology, economic and everyday difficulties), as well as ones typical of Pentecostals (the absence of a legitimate union and the prophecy about Exodus). The Pentecostal emigrants followed the same pattern of action as other refuseniks, and their belief was kept up by religious rhetoric and support from foreign adherents of the same faith. As regards the Soviet religious community, its attitude to emigrants varied from support (petitions to protect them, donations) to disciplinary measures (exclusion from the community, penitence). The authorities resorted to a variety of measures to combat emigrantion (provocations, support of certain individuals, and pressure on family members). Their attitude to emigrants was an indicator of loyalty among registered communities or those seeking authorisation. The author concludes that the Pentecostal emigration movement did not succeed, becoming a mass one as late as the 1980s, after the socio-political situation in the country had changed. During the Cold War years, the Soviet government only allowed individual families to leave the country, using potential emigrants as proof of the fact that it respected civil rights and international treaties.

DE border; border area; critical geopolitics; political discourse; European
   integration; post-Soviet space; East-West dilemma; Russia; EU; NATO
AB The article is devoted to the study of evolution of public perceptions of new Russia's post-Soviet borderzone through the analysis of their representation in Russian press. "Nezavisimaya Gazeta" was chosen as a focus newspaper. The study is based on a database of publications collected through screening of this edition in four periods: 1994-1995, 2000-2003, 2008-2012 and 2013-2014. The newspapers titled "Sovetskaya Rossiya", "Zavtra" and "Novaya Gazeta" were used as the sources of additional information. It has been found that modernized East-West dilemma serves as a framework of these representations. Russia faces a fundamental choice between two vectors. The Western (European) vector means the rapprochement with the members of the EU and NATO, adoption of their values and development models. The Eastern (Eurasian) one implies total or partial reintegration of post-Soviet space and creation of new autonomous center of power within upcoming multi-polar world. Debate about the future of newly formed borders and the whole post-Soviet space, about building relations with former union republics on the one hand and the EU and NATO on the other, about aims and composition of regional integration projects etc. has invariably focused on the analysis of this dilemma. From the 1990th there were changes not only with the balance between two vectors within the media political discourse (non-contradicted in early 1990th they turned in the middle of 2010th into opposite sides of a dichotomy while the eastern vector appeared to be a dominant one) but also with their proper understanding. This article concerns with the Western part of two-faced discourse that reflects the transformation of collective West from focus of consolidation, source of economic and political modernization and a role model to key geopolitical rival which de facto plays a role of the Evil on the world political map.

ID MIGRANTS
AB Transformation of migration has a direct impact on the formation of the culture of the general population, level of education, spiritual development, moral values, public health, crime rates, stability of the political situation, and other factors. As a rule, the most educated part of migrants is a competition in the labour market for local residents, and less educated occupies those positions and professions that locals would not like to occupy or carry out. Managed migration processes can solve the problem of demographic crisis in the host countries, the lack of skilled labour restore the balance in the labour market. Chaotic, uncontrollable processes lead to disruption of social security processes, rising unemployment, rising crime rates and other negative consequences. Successful adaptation of migrants in the labour market depends on six key factors: 1) the actual level of education of migrants and their competencies; 2) a good knowledge of the language of the host country; 3) the sex and age of migrants; 4) psychological moods; 5) availability of jobs; 6) the desires of migrants themselves for training and labour integration. The main areas of demand are the services sector; engineering and technical sphere; the sphere of finance and the sphere of trade.

AB The article explores the causes and possible consequences of the critical instability of the modern world order, and the emerging fundamental institutional transformation arising from the search for ways to overcome this crisis of the modern world system. The analysis focuses on the of theoretical and methodological basis for a deeper understanding of the nature of this crisis and the identification of "points of growth" for new forms of interaction between the main subjects of world development, as well as new, more differentiated principles of global universalism, more sensitive to the cultural diversity of communities integrated into the global system of communities and of their political actors. The author discusses the phenomenon of "new powers", the complicated and symbiotic nature of their political organization, including transboundary formats for the distribution of control impulses, as well as their participation in the formation of new patterns of the world order. This analysis contributes to the formulation of a hypothesis about the essence( content) of a new system of international relations and territorial division of the world. Its essence: the exhaustion of the stability potential of the international system of national-territorial states gave rise in the course of historical development to irreversible dysfunction - a unipolar world order (the "lone superpower" syndrome). Overcoming this dysfunction is the main point on global transformation agenda in all its aspects: political, socio-economic, cultural, etc. Researchers studying these processes may have to reconsider the traditional optics of analysis, its conceptual bases and paradigmatic approaches in a critical manner.

DT Article
DE populism; constitutional reforms; constitutional retraditionalization;
   Eastern Europe; post-Soviet space; Russia
AB The article analyzes the contribution of populism, as a phenomenon of public sentiments, to the dynamics of the recent constitutional transformations in Eastern Europe, post-Soviet space and Russia. The research shows that in all countries from the above mentioned regions populism gave impetus to the processes of constitutional retraditionalization, which affected different areas such as international and national law, constitutional identity, sovereignty, forms of government, and constitutional justice.
   Everywhere the mechanisms of constitutional retraditionalization invoked by populism are associated with the denial of the principles of ideological pluralism and political neutrality of constitutional justice. However, the methods used in different countries vary considerably and cover the entire gamut of technologies of constitutional revision, ranging from the "conservative revolution" through convoking a constituent assembly or holding a national referendum to changing preambles of constitutions, introducing constitutional amendments, judicial interpretation, as well as a wide range of extra-constitutional mechanisms. The choice of a particular technology or a combination of technologies is determined by the level of public support for populist forces and the degree of their control over government institutions.
   Populism in Eastern Europe, post-Soviet space and Russia performs different functions. In the first case populism represents a way of accumulating protest against imperfect institutions; in the second case populism is a form of a struggle for establishing rules of the game; in the third case populism performs a function of mobilizing support for the current political regime, or a means of legitimizing it. In Eastern Europe constitutional populism serves as an instrument for achieving power, in the post-Soviet region - for its redistribution, and in Russia - for its preservation. On the basis of these differences, the author identifies three versions of constitutional populism - "democratic" (Eastern Europe), "oligarchic" (post-Soviet region), and "plebiscite", controlled and directed by power holders themselves (Russia).

AB The author analyses the reflection of the events of December 17, 1926, in Lithuania in the conversations of Soviet and Latvian diplomats and politicians. Soviet diplomats (charge d'affaires S. Borkusevich, consul general V.Shenshev) usually compiled a record of interviews for timely reports on the current political situation in Latvia and when the coup had occurred carried out the records of conversations with representatives of various Latvian political circles in connection with Lithuanian events. These materials were written in an atmosphere of extreme uncertainty and lack of reliable information, based even on gossips. Soviet diplomats, first, sought to find out whether the coup had been mounted under "foreign influence" (the possibility of Polish and German influence was discussed) and, secondly, to realize if the risk of a similar "far right" coup was real in Riga, especially when left cabinet had just come to power. The reports that were sent to Moscow (People's Commissariat of International Affairs) demonstrate both the attitude of various representatives of the political spectrum of Latvia to the Lithuanian coup and the complex international situation. The events of December 17, 1926, in Lithuania influenced the formation of the Soviet policy in Latvia. During the negotiations conducted with the center-left government of Latvia on a trade agreement the Soviet side had also take into account interests of the right-wing opposition representatives of the Peasants' Union of Latvia. A trade agreement with Latvia was concluded on June 2, 1927, and the representatives of the Peasants' Union gained certain benefits - thus, certain lessons from Lithuanian coup were drawn.

TI A CONFLICT IN THE BURYAT-MONGOL REGIONAL COMMITTEE OF THE RUSSIAN
   COMMUNIST PARTY OF THE BOLSHEVIKS: FORMAL AND INFORMAL TACTICS OF THE
   POWER GAME (MARCH-NOVEMBER 1925)

AB The article focuses on a conflict which took place in the Buryat-Mongol Oblast Committee of the RCP(b) leadership in March 1925. This conflict was latent and lasted for eight months. The author of this article has completed the predecessors' findings with extra assumptions based on new information. This includes minutes, abstracts of the minutes and shorthand notes of the party bodies' meetings at the Buryat-Mongol Oblast Committee as well as at the Central Committee and the Central Control Commission of the RCP(b), along with official statements and private correspondence of senior officials. The article shows that M.M. Sakhyanova's appointment as the Oblast Committee Secretary triggered the conflict. When A.I. Oshirov, a member of a well-to-do Buryat family, was elected into the Oblast Committee in March 1925, it was seen as M.M. Sakhyanova's attempt to strengthen her positions, as then he was her husband. A group of Buryat-born senior officials who were dissatisfied with this decision accused A. I. Oshirov of having a counter-revolutionary background and demanded to expel him from the Committee. However, M.N. Erbanov, the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Buryat Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, offered to solve the conflict in a different way - by appointing a new Oblast Committee secretary. The author of this article has identified all the participants of the conflict and found out their main motives. The article shows that the members of the so-called faction, the mere existence of which was against the party norms, rules, and traditions, were initially inclined to use informal tactics of power game. However, after the Central Committee and the Central Control Commission of the RCP(b) started investigation into this conflict, they had to apply extra methods, such as overt confrontation through speaking out at the Oblast Committee meetings and submission of official statements to the superior party bodies. The Oblast Committee Secretary M.M. Sakhyanova opposing the faction and Russian-born senior officials who supported her acted unlike the faction: openly almost from the very beginning: they brought up questions for discussion at the Oblast Committee and Oblast Control Commission, adopted appropriate resolutions and submitted the case to both the Siberian and Central Control Commissions. The conclusion is that M.M. Sakhyanova managed to retain her political position because she relied on official methods of power game only and had the support of the Central Committee of the RCP(b), which would not tolerate the Oblast Committee Secretary's demotion at the grassroots initiative. The Central Committee and the Central Control Commission approved Sakhyanova's actions and strongly rebuked the faction thus seemingly resolving the conflict. However, M.N. Erbanov, Sakhyanova's main opponent, maintained his position, so the Central Committee of the RCP(b) did not remove the root cause of the conflict to arise again.

   Russian revolution of 1905
AB Based on both published and unpublished documents on the history of the Imperial University of Tomsk, the article analyzes the social and political profiles of the Siberian professoriate during the period prior to the Russian revolution of 1917. What distinguished the 19th century Tomsk professoriate from that of the rest of Russia is that it was an entirely exogenous phenomenon in the city of Tomsk, with the first originally Siberian professors appearing by the early 20th century. In relation to the pre-revolutionary period in the Russian history, the notion of "Siberian professoriate" is identical with that of "Tomsk professoriate", the authors argue. A special attention is paid to the staff formation of the Imperial University of Tomsk as the first university in the Asiatic part of Russia. The article highlights how university centers in Russia's European part (St. Petersburg, Moscow, Kiev, Kazan, etc.) contributed to the staff formation of Tomsk University. The authors go on to examine the social origin of Tomsk professors as well as their political views and public activity. It is concluded that in terms of their social origin, the Tomsk (Siberian) professoriate was different from the university professorial staff in the European part of Russia by the predominance of professors having clerical origin. The Tomsk (Siberian) professoriate was the bearer of features essential for the Russian university at large, rather than for its specific area of existence. It produced a significant impact on the citizens' life through its educational, scientific, cultural, and political activities. As to political views, liberal (reformatory) orientation prevailed among Tomsk university community, which coincided with political preferences shared by the majority of university professors in the European part of Russia.

AB In the publication of the correspondence of Semyon Ludvigovich Frank and Albert Einstein, that is stored in the physician's archive at the Jewish University of Jerusalem, find their coverage the political events in Soviet Russia in the late 1920's - early 1930's. Letters keep their relevance for modern philosophers and humanitarians, as long as they expand the contextual field of our notions about the communication of Russian and European intellectuals of the first half of the XXth century, as well as their ideological shifts under the influence of what was happening. Frank analyzed the official sources (Soviet newspapers) of the time and tried to show Einstein their political and ideological bias, especially by covering high-profile judicial proceedings. It is exactly the worldview on Soviet Russia that Frank hold to during the years of emigrant life in Germany. The philosopher drew Einstein's attention to the abuses and law violations, that took place in Soviet Russia at that time. In letters to Einstein, Frank sought to get him to publicly condemn the actions of the Soviet government, in hope that it would contribute to stop the repressions. In the end, Frank managed to convince Einstein of the rightfulness of his position and to overcome his excessive caution and distrustfulness. The archive material published with the permission of the right holders has not been put into scientific circulation before and is printed for the first time.

DE family policy; mass media; pronatalism
ID POLITICS
AB The article analyses changes in how family relations are framed in the texts of independent mass media before and after the 'pronatalist turn' in Russian family policy in 2006. The research question problematises the whether the mass media is able to build strategies not only aimed at submission to political power, but also at resistance, especially in cases where mass media put themselves in a position of independent opposition to political influence. Culturomics, a research method geared towards cultural and social processes with the use of statistical analysis of how words and word combinations are used in a variety of texts, can be employed as a tool for gathering empirical data. Based on statistical analysis of word usage in the media, this paper considers how the frame-structure 'sem'ya' (family) typical of a certain period in the Russian family policy evolution is being constructed. The content of the articles depicting family relations in the media is subjected to statistical analysis of word combination ('trigrams') usage. The archives of a social and political online edition 'Gazetasu', the Russian daily social and political newspaper Kommersant; the daily analytical newspaper RBK; and the Russian weekly social and political newspaper 'Novaya gazeta' were all analysed (2000-2015). According to the results of the study, strategies of 'narrative resistance' are not actually used. It is concluded that political elites in Russia do not view family policy as a space for the realization of political interests.

This study has no analogues in Russia or abroad being a part of the international project "Dialogue partnership as a factor of stability and integration" ("Bridge between East and West") and of the program "Youth in poly-ethnic regions: Views, attitudes, and orientations" (the author is the initiator and head of the project and program) that for thirty years have monitored schools with a multi-ethnic composition of students. The monitoring aims to assess the development of values, attitudes and identity of the youth in different regions of the Russian Federation, the level of legal culture and how law-abiding the schoolchildren are, the protest activity and potential of younger generations, and the ways to develop appropriate and timely programs to prevent the youth's deviant behavior and illegal actions. The results of the surveys conducted within the program "Youth in poly-ethnic regions: Views, attitudes, and orientations" were compared with other Russian and foreign studies and presented at the international scientific forums: World Congress of Political Science in Berlin (1994), World Congress of Sociology in Montreal (1998), Russian Sociological Congresses (2000, 2008), Humanitarian Forum "Younger Generations - Life without Borders" (2011), UNESCO International Forum "Dialogue as a Path to Understanding" (2013), and at the "Week of Science and Education for Peace and Development" (2017).

SO VOPROSY FILOSOFII
LA Russian
DT Article
DE ideology; consciousness; practical philosophy; Soviet ideocracy;
   deideologization; constitution; modernization; traditionalism
AB The author of the article analyzes the features of judgement concerning ideology from the standpoint of philosophy. There is a need for external criticism and internal self-criticism of such judgments as potentially ideological. This is about shady and latent, ill-considered ideology, not only involved in politics or elsewhere, but also behind-the-scenes of philosophizing about anything, including the ideological. The relationship between philosophy and ideology is considered in the context of the Soviet and post-Soviet experience, as well as more general changes in post-modern reality. The features of the ideocracy of the Soviet model, which made it conditional and limited, are being identified. The emphasis is made on how the manifestations of the "power of the text" hide the real "power over the text". Special attention is paid to the expanded reproduction of canonical meanings in social space and historical time. Such mutations allow to use nominally the same ideology for very different political and social practices. The effects of "integration through misunderstanding" in the framework of a special kind of "negative hermeneutics" are considered. The author shows how illusionary are the ideas concerning realities and the very possibility of radical deideologization of public, intellectual and cultural life. The attempts of rehabilitation of official ideology in modern Russia are investigated and critically evaluated.

DT Article
DE Hannah Arendt; revolution; public realm; violence; social question;
   communication
AB The paper examines the relation between the public realm and revolution, the two central concepts of Hannah Arendt's political philosophy. This relation plays a key role in Arendt's theory of revolution, since the key purpose of a revolution is the liberation from oppression and the achievement of freedom, and the destruction of an old political realm and the creation of a new one, both of which are needed for the manifestation of free action. The main goal of our study is to analyze Arendt's idea of the influence of revolutions on the public realm by examining its theoretical and practical scopes. In order to verify the conclusions concerning the actual applicability of Arendt's theory of revolution, we analyze several cases of modern revolutions from that standpoint. Arendt's arguments concerning the causes of the failures of revolutions, made on the basis of several historical examples of revolutions from the 18th to the mid-20th century, are largely justified, even though these arguments still can be challenged to some extent. On the other hand, the analysis of the concrete examples demonstrates the limits of the applicability of this theory as a model of a description of contemporary revolutions. Although the theory has a number of significant advantages, it is still in need of considerable revision.

   social movements; protest activity; comparative sociology
ID COLLECTIVE ACTION; NEWSPAPER DATA; RUSSIA; CONTENTION; CONFLICT; CYCLES
AB In this paper, we analyze the scope and limits of protest event-analysis as a tool for studying political mobilization. Event-analysis is a form of content-analysis and allows for the reconstruction of the dynamics of contention and its key characteristics on the basis of different text sources (police and media reports, participatory observations, etc.). The inception of protest event-analysis is closely linked to the development of the comparative method in the social sciences and to the competition between the theories of collective action and social movements. The demand for wide cross-national comparisons and the quantification of social-political phenomena in addition to the pioneering works of Charles Tilly created the preconditions for a systematic collection of information on protest events. Four generations of event analysis led to the formulation of key concepts of collective action theory ("political opportunity structure", "cycle of protest", "repertoire of contention", etc.), and also improved the techniques and procedures of data collection process, for example, by introducing the triangulation of sources using semi-automated coding. We also analyze the sources of systematic bias in data collection process (selective, descriptive, and research) and the possible means of correction. In addition, we compare the event catalogs of Russian protests and point to specifics of this case, namely, spatial heterogeneity, poor quality of media reports in absence of alternative sources, and the bias in media coverage towards big cities. Using the experience of the "Contention Politics in Russia" database development, we propose systematic methods and means which address the challenges of protest event-analysis in regards to Russia.

The author considers the events in the Northern Black sea region, where the intervention took place, in the context of the Russian-Ukrainian realities of the revolutionary and civil war epoch, which mainly hindered the success of the intervention. The article demonstrates that the desire of the French leadership to be the organizer and guarantor of the post-war world order came into conflict with political tradition of France, the fatigue of the war and unexpected socio-political and military circumstances in the region.

AB This article considers the background and features of the formation of the Soviet model of mass sports and physical culture development in connection with the theory and practice of Soviet eugenicists of the 1920s. Eugenics was regarded as a promising science by some representatives of the political and scientific elite of Soviet Russia as a means of avoiding the threat of degeneration of the working class, caused by the consequences of exploitation, wars, and epidemics. The author focuses on the origins of Soviet eugenics which predetermined the main features of its development, analyses the views of its proponents from the government and academia as regarded turning to it in the struggle against the degeneration of the proletariat by means of sports and physical education. The main difference of Soviet eugenics was its class character, which was the most important reason for its opposition to fascist and bourgeois eugenics, and its main task was the cultivation of a "new Soviet man". The author concludes that some Soviet eugenicists considered the science of human improvement not only in connection with the study of heredity, but also physical culture. These aspirations led the Soviet eugenicists of the 1920s to support the utopia of a healthy body, to appeal to physical culture and sports as an important component of struggle against the degeneration of the Soviet man. Soon, physical culture and sport became elements of the Soviet ideological system. Concepts of eugenics in the late 1920s were sharply criticised, but this did not affect the development of sports and physical culture, which remained an important part of the Soviet sociocultural project, keeping the legacy of Soviet positive eugenics.

AB The eradication of extreme poverty in fragile states is one of the central problems of global governance at the present lime. Development of these states is hindered by instability, weak public and social institutions or ongoing conflicts and violence. The World Bank (WB) is a key partner of fragile states, which account for almost a third of the world's population.
   This article is a continuation of research exploring the evolution of conceptual and practical approaches by the World Bank to cooperation with fragile states. Its methodology is based on a multilevel analysis of the securitization of foreign aid as proposed by J. Lind and J. Howell of the London School of Economics. The main focus of this examination is on the dynamics of the change of scale and structure of the World Banks's aid to fragile states in comparison with global armed trends of providing aid to fragile states as well.
   This article concludes that statements about the priority of the Bank's work in fragile states have not yet been realized in practice. The Bank remains committed to the standard approach to working with this group of recipients, which involves serious risks. The World Bank leans toward supporting projects in fragile states which increases volatility and reduces aid predictability. This trend undermines the development perspectives of recipient states.
   Attention is drawn to political factors influencing aid flows to fragile states and particularly to the tendency of increasing the share of aid provided to fragile states through Multi-Donor Trust Funds rather than through the mechanisms of the International Development Association. This trend indicates that the Bank is no longer a central point of aid distribution to the recipients, pointing to the lack of trust of donor states in the existing mechanisms and rules of aid distribution. It also reveals the expanding role of donors' strategic interests in the process of choosing recipients of World Bank aid.

AB The article deals with the relevant issue of the influence of information space on the current state of economic security of Russian regions. In the modern society, the information space is an objectively existing phenomenon, which performs a number of constructive and destructive functions and has a direct impact on the economic security of regions. The research of Russian and foreign scientists in the field of information theory, philosophy, mathematics, economics have become the theoretical and methodological basis of the paper. Transition to the information society has changed the status of information resources. The analysis of the statistical data of authoritative Russian and foreign sources has allowed us to reveal the main tendencies of modern society. Information processes have the most significant impact on such areas as health and safety, education, science, culture, socio-political sphere, as well as the quality of life. However, threats to economic security are under transformation. Therefore, there is a need for changes in the assessment of the economic security of regions. We proposed a technique for the evaluation of economic security based on the comprehensive assessment of several groups of indicators. The number of groups and a set of estimated indicators can be defined by experts. The results of the proposed method are demonstrated on the example of eight Federal Districts of Russia. The authors used official statistics, since they covered different spheres of citizens throughout the whole state territory. The assessment includes 32 indicators distributed into nine groups: economy, food, information resources, etc. Calculations have revealed the regions with lower security level - Siberian and North-Caucasian Federal Districts. The proposed methodological approach and quantitative estimates can be used to predict and improve economic security management in regions.

The urgent need for systemic and interdisciplinary approaches is effectively implemented in the study of the history of forms of power and statecraft. One of the most promising ways to study the origins of the formation the Modem national State in the Middle Ages is presentism. It is justified by the comprehension of the State as a phenomenon of "long duration", and by the interpretation of political history as the basis of civil society and national historical memory. Special attention is drawn to the complex relationship of power and society as a new approach to the study of historical forms of ruling.

AB Prior to the 2002 electoral reform, political parties in Russia's regional legislative elections showed poor performance. Since December 2003, however, all regions have been obliged to elect no less than half of the members of their assemblies by proportional representation. As a result, party competition at the sub-national level became unavoidable. This study tests three kinds of hypotheses dealing with the institutional, sociological, and political factors in the fragmentation of party systems within Russia's regions. The analysis demonstrates that political factors, especially the activity of the Kremlin and the heads of regional executives, have played the primary role in shaping regional party systems.

AB The judicial reform of 1912, which recreated in the inner and western provinces of the Russian Empire an updated version of the magistrates' court (mirovoy sud) and liquidated the judicial functions of land captains and other judicial-administrative instances, is usually studied either in the historic-legal context or as part of political struggles of the early twentieth century. For the first time, the reform was considered in the context of managing imperial diversity and strategies of creating common institutions in conditions of heterogeneity (class, ethnic, confessional, political), both among the population of the empire as a whole and in regional and local communities. This paper addresses the state of local justice and factors that necessitated reforms, Including main positions that formed the basis for criticizing the government bill and alternative options for local courts. Positions in the discussion were related to visions of prospects and ways for integrating the Russian Empire, constructing common institutions, and nation building. The resulting model was a compromise and hybrid. A number of developed elements of local courts were in demand after the fall of the empire, even in the Soviet period.

AB The article presents the results of the analysis of publications of Russian-speaking researchers devoted to the institutional design issues. Steady and widely used in the work of English-speaking economists, representatives of institutional and neoinstitutional directions, the concept, however, is used in Russian as a rule in political science research, but not at the economic area. However, the analysis has shown that in the Russian-speaking scientific space one can find a vast layer of works in which there are points of contact between institutional, neoinstitutional theory and the theory of reforms. They develop recommendatory concepts for the selection of correct reform strategies, the implementation of which will minimize risks in the conduct of institutional reforms and maximize the possible positive effects from the introduction of new institutions. Part of the research examines the negative consequences of choosing wrong strategies for implementing reforms. This becomes the basis for several concepts, such as "institutional traps", the concept of "misuse of institutions" and institutional dissonances. All three concepts describe similar phenomena, the reason of which is the discrepancy of the institutions that are borrowed, which are implanted in the established institutional environment, provokes an increase in social costs or results in inefficient equilibrium. In conclusion, the concepts of second-best institutions and institutional corridors are considered as theoretical grounds for minimizing the negative effects of institutional design.

DT Article
DE USA; Korean War; Local Conflict; UN; USSR; PRC; Truman; Acheson; Kennan
AB The article is about the history of US involvement in the Korean War (1950-1953) in the middle of summer 1950. This problem is considered as a prototype of Washington's general approach to the organization of diplomatic support for its intervention in local conflicts. Research is based on published and unpublished documents of the diplomatic departments of the USSR and the USA, declassified CIA materials and memoirs of direct participants of the events.
   A convenient instrument for legitimizing US interference in the conflict was the UN Security Council. Washington's actions were justified by its resolutions adopted thanks to a boycott of the UN SC by the Soviet representative. At the same time, the history of local conflicts of the 20th and 21st centuries show that the US can use other rather weak excuses for military interventions.
   Along with legitimization of intervention, in the early days of the Korean War, American diplomacy worked on localization of the conflict, isolation of the theater of war, formed an UN based international coalition to participate in war, neutralized Washington's political opponents in the international arena, and coordinated assistance to Republic of Korea. The US State Department and intelligence agencies usually perform these functions in support of armed interventions in conflicts in various regions of the world today.
   The content of Washington's reaction to the situation in Korea illustrates another important feature of US foreign policy, which still remains relevant today - the rejection of any deals with violators of the US-established world order, even in the initially unfavorable military and political conditions. Washington did not refuse to negotiate a truce, but even in the conditions of catastrophic defeats of the South Korean army, a peace dialogue could be started only after the restoration of the status quo.

DE Arctic zone of Russia; development strategy; workforce; need for
   personnel; education
AB In the first quarter of the 21st century, the Arctic and everything connected with it remains a popular topic in the humanitarian, socio-economic and political spheres. It is especially relevant for Russia, which has the largest polar sector in the world. An integrated approach to the study and analysis of development prospects of the Arctic territories can create conditions for sustainable socio-economic development not only in the Arctic zone of Russia, but also in Russia as a whole. One of the elements of this approach is the need for skilled workforce at the enterprises of the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation; this topic is considered in the paper. The relevance of the topic stems from the need to implement large-scale investment projects for development of mineral resources and transport infrastructure (megaprojects), the need to address long-term tasks of socio-economic development of the Russian Arctic and ensure national security in the region. All these points are contained in the strategy for development of the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation until 2020. Statistical evaluation of demographic processes indicates a continuous outflow of population from the majority of subjects of the Arctic zone of Russia. This happens both due to natural reasons and as a result of emigration, including the emigration of working age individuals. Scientific novelty of the paper consists in its comprehensive approach: using analytical and sociological methods, we analyze the need for labor force in the real sector of the economy in the Russian Arctic. We consider the possibilities of the higher education system to meet such needs. It is established that the emigration of able-bodied population from the subjects of the Russian Arctic and the launch of megaprojects can be considered as factors in the formation of the need for labor resources in the subjects of the Arctic zone of Russia. Further scientific search in the chosen topic consists in the following points: development of methods for long-term forecasting of the needs of economic entities in labor force against the background of its outflow from the Arctic zone, additional substantiation of the medium-term need and the possibility of its implementation through higher education, and search for an alternative to corporate data on the need for workforce.

TI CONCEPTUALIZATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION IN THE FIELD OF
   SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
SO MGIMO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
LA Russian

DE international cooperation; international relations theory; science and
   technology; international information security; internet governance
AB The development of science and technology, in particular information and communication technologies, has a significant impact on world political processes. It strengthens globalization and interdependence, expands the number of actors in world politics by strengthening the capabilities of non-state actors, it transforms national sovereignty, and also leads to the emergence of new, high-tech challenges and threats to international and national security. Due to their transnational nature overcoming these challenges and threats implies cooperation between different types of actors in world politics. Multiplicity of actors, as well as the complexity, variability and pervasive nature of the subject of cooperation (technology), make traditional rationalist schools of thought not quite suitable for studying this sphere of world politics.
   On the basis of a critical review of the prevailing approaches to the study of science and technology in international relations, the author argues that the most promising theoretical school of thought in this field is social constructivism. It shows that technology is embedded in social relations, there is a constitutive relationship between technology and social structures. Therefore, the characteristics and implementation of technology can become the subject of political competition, including the international level. The spread of technology leads to the globalization of social structures and relations that are tied to them, which initially had a local origin. Naturally, this process is accompanied by political rivalry, generating resistance from agents of alternative social structures.
   As a case study to evaluate the analytical potential of this approach, the article deals with the issues of Internet governance and international information security. It is shown that since the creation of the Internet, its characteristics and governance were largely determined by the national interests of the United States, resulting in a public-private governance model in the form of ICANN. Due to the proliferation of the Internet, its technological features and characteristics of the established governance model influence policies and practices of international relations in the field of information and communication technologies. Multi-level cooperation formats have spread within the UN, bringing together representatives of states, business, civil society and the research community. First of all, it is the Internet Governance Forum created in 2006. However, such models of international cooperation do not fully correspond to the remaining statist characteristics of the modern international system, as a result they undergo adjustment. Thus, in the field of information security, non-state actors have only consulting powers, while the key format of interaction remains intergovernmental cooperation. It seems that the global regime of Internet governance is developing in this direction.

DE Immanuel Kant; categorical imperative; universalizability principle;
   formula of universal law; formula of law of nature
AB Two formulas of the universalizability principle of the categorical imperative - the formula of universal law and the formula of the law of nature - have been regularly interpreted in general philosophical literature as mutually specifying each other. The former one has been considered as representing the character of normativity peculiar to the categorical imperative, the latter one its ontological status. The law of nature has been interpreted as a physical law or as a "natural law" in the spirit of the natural law tradition. Not all commentators of Kant have taken into account his note on the concept of nature as an order of actions determined by laws. The issue of two versions of the universalizability principle, their interrelation, and functional and substantial peculiarities is important for understanding both the principle of universalizability and the concept of the categorical imperative. Taking into consideration the significance of the principle as a criterion of moral worth in Kant's ethics and the influence of this aspect of Kant's teaching on the succeeding moral philosophy, the issue of relation between two versions of the universalizability principle should be recognized as an important one for general discussion on the nature of morality. Following the critical-comparative analysis of discussion on this issue in Kant studies (A.P. Skripnik, E.Yu. Soloviev, A.K. Sudakov, H.J. Paton, A.W. Wood), the author points to the significance of analogy between moral law and the law of nature in Kant's doctrine, to the inner connection between formal and material features of the categorical imperative, and to the place of teleological component in Kant's moral philosophy. The latter puts forward the task of rethinking of the common understanding of Kant's ethics as exclusively formal and the first formula of the categorical imperative as the 'standard' one.

DE Grigory Potanin; Siberia; Frederick Turner; Queen Elizabeth II
AB The paper focuses on the mechanisms by which the image of an eminent explorer of Siberia and Central Asia, Grigory Potanin, was institutionalized in the public consciousness of Siberians at the turn of the 19th century, and discusses the transmission of this image to the following generations as a public value. The hero phenomenon is treated from a temporal and topological point of view. The significance of Potanin's work is explained by the fact that the issues he put on the agenda in modern times are gaining more attention in the post-modern era, and the ideas that he voiced pose unsolved problems that are taken on by new generations of scholars. The mechanisms of institutionalizing the image of Potanin in the public consciousness of the late Soviet and post-Soviet eras were the protest against the ideological markers and stigmas of the Soviet era, the concern to honor the great scholar and the intensification in the regional critical thought both on the part of the population and the state institutions in Siberia. The work of Potanin is contrasted against the work of Frederick Turner, an American scientist who at the same time advanced his "Frontier Thesis". Siberia, as a frontier, formed Potanin's culture, which manifested itself in his scientific, public and publishing endeavors. The scholar's image was further fixed in the Siberian public consciousness by the circle of his allies and supporters. Another event that helped to institutionalize the image of this great personality, the first Distinguished Citizen of Siberia, was the reburial of his remains. Potanin's story incorporated both the Soviet features of preserving memories of outstanding persons and a certain mythology - the alleged role Queen Elizabeth II played in maintaining Potanin's grave. The paper concludes that a number of circumstances now uphold the image of Potanin in Siberians' public consciousness: the development of the Trans-Ural territory, the unwavering enthusiasm of scholars and journalists directed towards Potanin's personality, the perpetuation of his memory in street names in Russia and Kazakhstan, and the location of the "Siberian partriarch's" grave in the grove of Tomsk State University.

DE Gogol; Shevchenko; Slavic world; liberal discourse; Tomsk; M.A. Reisner;
   I.A. Malinovsky; honouring the memory
AB In this article the Siberian periodicals are used to examine the mutual influence of educational activities of law professors of Imperial Tomsk University (M.A. Reisner and I.A. Malinovsky) during the honouring of the memory of N.V. Gogol and T. Shevchenko and the political identity of liberal intelligentsia in the early 20th century. The national celebrations of Gogol's anniversaries in 1902 and 1909 included a number of events in Tomsk. "Shevchenko's evenings", dedicated to the 40th anniversary of the poet's death and the abolition of serfdom in Russia also played a prominent role in the city's public life. The educational representation of writers' images in Reisner's and Malinovsky's lectures and public speeches were of atranstemporal character, i.e. the problems of modernity were discussed in the historical perspective. An important trend of this process was the merging of ethnic and political discourses, when the struggle of the "younger brother" for national independence was identified with the struggle for civil freedom. Speaking about the category of law, the professor used the metaphor "soil". The interpretation of writers' biographies and works as well as the historical context were of selective nature. On the one hand, this entailed a number of contradictions between the proclamation of Gogol as a "fighter for the liberation movement" and the content of his works and personal position. On the other hand, this historical technology resulted in the appearance of the two writers on the liberal discourse symbolic map of Russian intelligentsia.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE Canada; Ukrainian crisis; Ukrainian Canadian Congress; sanctions; NATO;
   Canada's foreign policy
AB Canada's attitude to the events in Ukraine in 2013-2018 is determined by two factors: general solidarity with western countries and the presence of a large Ukrainian diaspora there. Initially (November 2013-February 2014), Canada viewed the Ukrainian crisis as an internal political one. However, after the entry of Crimea into Russia, Ottawa began to consider the crisis as international, as a confrontation between Russia and the West. It began to impose the first sanctions against Russia after the Crimean referendum. Primarily, these sanctions were rather limited, but after the beginning of full-scale hostilities in the east of Ukraine in the summer-autumn of 2014, Canada began to introduce sectoral sanctions. Ottawa's active participation in various programs of military assistance to Kiev reflects not only solidarity with other member countries of NATO. The Ukrainian diaspora represented by its chief lobby-the Ukrainian Canadian Congress-forces the Canadian government to act more actively in Ukraine, including the military sphere. Military assistance to Kiev is in the context of Ottawa's support of Ukraine's membership in NATO. On the other hand, it is often necessary to separate the real Canadian aid to Ukraine from the "grandstanding". For example, the discussion in Canada about participation in a possible UN peacekeeping operation in Ukraine was initiated by the Conservative Party primarily as an opportunity to weaken their political opponents-the ruling Liberal Party in the run-up to the parliamentary elections of 2019. The conservatives'proposal for a UN peacekeeping operation contained elements that made it impossible for Russia to accept this proposal. Canadian military assistance to Ukraine is becoming more and more significant and diverse. Ottawa is ready to supply lethal weapons to Kiev. In spite of it, Canada reluctantly agreed to deploy its troops in Latvia. Ottawa took this step not because of the NATO's request, but under U.S. pressure.

DE Catalonia; conceptual history; democracy; freedom; historicity; rights;
   self-determination; Spain
AB Reinhart Koselleck showed that the decades around 1800 witnessed a major transformation of political language. Around 1800, the horizon of expectations gained distance from the space of the experiences that human beings were making, and thus possibilities for the future opened up widely. In particular, the future would be the time during which 'peoples' would gain their capacity for self-determination, called popular sovereignty. This would occur in two particular versions that crystallized in the course of the 19th century, namely as 'nations' that would unify or liberate themselves from monarchical and/or imperial domination to form the polities proper to them, or as a 'class' that embodied the universal interest of humankind and would assert itself in a second revolution, following up on the French Revolution. Political concepts acquired during that period the meaning that they still had in the late 20th century, i.e. the time when Koselleck developed his approach to the history of concepts, but they may be challenged in the present time, and with them the entire self-understanding of modern polities. The recent Catalan conflict serves to better understand this challenge. 'People' and 'nation' are there used in ways that are reminiscent of this politico-conceptual tradition, but in a highly ambiguous way. On the one hand, they are employed in exactly their historical meaning: the Catalan people and nation are seen to be finally fulfilling their historical role of reaching political self-determination. On the other hand, these concepts are re-deployed to place them in the current context of existing democratic commitments and institutions as well as high interdependence between polities, all the while claiming that Catalan independence opens up a new normative horizon of democracy, rights, and freedom. This article will try to show that this undeclared ambiguity is characteristic of our current situation in general. This is a situation in which the historically created political concepts have sedimented in institutions, and thus appear to have 'consolidated' and moved beyond their historicity. At the same time, they remain impregnated with particular historical experiences that can be re-interpreted to be mobilized in political struggles of the present. To assess the validity and acceptability of any such re-interpretation requires explicit reflection about the persistence of historicity in political concepts.

AB The Institute of Geography, Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS), was founded in Petrograd in 1918 as the Industrial-Geographical Department of the Commission for Studying Natural Production Forces. In 1934, it was moved to Moscow and renamed the Institute of Physical Geography of the USSR Academy of Sciences and then (in 1936) the Institute of Geography of the USSR Academy of Sciences. Its history included all stages of the development of the national geography, beginning from the traditions of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when the concept of geography as a descriptive science was given up and its branch specialization began, until the formation of geography of the 21st century as a paradigm and synthetic discipline with great prospects for developing knowledge. The modern geography and the Institute of Geography of the Russian Academy of Sciences use a wide range of interdisciplinary remote and field methods, the latest tools, and laboratory analyses to understand the quickly changing world, its nature, the population, and the economy retrospectively, at the present time, and in the future. The results of the research performed at the Institute was published in the Vestnik RAS periodical many times.

DT Article
DE elections in 2016 and 2018; United Russia; CPRF; LDPR; correlation;
   region; macro-region; potential increase or decrease in support for
   party
AB The article examines the correlation of election results in the State Duma in 2016 (per cent of voters who supported each of the three main parties) at the level of the regions (subjects of the Russian Federation) with three indicators. The article includes three sections, each of which, in turn, examines these indicators. The first indicator is socio-economic phenomena at the regional level. The second indicator is the results of the same elections at the level of the macro-regions to which the respective regions belong. The third indicator is socio-economic phenomena at the level of macro-regions to which the respective regions belong. Taking into account these correlations, four types of regions are established for each indicator. If the region in fact supported a certain party in the elections to the Duma of 2016 (this party received more votes here than the national average), and, at the same time, had support factors for this party, more than the national average, this was a region of sustained support for this party (support factors in this and other types can characterize both the region directly and the macro-region to which the region belongs). If the region gave fewer votes for this party than the national average and had less support for this party than the national average, this was a region of steadily low support for this party. If the region gave this party more votes than the national average, but had fewer support factors, this was a region of potential reduction of support for this party. If the region gave the party fewer votes than the national average, but had a relatively strong range of support factors for this party, this was a region of potential increase in support for this party. The greatest attention in the pre-election struggle should be drawn by the regions of potential increase and potential reduction in support for a particular party. All three indicators and types are considered complementary to each other when predicting the electoral behavior of the population of the region.

AB The article offers a criticism of the historical-epistemological approach of Olga Stoliarova. Some arguments are proposed that can break the circle of self-justification, into which epistemology eventually falls: every philosophical ontology is justified epistemologically, and the language of epistemological concepts is already prefaced with some ontology (otherwise concepts would be introduced as meaningless). It is claimed that Stoliarova argues with the constructivist approach, according to which everything that is postulated as existing is a consequence of observation (= application of an apparatus of distinctions). Thus, the assertion that something exists is a consequence of the distinction between being and non-being, and hence this ontological judgment is secondary to the epistemological statement about how and by what observational distinctions this observation is made. And in this case should a philosophizing historian of science declare the limitation of his scientific interest to the area of epistemology, and should any claim to ontological assertion be regarded as unjustified? Not at all. On the contrary, such a historian of science now sees a whole network of realisms created by scientists. It is claimed that ontological judgments are the fate of scientific observers, who (each from their observational perspectives) formulate their regional ontology.

DE consciousness; physicalism; antiphysicalism; supervenience; David
   Chalmers; additional and positive facts
AB An urgent task of modern philosophy is the interpretation of the ontological status of consciousness in the physicalism and antiphysicalism opposition. Physicalism postulates the possibility to explain the phenomena of consciousness through the concepts of the physical world; antiphysicalism denies this. The most discussed antiphysicalism project in the present-day theory of consciousness is the naturalistic dualism, or dualism of properties. Naturalistic dualism states a holistic causal closed world, represented by non-reducible physical and non-physical properties in which consciousness shall be given the status of a fundamental property of the universum that is not reducible to physical properties. Thus, a presumption about the psychophysical nature of reality is formulated, and the need to review the physicalistic doctrine given the possibility of non-reductive explanation of mental experience is stated. A concrete example of naturalistic dualism in the contemporary philosophy of mind is David Chalmers' theory. In his work The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory ( 1996), Chalmers comes to a conclusion that the facts of consciousness are associated with the physical world, but they are not reducible to them. Our understanding of the essence of matter requires a fundamental revision. The argument about the representability and logical possibility of the world without conscious experience is given as defending this thesis; therefore, an assumption is made that consciousness in our world has a supermaterial nature. This article analyzes the formal, conceptual-ontological and language contradictions in Chalmers' theory of consciousness. The idea of the supermaterial supervenient nature of consciousness has been criticized, and it is stated that the factual statement of the qualitative content of experience is impossible. In summary, a conclusion is made that antiphysicalism in the philosophy of consciousness contradicts itself.

DE event; historical event; simulacrum; eventless history; postmodernism
AB The article reviews the problems of changes in the understanding of historical events and eventless history in postmodernism. Changes were already outlined in the framework of modernism and were based on the notion that a historical event is "separated" from reality and it is, first of all, a construction of the subject. Changes were also based on the idea of the historical process that cannot be made up of events exclusively. Events only indicate changes and act as measurement milestones. Therefore, there must be something in the historical process that is not an event. In the researchers' attention was the so-called "eventless history" which in modernism was an alternation within the norms and traditions, the opposite of "eventful" history. In postmodernism, eventless history has a completely different form. Simulacra are eventless history, they can look like events, possess their properties, but they are not events. Simulacrum events do not oppose historical events, but tend to take their place and even "become" them. With outer resemblance to events, simulacrum events occur on the surface and create the illusion of change and movement. Unlike historical events, they do not pursue the goal of finding the truth, their goal is adaptability to anything. This means that simulacra precede a real event, and models predetermine a real fact. In history, the present precedes the past: in the present, events of the past can be "canceled", estimates can be changed, etc. Events, therefore, are created in the present and are transformed into the past. Historical events are "adjusted" to the desired result, which can be the embodiment of the dominant ideology. In this case, it is not the search for meaning of an event that is carried out, but fact-finding and event-designing in order to implement the already given meaning. An event whose meaning is predetermined does not need to be fixed in space and time, in concreteness and uniqueness. A feature of historical research is the search for information; more information helps to reveal the deep layers of meaning. But the modern flow of information consists of a large number of copies and simulacra, which leads to the opposite situation - an increase in the amount of information entails a reduction of meaning. This flow of information is partly the result of the activities of the media, which are at the same time a type of historical sources. A feature of the functioning of the media is the same status of events, which makes it difficult to separate real events and simulacra.

AB The pivot to the Asia-Pacific region is Russia's strategic response to existential challenges such as the threat of losing great power status, and the need to maintain territorial integrity and independence. This strategy should not be viewed as meant only to ameliorate the economic and demographic situation in the Russian Far East and Eastern Siberia. Instead, it should be interpreted as an opportunity for Russia to break out of the economic, security, and geographic traps she finds herself in within the Western-dominated international order. The emerging Asia-Pacific regional order may develop into a new international order that will be more competitive; it will not be dominated by a single power or ideology but will instead rest on multiple centers of power. This order will be more favorable to Russia than the unipolar Atlantic one, helping Russia utilize her comparative advantages in territory, resources, hard power, political organization, and ability to mobilize resources for strategic goals.

AB The problem posed by Olga Stoliarova in her article is particularly relevant in the context of a heightened confrontation between the supporters of "scientific realism" and those who criticize the naive or metaphysical realism and contrasts it with socio-constructivist and socio-epistemological approaches. A justification of the autonomy of historical ontology, its "parallelism" with historical epistemology is designed to give arguments in favor of the priority and self-worth of "ontological intuitions". And here historical ontologism finds itself facing the already known issue of incomprehensibility of reality in itself, and the inability to talk about reality outside a definite - either scientific or non-scientific - language. Scientific language is the language of various kinds of theories: all terms acquire meanings through involvement in some conceptual system. The difference between theories gives rise to the problem of conceptual incommensurability, which can hardly be resolved by appealing to ontological intuitions of a non-scientific character. Indeed, in this case historical ontology in search of a justification for the unity of scientific knowledge goes far beyond the latter and replaces "conceptual irrationalism" by a mystical faith in the transcendent. And it is not the result that would satisfy scientific realists or the proponents of Bruno Latour who inspired the "ontological turn".

AB The article attempts a critical analysis of Olga Stoliarova's discussion of historical epistemology and historical ontology. It is shown that the so-called historical epistemology is a traditional theory of knowledge that takes into account the results of epistemological conceptions proposed by the thinkers of the past. As far as historical ontology is concerned, the meaning of this term remains unclear. It is argued that the main value of Stoliarova's paper is that it clearly states that well-known philosophical problems are currently discussed in the European and Anglo-American philosophy. In most cases, foreign writers mean to give something new to philosophy when they introduce new terms. However, it is often easy to recognize old and well-known problems of philosophy behind all these new words.

AB The article discusses one example of contemporary historiographic discourse: the concept of the Scientific Revolution as an event associated with the formation of the foundations of science in the writings of scholars and philosophers of the 16th-18th centuries. The first part of the article demonstrates that one of the significant controversies of contemporary historiography is expressed in the ambiguous representation of the structure of the Scientific Revolution. The beginning of the revolution is interpreted as a break with the past, on the one hand, and as its renewal, on the other. The author briefly describes the stages of the revolution presented in these two interpretations. The second part discusses some conditions of the complementarity of these two interpretations of the structure of the Scientific Revolution. On the basis of this complementarity, the author reveals a kind of an "innovation lesson" that contemporary historiography gives to the philosophical research of science. The author of the article pursues two intentions. The first methodological intention refers to actual discussions on the interaction of history and the philosophy of science, and tries to confirm the hypothesis that history is important because it not only fills certain theses with content for philosophical studies of science, but also participates in joint work on a possible response to the challenges of modernity. The author recognizes the question of the emergence of innovations in science as one of such serious challenges. The second meaningful intention appeals to the ambiguity of the image of the Scientific Revolution created by the contemporary historiography of science from the end of the 20th to the beginning of the 21st century. This image problematizes the answer of the philosophy of science to the questions connected with the emergence of the new European science, with the formation of new knowledge. The analysis of this image allows formulating a set of conditions for the emergence of innovations in science.

AB The article discusses the epistemological interconnections of such concepts as the right to the city, mobile citizenship, urban mobility and universal design. The problem of accessibility of and barriers in the urban environment has become extremely important today for the researchers, since it is directly related to the issues of the quality of life, overcoming the marginalization of millions of ordinary Russian citizens. The authors emphasise that universal design is becoming a key condition for improving the accessibility of the environment, public goods and services for all people. The right to the city is considered in terms of freedom of movement, accessibility of socially significant objects, including urban green areas, as well as in the perspective of mobilizing a civic position. The mobile citizenship of such vulnerable groups as people with disabilities, migrants, women and other categories of population, is associated with their right to accessible city routes and inclusive parks. Focus on the accessibility of urban green spaces reveals the growing complexity of urban life. The problems of equal access of people to safe and inclusive urban green spaces are presented here on the basis of the materials of the World Health Organization and empirical data obtained through walk along. It is shown that the turn to the new urbanism caused the emergence of the walk along method in such a theoretical perspective that considers the right to the city in the process of interaction of city authorities, designers, architects, builders and ordinary people, old-timers and newcomers, everyday users who make changes in cities. The cognitive potential of the walk along interview method is shown not only in the context of social sciences. Its applicability in urban planning is also emphasized. As the interviews showed, social citizenship is faced with obstacles in practice, and one should think about factors that facilitate orientation, mobility, security, improving the accessibility of urban space.

DE Arctic; Russia; security; military-political environment; military
   postures; continental shelf
AB Despite the current crisis in relations between Russia and the West, the Arctic agenda remains cooperative and constructive. There are numerous examples of progress in regional cooperation over the past few years achieved not least due to cooperation between Russia and the U.S. However, one should not take it for granted that the region can remain immune to the effects of wider politics indefinitely. The longer the current confrontation between Russia and the West persists, the more likely the space of cooperation in the Arctic would begin shrinking rather than further growing. There already are visible signs that the situation can aggravate in the not-so-distant prospective. A sense of increasing political uncertainty spreads among the Arctic countries. This pertains specifically to prospects of a cooperative management of overlapping claims over the continental shelf in the central Arctic Ocean. Particularly in Denmark, concerns are raised that Russia may abandon its previous commitments in that regard and, instead, turn to unilateral action in order to maximize its portion of the shelf through the North Pole. The Russian military build-up, although so far seen as non-threatening by the defence establishment of other Arctic states, also raises concerns as the focus increasingly shifts from assessing Russian intentions towards its capabilities. The suspension of military-political cooperation with Russia in the Arctic does not only arrest the formation of an inclusive security architecture but cements old division lines. Worst case scenarios project spill-over effects from eventual Russia-West confrontation in the Baltics or in the North Atlantic into the Arctic. The danger of unintended escalation of such developments should inform the Arctic countries to take urgent steps in order to arrest further securitization of the region and increase the predictability of their policies and conventional postures there.

AB In this article we investigate the characteristic features of political communication in the Republic of South Ossetia. Strategies and tactics for carrying on a political discourse will be examined with the material of press conferences and interviews of south Ossetian politicians, and the methods of their verbalization are considered. Investigation in this area is carried out for the first time, as the discursive analysis and systemic account of south Ossetian political communication is one of the most important and problematic issues within South Ossetian linguistics. In the present article speech strategies and tactics of key political leaders, in particular, the President and the speaker of the parliament of the Republic of South Ossetia and methods of their language realization are dealt with. The basic purpose of the investigation is the disclosure of peculiarities of functioning of political communication in the Republic of South Ossetia. The main method of investigation is discursive-cognitive analysis. Tactic-strategic store of the President and the speaker of the parliament serve for realizing the discourse of power and nation. Unity of the political course of the leaders of the country is manifested by use of dominating strategies-unity, openness/transparency and feedback. Role self-presentation of the representatives of the two branches of the government is sustained in the framework of Ossetic cultural tradition, in accordance with which the President of the Republic of South Ossetia is "the senior" and the speaker is "the junior".

LA Russian
DT Article
DE international development assistance; development aid; European Union;
   post-Soviet space; foreign policy
AB The article presents analysis of the development assistance machinery used by the European Union, and its application to the post-Soviet space. The EU makes its "Global Strategy" the basis for application of various foreign policy tools, including the tool of foreign aid. Much of the EU effort in the field is based on two pillars - the Sustainable Development Goals, as formulated in the United Nations, and the EU's key value priorities - support for democracy and human rights. While the European External Action Service does add up to the EU's foreign policy coherence, the development aid and humanitarian assistance are run by separate EU agencies, which allows to take into account the specificity of this policy field. When the European Union institutions and member states are treated as a unified official development aid provider, it makes sense, since the member states share the key priorities in the field and make use of coordination in the EU. Ukraine is much more than a foreign aid recipient for the European Union. As a result of the political crisis that creates troubles for the country since 2014, the EU does feel the necessity to provide diverse support to Ukraine, though it stops short of agreeing to Ukraine's candidacy for membership in the Union. In this context foreign aid becomes one of the tools that help to resolve some of Ukraine's acute problems. Central Asia is much less of a priority for the European Union, although the opportunities which can open for the EU's presence through foreign aid are carefully explored. The approach to Central Asian countries varies greatly. Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan as the most vulnerable remain the recipients of conventional sorts of assistance, while Kazakhstan is ready for a much more equal partnership, thus, showing the way to others. While the EU's approach to the post-Soviet space will be ever more differentiated, depending on the partners' development and readiness to build advanced relations, foreign aid will remain among the EU's notable foreign policy instruments, albeit far from being the only one.

DE Big Data; digital inequality; political control; digital framing
AB In the conditions of active introduction of a wide range of digital technologies, including Big Data technologies, into the space of contemporary politics, the technological potential is formed, acting as a powerful factor of influence on traditional political processes. In this regard, the aim of the work is to analyse this potential, as well as to identify the potential risks, threats and challenges associated with the application of Big Data technologies in contemporary politics. Using the scenario approach, key challenges and threats are highlighted in the article, such as digital inequality and the emergence of data-classes that have different capabilities for accessing and using digital arrays of data. Another threat is the formation of technological regimes capable of performing total digital control over citizens through the using of individual digital traces. At the same time, not only state structures but also global corporations can be interested in creating such regimes. Also, the work identifies such a significant threat as the formation of personal digital frames and value-semantic capsules that have the ability, based on the subjective features of the perception of individuals, to limit ideas about the socio-political reality of citizens, cutting them off from reality. When implementing such a scenario, individuals will receive only ready-made explanatory models adapted to their subjective preferences and expectations but limited both in the aspect of illuminating only a specific range of events, phenomena and processes and in the aspect of their "correct" interpretation containing specific value-semantic components. Based on the results of the study, it is concluded that Big Data technologies have both constructive and negative potential in terms of influencing the processes of social and political development. At the same time, the primary vectors of application of contemporary technologies for working with digital data sets as well as the balance of interests of various actors of socio-political processes will be formed in real political practice.

AB The article deals with intensive discussions on the principles of MEPs election and nomination of the European Commission's President, which take place in two major EU institutions - European Council and Parliament. The author focuses on analysis of the most controversial initiatives - nomination of a Spitzenkandidat and the MEP's "transnational lists". Based on the debates in the European Council and the European Parliament, as well as on the EU Commission proposals, the author examines the positions of various political actors who will participate in the elections and influence the appointment of EU leaders. The author concludes that the Spitzenkandidat process is considered by the main pro-European parties and the EU leaders to be an instrument for the exclusion of influence of eurosceptics and redical groups. On the other hand, the tensions between the EU institutions, which go beyond the electoral process itself, give extra trump cards to eurosceptics and critics of European integration.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE Russia; Latin America; Argentina; trade; economic cooperation; strategic
   partnership
AB In a changing world order, some emerging factors are objectively conductive to Russia's rapprochement with those regions that relatively recently (15-20 years ago) were mainly in the sphere of other global actors' interests. In particular, in recent years, Russia had a kind of breakthrough with Latin America and the Caribbean: a significant advance towards bilateral and multilateral interaction almost in all possible formats and on all fronts. An example is the Russian-Argentine cooperation. At the present stage, relations between the Russian Federation and the Argentine Republic are characterized by strategic depth, and cover a wide range of priority areas of interstate economic and political interactions. The root causes for this state of affairs reflect both specifics of the comparatively long historical experience of the Russian-Argentine cooperation and peculiarities of the current very difficult and largely controversial period of world development, the main feature of which are rapid changes in all spheres of international life. The modern period of bilateral relations can be divided in three different content segments. During the first stage (until 2007), a process of gradual rapprochement took place. At that time, the most promising spheres of economic and political cooperation were defined. In subsequent years, a significant expansion of bilateral interaction associated with Russia's new foreign policy concept dated July 12, 2008 was noted, encompassing Latin American countries in the scope of Moscow's priority interests. At the same time, a personal understanding between the leaders of Russia and Argentina was reached. In the second phase (2008-2014), bilateral relations reached a new level. Having agreed in 2008 to build the relations of strategic partnership, Russian and Argentine governments made vigorous efforts to translate these mutual intentions into practice. An unprecedented intensification of political and diplomatic contacts occurred, a number of visits between senior leaders took place that permitted to establish the relationship of mutual understanding and trust. Both sides demonstrated a willingness for long and wide cooperation. The current, third phase of interaction began, according to the authors, in 2015, when Argentine-Russian relations reached their highest point by transition to the stage of comprehensive strategic partnership. However, holding on to reality, it is necessary to note that Argentina and Russia are still at the very beginning of the path to maximizing benefits from collaboration in various sectors of economy.

AB This article presents an analysis of regional inter-ethnic relations: it describes a study conducted on the basis of deep semi-formalised interviews with foreign students from near and far abroad who study in Tomsk universities. The relevance of the topic is implied by the multinationality of Russian regions, the balanced development of which is possible only in the context of inter-ethnic harmony and the increasing flows of labour and education migration to Russia. Various factors such as politics, economy, demography and social culture can influence the tolerance of the society and initiate some conflict situations. Education migration is a new trend in the system of Russian university education. The number of international students in Russia is rising constantly. This publication includes the analysis of relations between education migrants and local people. The article is based on the results of a sociological survey conducted in June - October 2017 in Tomsk State Pedagogical University. Participants of the study gave their opinion on the current situation and their assessment to it, which helped the authors of the article to find out some misunderstandings between people. The study was conducted in Tomsk State Pedagogical University and Tomsk State University. About twenty international students were interviewed to identify negative and positive factors in inter-ethnic relations. According to the results, negative factors did not appear systematically. A lot of problems were connected with the new unknown language and cultural differences, the educational equality between Russian and international students was unbalanced as well. The students from Central Asia felt that they were assessed more negatively than non-CIS students. Most migrants suppose that friendship with the local society exists, but in real situations migrants were at a distance from the citizens. People from Central Asia communicated with other diasporas, but this communication was quite limited and covered only national holidays. People from the same ethnic groups were helping each other. The obtained data allow pointing out factors which can influence inter-ethnic relations and education migrant adaptation, they also help to offer corrective measures in education migrant adaptation strategies.

DE epistemology; constructivism; realism; evolutionary constructivism
AB The paper focuses on the analysis of constructivism in the philosophical theory of cognition. Constructivism as a cognitive practice states an active cognitive position of the subject who perceives by transforming, creating and constructing the environment. A constructivist approach in epistemology was initiated by Immanuel Kant. Foregrounding of constructivism was conditioned by addressing to the cognition of complex self-developing systems. Contemporary constructivism in a variety of its forms differs from classical by denial of existence of a predetermined phenomenon for the conscience. The most acknowledged forms of contemporary constructivism are radical and social constructivism. Radical constructivism deliberately dissociates itself from metaphysical reflections about existence and regards cognition as a self-consistent process. The central problem of radical constructivism is not the substantiation of knowledge, not the reflection on what we cognize (knowledge of "what"), but the research of the process of cognition (knowledge of "how"). For followers of social constructivism, scientific knowledge is socially constructed. Herewith, knowledge ceases to be an individual property, but becomes a product of the activities of members of society. Radical constructivism, in its naturalistic and social versions, is opposed to the approach of constructive realism. It is revealed that constructive realism is a complex program of cognition research. The authors of the paper suggest a model of evolutionary constructivism. Evolutionary constructivism is based on the principles of realism, and proceeds from the fact that thinking does not reveal objects, but constructs them, extracting from reality what correlates with its activities. With such an approach, the circle "the world is in the brain, and the brain is in the world" transforms into an evolutionary spiral. According to evolutionary constructivism, there is no de-ontologization of reality; reality is interpreted as a process-system. The subject is understood as a permanently self-determined integrity in the process of a communicative action, characterized by physiological, biological, social, cognitive and ethical parameters. Cognition within evolutionary constructivism can be called complexity cognition. This kind of complexity is engendered by the subject who realizes oneself not only as a part, but as a participant in the evolution of the world one cognizes, as the one who constructs this world with one's projective and communicative activity.

AB The article examines how the educational activities of the university changes in the conditions of changing the type of culture. The Enlightenment culture cultivates the right idea (about the world, the purpose of a person, etc.) which gets its expression in the printed text, the Gutenberg galaxy. The Humboldt-type university corresponds to this culture, it crowned the system of education built on the principles of a class-and-lesson structure, where the "class/course/academic degree" indicated the level of education, and the "lesson/department/faculty" indicated the content of the transferred knowledge. The Humboldt university coped well with its functions as long as culture remained a culture of representation (the essence of truth, ideal and necessity), but it began to malfunction when the type of culture changed. Modern culture is a mosaic culture; it is a culture of dialogue in which each voice proclaims its truth; it is a culture of new rationality, including the chance (aleatory culture); it is a culture of affirming the value of the individual principle and the significance of the action a recentiori (depending on a situation). Modern culture is the culture of presence rather than representation; a symbol of its acts is not a printed book, but a book of persons - Facebook, the Zuckerberg galaxy. The Zuckerberg galaxy and the information society demonstrate the diversity and personal meaning of information. The distinction between meaning and sense, thought and knowledge was exposed, and thus the university faced the need to change its pedagogical orientation - to teach the ability to work with diverse information, to teach to think, not to teach knowledge, to teach to understand (the logic of sense), not to teach thinking. Modern culture based on the network logic of the information society needs a different type of university. The educational space of the modern university is divided into two parts: (1) the traditional lecture hall space, and (2) the network information space. The logic of the action of the modern university should be determined by familiarizing students to the event of thought, to the logic of sense and to the experience of freedom.

AB The aim of the paper is to see how the change of discourse on globalization might enlighten the formation of a new ontology of world order. The main methods of the authors' analysis are connected with the interdisciplinary approach to globalization, comparative studies, philosophical analysis of globalization. During the investigation of globalization issues within sciences like economics, international relations, social sciences, sociology, political sciences, legal sciences, philosophy, the authors came to the following conclusions: 1. The first period of globalization issues in the 1990s is connected with the interdisciplinary analysis of globalization in various sciences: economic, political, social, etc. Globalization was rather a neglected topic in philosophy in this period. The analysis of globalization issues shows that theoretical debates in this period have different appraisals: from negative assessment of globalization to fascination for globalization. In most recent theoretical debates, two trends of investigation of this process arise: globalization on the basis of the idea of progress which leads to a homogeneous world (universalism), and globalization on the basis of representation of the world's real diversity (multiculturalism). Analysis of the main concepts of globalization provides the basis for the authors' classification of interpretations of globalization: historical concepts, economical concepts, social concepts, political concepts, legal concepts. The authors' conclusion is that the first period of discourse on globalization represents fragmentary comprehension of globalization. 2. The authors identified the second period of globalization analysis which is concerned with the philosophical analysis of contemporary network globalization. Global network organizations are a new type of a network structure based on the network of political institutions and on the network of international, national, local institutions of decision making. Individualization and decentralization are opposite to the socialization of work, vertical integration, big production which characterized industrial society's hierarchical forms of organization and interaction. Contemporary network organizations guarantee the flexibility of firms, individuals, countries in the conditions of globalization. The global network society phenomenon represents not only a new type of a network organization, but a new ontology of world order, transforming the present ideas of the reality. In the authors' opinion, this creates the opportunity for the formation of a new philosophical thinking - thinking without the subject, based on the analysis of network representation of the reality. Network globalization concepts open new perspectives for the philosophical analysis of globalization as a new ontology of world order.

DE science; Modern Age; search for truth; technological progress; humanism
AB The author discusses the problem of the origins of natural sciences as well as the problem of their usefulness. He argues that there is a widespread belief in philosophy of science that science is a sphere of human activity which aims at producing objectively true knowledge. Search for truth appears to be the main purpose of science. He claims that this belief remains naive or even misleading. Science as one of social institutions also aims at carrying out some socially determined functions. Yet the most important function here is not the search for truth but technical development. The author argues that the search for truth represents an instrument for technical progress solely. The great geographical discoveries resulted in the European political expansion and gold enrichment. The development of shipbuilding, the rise of markets and infrastructure became the consequences of this process. The author notes that the first scientists (Leonardo, Niccolo Tartaglia) were at the same time great inventors. This fact shows that the Modern Age science primarily appears to be technoscience. The rise of experiment as a key method of science also revealed a close connection between science and technology. The author shows that the Modern Age science development has resulted in the technological improvement of human labor and communication. He claims that the Modern Age science has created an artificial world, which we now call "civilized". It has really contributed to the total satisfaction of our biological needs, but it has failed in the improvement of our spiritual life. However, religion, arts, philosophy and even mythology have always been dealing with this. The author concludes that these spheres have played a major role in the spiritual growth of the humanity.

DE care of the self; education; myth; identity
AB The article examines some aspects of the formation of the performative identity of the participants in the process of education (teacher and student) as a practice of care of the self. In performative theories the concept of identity is associated with the subject's actions which contribute to the production of new relation types (physical, mental, social, ethical, existential) and determine belonging to it. The practice of care of the self is considered in dynamics - from concept to myth as a syncretic unity of various dimensions of care. In the real modern educational practice, care of the self demands an approach of mutual openness, interactivity and conformity of borders of care between the teacher and the student. The teacher should care about the non-dogmatic perception of algorithms or "knowledge-skills-experience" by the student. The teacher should make sure the student understands semantics and sense as an event and experience, as an existential adventure rather than simply reproduces some syntax. Performative identity as a permanently continuing process of transformation of the "image of the self", as it was mentioned above, is like a fluid, paradoxical (non-)identity that should be created only in the context of mutual care: docendo discimus - we learn by teaching. This kind of educational practice demands openness to the Other, decentration, interactivity and "risky thinking" as its principles.

AB UK-Russia relations are going through a new phase of deterioration. The article analyses the position of key political figures of the British Cabinet as participants of the anti-Russian multifaceted campaign aimed at supporting the Tory government inside the country and in its Brexit negotiations with Brussels. Another goal is to establish Britain as a leader of the anti-Russian international front. The UK has intentionally politicized the Salisbury incident and accused Russia of the use of force (a military-grade chemical agent) on the UK territory. London called its NATO and the EU allies to express solidarity. In parallel, the US, the UK and France, having accused Damascus of using chemical weapons and Russia as its baker, launched airstrikes against Syria. Through a series of provocations the West attempts to question the veto power of Russia in the UN SC and to isolate it on the international stage.

AB The article analyzes basic features of two ideological systems. Their confrontation becomes more evident in the modern western society, especially in European countries. The authors underline the ideology of "new liberalism" with its principles of the political correctness, pluralism, priority of the rights of minorities in the society. This ideology is defined as universalism. This ideological system is confronted by traditionalism or identism that based on the recognition of the values of the traditional family, national peculiarity, the state sovereignty (and connected with it patriotism) and the significance of the role of religion in the modern society and politics. The essence of two worldviews and the character of the political and cultural conflict between them is analyzed on the ground of the sociological survey (by Pew Research Center) on the religious belonging and national identity in Europe. The attitude to religious identity is the best way to demonstrates differences in worldviews. The article emphasizes the idea that the frontiers of two ideologies are blurred. The conclusion is drawn that crystallization of the two ideological camps is a matter of time.

AB The article analyzes peculiarities of the current stage of party-political transformations in Western Europe, characterizes its difference from the previous period of changes in the political landscape of the region, and assesses possible consequences of today's processes. It is noted that the fragmentation of the political space, which has been one of the features of its changes in recent decades, currently takes place largely due to the emergence of new parties. Based on empirical data presented in the article, the author states that a significant portion of numerous parties created in the region since 2000, make up the parties distinguished by anti-system orientations. Meanwhile, the article emphasizes the increased analytical complexity of differentiation between systemic and anti-systemic parties, conditioned by changes in the nature of anti-system phenomenon. In the past, the anti-system parties used to oppose the existing political system; nowadays these are the parties that are struggling not against the system but against the policy of systemic consensus uniting the political establishment. The distinction between systemic and anti-systemic parties is complicated also by the recent rapprochement of their positions on a number of important political issues. Changes in party-political space today are characterized by the interpenetration and synthesis of political positions various in its nature, which determine the essence of systemic and anti-systemic parties, creating a new quality of system policy. In this context, the introduction of the ideas articulated by anti-system populism (in their relatively deradicalized forms) into "the fabric of system politics" can ultimately lead to significant changes of European societies. In the author's view, the decline in popularity of populist parties is quite possible, but not in that of the policy which is usually characterized as populist.

DE age discrimination; discriminatory attitudes; older people; older
   generation; population aging
AB The aim of this article was to assess the scale and extent of discriminatory attitudes towards the older generation. The information basis of the research was studies of researchers in the field of sociology, demography, anthropology; data of the sixth wave of the world sociological research World Values Survey; the results of the consolidated ratings to assess the development of democratic institutions, the quality of life of older people. General scientific research methods (logical, system approaches, generalization method), statistical methods (groupings, samples, indices, correlation, pair regression equations), sociological and tabular methods of data visualization were used in the work. The first part of the article reveals the nature and essence of age discrimination in the context of cultural, economic and social changes. The second part of the article presents the results of testing the author's methodology for assessing the extent and prevalence of discriminatory attitudes towards older people in 56 countries. The integral index of tolerant attitude to the older was made, which consists of five private indicators with a marker of discriminatory attitudes: disrespectful attitude to the older; perception of the older as a burden for the state budget; perception of the older as a burden for society as a whole; perception of the older as unreliable workers; perception of the older as a social group with excessive political influence. The vertical of age discrimination in the countries of the world is built on the basis of the integral index of tolerant attitude to older people; grouping by interval values of the indicator is made. At the next stage, the links of the studied phenomenon with factor characteristics (demographic, economic, value and political) for all countries were checked. To identify the relationship between the effective (index of tolerant attitude to the older) and the factor signs, the equations of pair regression were consistently constructed, the correlation coefficient was calculated. It is revealed that countries with the lowest prevalence of age discrimination are characterized by a high average per capita income, less influence of traditions and values of religion, a much more developed system of democratic institutions, as well as not only a large proportion of older people, but also a much higher quality of their lives. The final conclusion is that the eradication of age discrimination is a phenomenon that accompanies the economic and socio-cultural modernization of the state.

DE personality-environment interaction; basic values; system of values;
   environmental identity; personal and professional development
AB High quality human capital is becoming the focus of modern ideas about the possible ways and strategies for further development of the Russian society. The capitalization of the human resource involves the presence of certain socio-cultural characteristics directly related to one's values and behavioural attitudes. In this regard, the issues of personality-environment interaction in the context of young people's personal and professional development are of particular relevance. The paper presents the results of comparative analysis of value orientations, features of environmental identity and parameters of personal potential in students of three Russian cities (Tomsk, Barnaul and PetropavlovskKamchatsky). The research tools included a number of questionnaires aimed at studying subjective evaluation of basic values realizability in the urban environment and specific features of university youth's environmental identity, as well as their value orientations and parameters of personal potential. There was a certain imbalance between the expected (the significance of basic values) and the real (the realizability of basic values) in relation to the urban environment potential in the cities examined. According to representatives of the so-called provincial cities, such environmental conditions to a lesser degree allow them to achieve a desired level of material well-being, safety, health and to implement their goals. A possible explanation for this disparity between the degree of significance of these basic values for young people in the regions and the possibility of their realization in their sociocultural environments is the specificity of the socio-economic situation in Russia, when major financial and human resources are concentrated in megapolises. Analysis of the study participants' value orientations, specifics of their environmental identity and parameters of their personal potential showed a rather high potential of the urban environment in Tomsk in the context of students' personal and professional development that corresponds to its status of an educational and innovative centre of Siberia. The study results and research approaches can be the basis for psychological support programs to enhance modern youth's personal and professional development, taking into account the environmental specifics.

Two concrete mechanisms are at work: first, people suffer less from stress related diseases, and second, they start investing more in their own health. To capture the proposed theoretical mechanisms, we use stress-caused mortality and private expenditures on health as our dependent variables. Empirically, we employ mediation analysis with country and time fixed effects. We find that, ceteris paribus, democratization and economic liberalization exert a cumulatively positive impact upon health. Our findings should be relevant to other countries that undergo politico-economic transitions.

   legal tradition
AB The political dimension of Plato's cosmological thought has been extensively explored as such and in its relation with Greek culture, but there remains a question of methodology. Which context will be more appropriate for Plato's works? Shall we focus on their metaphysical features (most conspicuous in Aristotle and Plato's immediate heirs in the Old Academy), or, alternatively, place them in a dialectical context (as in the case of the Skeptical Academy of Arcesilaus and Carneades)? On maybe, we have to plunge them in the depth of Greek cultural life and compare with technological advances of Greek civilization? This latter approach, having done properly, would be a real innovation, capable of as it appears, presenting a fresh look at the familiar matters. This is exactly the task of a new project launched by Dominic O 'Meaty in the book under review. Plato's cosmological and political ideas are successfully discussed here in their relation with ancient crafts, arts, and various peculiarities of social life of the Greek polis.

AB The article is dedicated to the conceptual analysis of globalization and the global world phenomena. The author's deliberations are based on the recent research by professor V.B. Kuvaldin "The Global World: Politics, Economy, Social Relations". The global world is defined as a key trend of contemporaneity whereas the singularity of neoliberal and West-centered model of globalization is called into question. In the focus of attention are problems of globalization's genesis, (in) stablity of policentric structure of international relations, interaction between Political and Economical, growing social inequalities and disparities. The author explores viability of the nation-state institution, elements of deglobalization, adaptability of the European Union to the changing nature of international environment. Both researches adhere to the vision of Russia's strategic thinking defined by its unique European and Pacific reach available to the "power of three oceans".

DE systems logic; system methods; theory of history; aspects of history;
   dialectics; theory of fuzzy systems; universal logic
AB System logic is an interdisciplinary logical approach which can be applied to the theory of systems. Among other spheres of cognition, it could be applied to historical reasoning. In order to serve as a reliable tool of the description and analysis of culturally complex social systems, logic must provide a verifiable scientific result. Therefore, it is used together with other system methods which distinguish the theoretical level of reflection on history from the philosophical one, and the theory of history, as an objective science, from the philosophy of history, typified by its subjective approach.
   The system logic is based on the formal logic. In addition to that, it has other sources, such as inductive logic, system theory, Husserl's theory of formal ontology, Zadeh's theory of fuzzy systems and fuzzy logic, temporal and other non-classical types of special purpose logic. This type of logic has its own imperative advantages in particular, it is able to stipulate not only linear consistency of theoretical conclusions in each of the aspects of history (social, political, ethnic, religious, cultural, etc.), but also their interlinear verification, based on the comparison of stage manifestations of different aspects of historical process.

   Batum Conference; Transcaucasian Sejm; Young Turks; Bolsheviks
AB The article studies the influence of Russia and Turkey on the political development of the South Caucasus in 1918. The choice of 1918 year is conditioned by its transitivity in the relations of two countries with regard to the Caucasus region: peace treaty was concluded, but cooperation was not achieved yet. After the fall of the monarchy Russia entered the stage of reconstruction, while Turkey was on the verge of the final fall of the Young Turks. For both countries the territory of the South Caucasus became the stage of political struggle for realizing imperial ambitions and an attempt to prevent the final territorial disintegration of states. The author shows a difference between Russian and Turkish political approaches. Turkey acted directly, holding negotiations and introducing troops, while Russia had no contacts with Caucasus officials and tried to weaken the Turkish activity in the region through Germany. The conflict nature of the region, which had earlier been suppressed by the power of Russian monarch y, was revealed now.
   The author presents the political development of the South Caucasus in the form of evolution from the idea of autonomy within the Russian statehood to the proclamation of independence of Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia. Considering the South Caucasus political development in the international context is conditioned by dependence on external challenges, which determined the decisions and actions of Caucasian political elites.
   On the one hand, the newly formed Caucasian governments declared their independence at the international level. On the other hand, these governments were dependent on the leaders of world politics in achieving their goals. The participation of Russia and Turkey in the political processes in the South Caucasus was associated with the contradictory aims. Both parties didn't want to be eliminated from the Caucasian region. At the same time, they tried to avoid military conflict. The Turkish government's motivation to use the military power consisted in the need to protect the Muslim population, but not in opposition to Russia. In general, year 1918 marked two opposite perspectives for both countries: for Russia - the loss of the Caucasus as a territory and a sphere of influence; for Turkey - strengthening positions through the local Muslim population.

DE Great Britain; Brexit; NATO; EU; the first cabinet of Teresa May;
   British defence and security policy
AB The article is devoted to formulating and pursuing of the British defence and security policy by the first government of Theresa May (July 2016 - June 2017) under the influence of Brexit which was anticipated in the nearest future. The author examines a new approach of the May's government to the defence and security policy which was aimed at acquiring a new world status of "Global Britain" after Brexit. This approach is seen as the creation of defence and diplomatic network consisted of British strategic relationships with key countries (such as the U.S. and France), the UK active membership in different international organizations, such as NATO and the UN, and participation in all sorts of regional bodies, military forces and preparations all over the world. The author also mentions two old British doctrines of colonial period which explicitly helped to formulate this strategy with two main aims: to build the global influence of the world's leading military and soft power, and to keep Britain, its citizens and its interests secure. In the article, there are several parts showing how May's government brings this strategy into life using different political tools. First of all, there is a part about British efforts to preserve Anglo-American special relationship during B. Obama's and D. Trump's U.S. presidencies through playing more active role in such military organization as NATO. British activity in NATO is considered mainly in the case of counteraction of the West to the false Russian threat to Poland and Baltic states as well as to Russian influence in the Western Balkans and the Black Sea region. The security and defence cooperation between the UK and the EU is also one of the topics of the article. The author pays attention to the British activity in the UN which helps Britain to make an impact on African affairs and to strengthen British position in the world.

He argues that the purpose of Schleiermacher's project was to transform the old-fashioned structure of German university as Middle Ages guilds into a modern corporation that fits the political conditions of modernity and the needs of Prussian state. This project was closely connected with the Prussian foreign policy ambitions - i.e., widespreading the German Geist in the cultural, educational and scientific spheres. The key point of this project was the idea of the hermeneutic circle. The author claims that Schleiermacher worked within the borders of externalism, while Kant preferred the internalist point of view in his "The Conflicts of the Faculties".

DT Article
DE History of Belief in the USSR; free churches in USSR; the Soviet
   workers; work in the USSR; work ethic; Christian ethic; communistic
   morals; rare (demand) specialty
AB The article deals with the process of formation of the identity of late Protestants (Evangelical Christians, Baptists and Pentecostals), which combines both religious and specific "Soviet" features. The article argues that the Soviet ideology had a great influence on the formation of their identity. At the same time, it refused to classify believers as honest and conscious citizens. Believers were marked as "others". Most believers positioned themselves as Soviet citizens, accepting the political system of the Soviet Union and socialist values, but having their own opinions about religion and its role in everyday life. The key value of the Soviet society was the right (and the honorable duty) to labour. Accordingly, in respect of people labeled as "other" (in the study period was a common euphemism for "dissenters") were often accused of parasitism. One of the notable categories of such "dissidents" in the late Soviet Union were Evangelical believers, who were also religious dissidents in the literal sense of the word. How did believers find the possibility of professional and creative implementation, as well as their financial support in an authoritarian state? To what extent did the traditional "Protestant ethics" (M. Weber) determine the values of the Soviet evangelicals in the socialist context? How did representatives of Evangelical communities fit into the complex social structure characterized as a system of "small transactions" of the Brezhnev's USSR? In this study, we aim to show the position of the believers themselves, who willingly talk about their conscientious work, emphasizing the ethics of their positions and contrasting themselves with the authorities and the official discourse. At the same time, a set of strict ethical rules in everyday life made Evangelical believers popular employees in the Soviet infrastructure. We argue that during the Brezhnev's period, the marginalization of believers at the ideological level and the restriction of access to intellectual and managerial resources were to some extent offset by their material wealth and access to certain scarce material resources and professions.

AB Introduction. The paper discusses the most common features of political myths which, with reference to Russia, are mainly built on superficial historical and cultural views on the political past of our country and a biased ideological assessment of contemporary political processes. In their research the authors use such methods as culturological, sociophilosophical and discourse analysis of public practices. The paper outlines the major topics highlighted in Western scientific literature and the media - Russia's underdevelopment, the authoritarian essence of the regime, its repressive nature, corruption, nationalism, violation of human rights and freedoms, aggressive foreign policy, etc. In the course of the analysis it is admitted that the Russian reality gives some grounds for such assumptions. At the same time, using some specific empirical data the authors put the critical judgments under corrective analysis and, consequently, refute many of them. Our opponents' main claim is Russia's inability or intentional unwillingness to become an organic part of Western civilization. Thereby, the critics refuse to recognise the right of the country to be conscious of its historical identity and to search for alternative routes of development. The research results consist in the conclusion that most Western myths manifest the denial of Russia as an autonomous power with its independent policy, and make an attempt to impose their own ideas and interests. However, a well-grounded and objective assessment of Russia is also to be heard from Western experts. The authors believe that the process of refusal from mutual accusations and stereotypes will be a long and difficult one, but it is crucial, too, if both sides are interested in establishing equitable partner relationships. To succeed in this, Russia has to overcome its internal challenges and contradictions and to secure ideological consensus and political consolidation of the society.
   O. V. Omelichkin has studied the peculiarities of political myths and their reflection in political consciousness of modern Russia. S. V. Biryukov has paid special attention to the analysis of Western mythologems and the prospects of forming the foreign political image of the country.

TI Formation and Operation of Customs Agencies in Crimea at the Initial
   Stage (1783-1822)
SO BYLYE GODY
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Russian Empire; XVIII - XIX centuries; the Crimean Peninsula; the
   customs authorities
AB The study of various aspects of the history of customs business in Russia is among the priority tasks facing modern historical science: the search for new economic instruments logically leads to the restoration of the functions of the customs authorities as a regulator of international economic relations, stabilization of the financial system, etc. The events of "Russian spring" attach particular relevance to it, when in 2014 the Crimean Peninsula was returned to the Russian Federation, resulting in formation of Crimean customs in the structure of the Federal customs service of the Russian Federation. Complex integration processes, problems of adaptation of power structures at all levels and the Crimean society as a whole to the modern Russian realities force to turn to the historical experience of nation-building, the interaction of political and social institutions of society, the history of everyday life. On the eve of the 235th anniversary of the entry of Crimea into the Russian Empire it is appropriate to draw a certain historical parallel between the events of past two hundred years and the present time.
   The main purpose of the research is to study the activities of the customs authorities of the Crimean Peninsula in 1783-1820, including the analysis of the legal basis of the Crimean customs and material, technical and financial support of the Crimean customs authorities. The first chronological date is connected with the entry of the Crimean Peninsula into the Russian Empire and fundamental changes in the customs sphere, which directly affected the Crimean Peninsula: customs institutions were reorganized or created anew, the regime of "Porto Franco" was introduced etc. The end date is connected with the beginning of activity of essentially new establishments-the border customs guard, introduced at the end of 1820s-and acceptance of the Customs tariff of 1822.
   Direct sources were the documents stored in the Russian state historical archive and the State archive of the Republic of Crimea. Also the documents of the departments of local history and departments of rare books of the largest Crimean libraries were attracted - A.H. Steven scientific library "Taurica", I. Franko scientific library, scientific library of V.I. Vernadsky Crimean Federal University, Simferopol.
   The use of a set of general scientific methods (typology, comparison, etc.) made it possible to ensure the reliability of the results on the problem studied. In this paper, we have used interdisciplinary and comprehensive approaches to the study of the topic, which allowed us to illustrate the actions of Russian authorities aimed at the integration and development of Crimea in the early years after the region's entry into the Russian State.

DT Article
DE sanctions against Iran; Iran; sanctions; JCPOA; U.S. foreign policy;
   Neoconservatism; democracy promotion policy
AB The article examines the current state of the U.S. sanctions policy towards Iran and its transformation prospects. Specifically, it describes new provisions of the sanctions regime under the "Countering America's Adversaries through Sanctions Act" of 2017, as well as other acting provisions of this policy. The authors present the current discourse on the subject in the American political establishment. The U.S.-Iran relations are traditionally of adversarial nature. For more than 30 years, the Islamic Republic of Iran is considered by the United States as a hostile, terrorism-sponsoring nation that threatens regional security in the Middle East. Since the Islamic Revolution of 1979, the Iranian government has been under a number of U.S.-imposed sanctions which only intensified through decades, although their efficiency was questionable until recently. The most serious impact on Iran's economy was made by multilateral sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council resolution 1929 (2010), which forced Iranian officials to participate in P5+1 negotiating process. The eventually adopted Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA (October 2015) stopped Iranians from getting a nuclear weapon. Since implementation of the deal (January 2016), the U.S. has lifted sanctions on Iran's economy in compliance with it. This sparked a political debate in the United States on whether Washington should unilaterally withdraw from the agreement or not. The opponents of the JCPOA, predominantly republicans, argue that Iran is using the relieved resources to fund terrorism, its destabilizing activities in the Middle East and to threaten U.S. allies in the region. The supporters of the deal, mostly democrats, presume that the withdrawal would only stimulate Iranians to get a nuclear weapon hence the failure of diplomatic means to solve the problem. Nevertheless, both parties consider Iran as a hostile regime, and in order to impose additional pressure on it for its policies, Congress almost unanimously passed the "Countering America's Adversaries through Sanctions Act" (2017). The Act severed the other existing sanctions not lifted by the JCPOA. By analyzing the U.S. sanctions policy towards Iran and the current discourse in the political establishment on the subject, the authors come to a conclusion that a unilateral withdrawal from the deal is not likely to happen. The United States will probably pursue a containment strategy towards Iran and will provoke its government to violate the JCPOA provisions - in order to re-impose severe sanctions on a multilateral basis, which would deliver the U.S. from undermining its relations with its allies.

DT Article
DE modern political science; political theology; religious and civil wars;
   politics and religion; state and Church; political liberalism; modernity
AB The evolution of Thomas Hobbes' political thought in the 1630s-1640s was marked by a considerable increase in an interest in the problems of the relations between politics and religion, and the state and the Church. This interest was expressed in his creation of the original conception of political theology, of which the most complete exposition is contained in his treatise Leviathan. In his concept of political theology, Hobbes saw an effective way to solve the theologico-political problem of modernity. At the heart of his political theology lays a new interpretation given by Hobbes to a number of doctrinal propositions of the Christian faith, which was designed to harmonize it with the absolute power of the temporal sovereign. Particular attention is paid to the consideration of those pragmatic strategies where Hobbes proposed to neutralize the explosive potential of the Christian religion for civil peace and the security of the state. It is also shown that the complete subordination of the Church to the State in the political theology of Hobbes served as a starting point for the impotent stage of the process of secularization of the Western world, which led to the separation of politics from religion, and the state from the Church.

AB The article deals with the analysis of the influence of the academic social media on the research practices. Based on the idea that social media constitute a new form of representation of scientific activity, the authors scrutinize the problem concerning their role in the process of legitimation of the new knowledge. The authors analyse the nets from the perspective of the "open science ideology" and show their full correspondence to its principles. In order to understand whether formal institutions of communication can be replaced with the social media, the empirical research was carried out: online survey among scientists who are users of the academic social media. The results indicate that social media have not yet become a virtual institution of academic recognition. The overwhelming majority of respondents use nets for reading new literature and uploading their own published works. It is shown that by virtue of the very characteristics of their functioning, social media reformat the scientific activity and change a scientist's motivation and values, forming the aspiration to the high net ranking and enlargement of content, citation, followings, traffic etc. The research shows the political essence of the "open science ideology" which appears to be an expression of some groups' aspiration to legitimate their own understanding of science and academic recognition. It is explicated that Internet media do not refuse but rather replace external regulators. Open science appears to be an instrument of legitimation and redistribution of power, and social media represent an effective means for this aim.

AB The understanding of the Russian phenomenon of electronic (digital) interaction between the state and society, theoretical studies within the framework of the so-called "movement for the reinvention of the government" is especially urgent in the context of the development of the digital economy as a new paradigm of the country's socioeconomic progress. In order to identify the peculiarities of the electronic (digital) government scientific discourse, the author attempts to structure and form the subject of e-government research in Russia (e-Government) using interdisciplinary approach. The main part of this study presents the scientific and quantitative analysis of journal articles, conference reports, books, dissertations and scientific works registered in national and foreign information databases and related to the Russian e-Government between 2001 and 2016. Based on the results of the survey of publications, selected on the basis of their citation index, among other criteria, the main thematic reference points in the e-Government research field were determined, and their comparison with foreign countries based on specific parameters was conducted. The author comes to the conclusion that the content profile of the publications within the Russian academic community is primarily related to the socio-political issues of e-Government, in contrast to the developed countries, where improvement (modernization) of management processes and the effectiveness of technology use have remained the most poignant for a decade. In general, the results and conclusions obtained by the author indicate the need for systemic changes in the procedures used in the study of e-Government. The results of the review of publications might be useful to the academic community in carrying out exploratory research, the development of new scientific directions, and helping experts in the search for ways to develop digital governance.

AB Authors analyze from the viewpoint of social philosophy and political sociology the historical implications of cultural approaches in political science as well as diverse prospects of their application, which consist in the possibility of promoting new ideas concerning correlation and interaction of culture and politics. The concepts considered in the article are aimed at the formation of a cultural paradigm in political science, which has various approaches that create conditions for the development and practical implementation of this insufficiently researched issue. Just as culture in general is a set of symbolic programs of human activity, political culture, in particular, is a special type of orientation toward political vision and action, reflecting both the specifics of each political system and the values of society, their philosophical justification and criticism. Culture and institutions, according to the authors, are closely intertwined with each other and can be separated only for analytical and methodological purposes. They act as two sides of the same coin: institutions are the product of culture and society, and culture and society, in turn, result in the action of institutions. The authors argue that the relations between institutions and culture acquire significance mainly in the following cases. First, this is the case of borrowing foreign institutions, if the cultural context of the new institutions is different from that of the recipient society. Secondly, it happens in an attempt to force changes in their own institutions due to changing cultural preferences or cultural conflicts. In any of these cases, we are talking about the design of new institutions or about changing cultures. This situation is examined with the application and development of the "intermediate institutions" concept.

AB The feature of the relationship between the USSR and Italy in the postwar world was that, on the one hand, Italy was a member of the NATO military-political bloc opposing the USSR, and on the other, the Italian Communist Party was the strongest Communist party of the non-socialist world. The Communist Party, which had a huge number of adherents and until the mid-1950's worked in close alliance with the Italian Socialist Party, could influence the formation of the image of the USSR in a significant part of the Italian population. From this point of view, the key events of the period were the Twentieth Congress of the CPSU and the events in Hungary (1956), when the perception of the Soviet Union by the Italian Left began to change and disagreements began in the left-wing camp that led to the end of the pact on the unity of action between communists and socialists.

DE electoral policy; electoral management; electoral bodies; electoral

AB The article focuses on the specifics of the origin and stages of development of the institution of electoral commissions as the most common bodies of electoral management.
   The author critically analyzes the range of the meanings of the term "electoral commission" and formulates his own definition - independent collegial bodies responsible for holding elections. Such a definition allows him to capture the essential characteristics of an institution, as well as to clarify the spatial and chronological boundaries of its origin. On the basis of the set of historical sources published in recent years, he shows that the first central electoral commissions appeared in the last quarter of the 19th century (in Colombia and Peru), which is more than half a century earlier of what the conventional wisdom holds.
   Electoral commissions have long been associated primarily with the developing countries. However, since the end of the 20th century they began to spread rapidly in the developed democracies. Today, this institution is in high demand in the countries with very different political regimes and levels of centralization of the electoral management. According to the author's conclusion, the potential of electoral commissions is far from exhausted. It is highly plausible that the institution of independent collegial bodies of electoral management, while retaining its basic features, will continue to evolve, and its certain modifications will play an important role in the electoral management system.

AB Social capital formation of the urban community contributes to the compactness of living, involvement in a variety of activities, the diversity of emerging problems and the possibility of their joint solutions. The purpose for the study is to study the social capital of urban communities of two major cities of the Vologda oblast - Vologda and Cherepovets - and identify their common and distinctive features. The theoretical framework of analysis lies in the concept of social capital, which demonstrated the role and importance of social relations for growth and development. Further expansion of the concept's problems caused interest in specific environments of its formation, including the city. The empirical framework of the study includes the results of a public opinion survey in the mentioned cities conducted by the experts of the Russian Academy of Sciences in June, 2017. The hypothesis of the study is that cultural, economic, and social differences affect the state of structural characteristics of social capital, particularly trust, which in turn affects the relations of solidarity and the level of responsibility for the state of affairs in the city. Characteristics of social capital such as the level of interpersonal and institutional trust, involvement in social and political life, readiness to unite with others were analyzed. It is noted that the state of the main indicators of social capital in cities varies. Analysis of specific features of its manifestation can provide information on the reasons for the existing differences in population's perception of government bodies, possibilities of their interaction, as well as information for making reasonable management decisions to avoid conflicts between the authorities and the population, creating conditions for strengthening their interaction.

AB This article considers the key concepts and topics of research on squatter or informal settlements in developing countries, including post-Soviet ones. During the first period (1950-early 1960s) three main viewpoints dominated in the field of such research: 1) squatter settlements as "transition zones"; 2) informal settlements as nests for crime, social disorder, social and personal disorganization; 3) informal settlements as "rural enclaves" in a city. The phenomenon of squatter settlements was considered a serious social problem for urban development. During the second period (late 1960s-1970s) researchers tried to dissolve the "myths" formed during the first period. The contestation between liberal and Marxist approaches is the leitmotif of this period. The advocates of the liberal approach argued that informal settlements were not a problem, rather they were a tool for solving the housing crisis in the cities of developing countries; such advocates also promoted a romantic image of squatter-landowners. The advocates of the Marxist approach, on the other hand, considered squatters as potential revolutionaries. During the third period (1980s-present) a lot of romantic views of squatter settlements were reconsidered. This period is characterized by conceptual pluralism. Although research on squatter settlements in post-Soviet cities is relatively young compared to the research in other developing countries, it has much to offer in terms of the concepts applied and the results obtained. Four key topics in the research on post-Soviet informal settlements can be identified: 1) the strategies of property acquisition in informal settlements; 2) the relationships between legal citizens and the dwellers of informal settlements; 3) the strategies of social and economical adaptation of rural migrants living in squatter settlements; 4) the relationships of the dwellers of informal settlements with the state and other political actors.

TI IN WHAT DOES LEVIATHAN DEAL? EVALUATION CRITERIA FOR STATES'
   COMPETITIVENESS ON "SALVATION MARKETS"
SO POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY
   OF POLITICS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE salvation markets; political groups (Verbande); hierocratic groups
   (Verbande); civil religion; political religion; "fight for the country"
ID CIVIL RELIGION
AB The metaphor "salvation markets" can be to some extent useful for understanding behavior of those actors who operate at the intersection of sacral and political fields, guided by their own rational logic, for example, states. The weakening of their soteriological function in the last decades can be explained by the contraction of "salvation market" itself due to the reduction of the amount of human suffering. However, this contraction turned out to be only temporary. The restoration of demand for salvation forces states to redefine their strategies, oscillating between various versions of "civil religion", "political religion", radical laicism etc. At the same time, there is a toughening competition between states and other operators of salvation - other forms of political groups (Verbande), as well as traditional and non-traditional hierocratic groups (Verbande).
   Hypothetically, the degree to which citizens are ready "to fight for their country" can serve as the evaluation criterion for states' competitiveness on "salvation markets". The hypothesis is supported by the fact that the category of the victim, which is present in one way or another in almost any sacral discourses and symbolical complexes, penetrated both discourses and mechanisms of symbolization and legitimation of the modern state. However, there are no intuitively obvious confirmations of this hypothesis in the sociological data. Meanwhile, a deeper analysis might help to reveal the supporting evidence of the hypothesis. Alternatively, there are grounds to suggest that further course of events will undermine altogether the efficiency of the "market" metaphor in this context - and will call for a different metaphor. Most likely, it would be the metaphor of "war".

AB The article analyzes how the Russian media cover activities of Alexei Navalny, an opposition politician. On the basis of the data from the company Medialogy, the author examines the intensity and tone of the discussion about Navalny in print and electronic newspapers, blogs, and also on the three largest federal channels - "Channel One", "Russia-1" and "NTV". Her research shows that the tendency to ignore Navalny's activities is almost an exclusive feature of television, which seeks a trade-off between silencing this activity and discrediting the politician, while other types of media cover it quite widely. According to the author's conclusion, Navalny attracts heightened attention due to both state actions directed against him, as well as his own political and anti-corruption activity.
   Despite a slight increase in the share of positive messages in the discussion about Navalny, it is predominantly of a critical nature. Curiously, the tone of the discussion depends on the communication channel itself rather than the occurring events. Different types of media cover the politician's activities in a different way: the same information can trigger criticism of Navalny in the traditional (pro-governmental) media and a campaign in his defense in the Internet publications and blogs.

AB The article deals with the condition of the Russian state and society in Putin's period. For the analysis, various international ratings and alternative assessments are used by the author. As an indicator of the quality of the state and publicity, their attitude toward objective information on the economic situation is suggested. According to the Russian tradition, the stateis treated as an important instrument of economic development. During the analyzed period, the role of the state has significantly increased, as a reaction to the negative consequences of its weakening in the 1990s. The nature and development of the Russian state was greatly influenced by the views and actions of V.V. Putin. The impact of Putin's life experience on his economic perspectives is analyzed. Putin'sprogram article written on the eve of the presidential elections of 2000 is considered. The author shows that the main directions of economic policy in Russia were outlined in the subsequent period. Putin's regime is characterized as a soft authoritarianism. The differences betweenthe indicators of the economic development of the Russian Federation and those of the successful countries adopted soft authoritarianism are explained. Political stability is noted among the positive consequences of soft authoritarianism in the economic field. Among the negative consequences, the lack of strategic thinking, the clan influences and the associated unsuccessful personnel policy, huge amounts of corruption are highlited. Dmitry Medvedev's different perspectives on the economy and society are identified, as a reaction to the economic failures that emerged during the 2008 crisis. A failure in their implementation is stated. The exhaustion of the positive influence of the Russian state on the economy is noted. The legislative and judicial power of The Russian Federation are analyzed: in an authoritarian regime, they ceased to be independent and positive. The state of public institutions is considered. Their degradation is stated. It is concluded that at present Russia lives in an creativeless institutional wilderness. Unsatisfactory state of the institutions is due to the consequences of the late Soviet legacy, the mistakes of the 1990s and the demographic crisis of the XX century, the degradation of education, culture and science.

DE Spain; state of autonomies; Basque Country; Catalonia; ETA; separatism
AB The politico-territorial organization of Spain (state of autonomies) that was formed at the transition stage from Francoism to representative democracy for a long time seemed rather viable. At the same time it is obvious that the state is incapable of fully integrating the Basque Country and Catalonia - the most developed and wealthy regions with distinct cultural-linguistic specificity. The Spanish authorities managed to triumph over the Basque separatist terrorist organization ETA that announced its disbandment. However, separatism in this autonomy continues to develop in peaceful forms. The powerful separatist movement in Catalonia that entered the scene at the times of global crisis challenged the principles of the Spanish territorial organization and exposed a number of problems requiring urgent solution.
   In this context, it becomes increasingly important to implement a set of financial-economic and political-legal reforms aimed at transforming the state of autonomies in order to strengthen it. First and foremost, it is necessary to modernize the Constitution of Spain that was adopted in 1978 during the democratic transition - its several provisions have outdated since then. However, there is a lack of a broad inter-party consensus necessary for reforming the legislation. The approaches to solving multifaceted political-territorial problem often only further fragment the leading parties of Spain.

AB The information space of the Baltic region has gradually developed since the free exchange of cross-border messages was made possible by media technology and international law. The international conflict between Russia and some countries of the European Union has become a factor hampering its sustainable development. Moreover, the conflict has adversely affected the functioning of many civil society institutions in the Baltic Sea region. This study focuses on the publications in the scientific media associated with the political technologies that may provoke conflict but must contribute to good-neigh-bourly relations in the region. We carry out a comprehensive political analysis and a specific examination of the Western scientific media to develop a package of measures that Russia can take to counter the conflict-provoking influences in the region. The current condition of the regional information space and information operations aimed at inciting Russophobia and forcing Russia out of the European political process is indicative of the politicisation of social sciences and the humanities and of the mythologisation of the policies of the regional social structures. The conflict must be urgently resolved, since the political technologies, which cause instability in the information space, damage the reputations of all the states involved. To reconcile the differences that underlie the information conflict in the Baltic region it is necessary to take into account common interests. There is a pressing need to join efforts in solving the challenging social problems that cannot be overcome without either international cooperation among the countries or effective social partnership.

AB The paper is devoted to the analysis of Eastern and Western burials' ceramic imports of Early Sarmatian archaeological culture in the Lower Volga region. Availability of the products from Central Asia, antique, meotian and the North Caucasus workshops provides not only chronological data, but also determines the relations of nomads with the agrarian population. Written sources indicate the intensification of political relations between the Sarmatians and the Greek cities of the Northern black sea region in the 2nd - 1st cc. BC. At the same time, the grave goods of the Lower Volga region's nomads, got replenished with the range of ceramic products produced in the Bosporan Kingdom, Kuban and in the workshops of the Central Caucasus. Besides, the relations with Central Asian centers were random, although the original migration of this time was traditionally associated with this region. The emergence of mass production of ceramics coming to the Sarmatians of the Kuban, the Don and the Volga region in this period, indicates the period of stability in the relationship between the nomadic world and settled population. Apparently, it should be assumed that new nomads, mixing and living side by side with a substrate population, managed to be included in the system of existing tribal relations, without destabilizing the situation.

AB The article analyses the results of the presidential elections in the post-Soviet Russia through the lenses of the cleavage theory. The research methodology includes factor analysis, correlation and regression analysis as well as special methodological tools: coefficients of maximum and effective range, politicization and socialization of electoral cleavages, and a coefficient of aggregate dispersion of electoral cleavages.
   The author concludes that parliamentary elections represent a much more fruitful ground for such studies because the existence of a front runner in presidential elections significantly distorts the political and electoral space of a country. The structure of the political cleavages (PCs) in elections by party lists has always been stable. All three PCs - socioeconomic, authoritarian-democratic and systemic - became evident already in 1993 and their hierarchy did not change throughout almost the entire post-Soviet period. In contrast, in the presidential elections these cleavages appeared separately only in 2000 and 2018, while in other cases systemic political cleavage "bandwagoned" with either socioeconomic or authoritarian-democratic cleavage.
   The author also documents different developmental trajectories in the structure of the electoral cleavages (ECs). In the presidential elections all three political cleavages initially were mapped into a single electoral cleavage, while in the parliamentary elections different political cleavages corresponded to different electoral cleavages. The structure of electoral cleavages in the presidential and State Duma elections became similar only in the 2000s, when the first electoral cleavage became associated with the authoritarian-democratic political one and the second EC - with the socio-economic PC. At the same time, 2016 and 2018 parliamentary and presidential elections witnessed a complete convergence to a single structure of political and electoral cleavages.

AB Leon Kosals, tenured professor at the National Research University Higher School of Economics (NRU HSE), was interviewed by Elena Berdysheva (NRU HSE). The interview focused on his research regarding the role of the police in the economy. Kosals has been involved in police studies since the 1990s when the existing Soviet system collapsed, transforming police activity and its relationship with society. Under the conditions of a weak state, policemen had to develop their own new coping strategies.
   According to Prof. Kosals, the police's informal economic activities are attributed to the core research areas for scholars from the CIS countries and Eastern Europe. The most critical issues include relationships between the police and ethnic minorities, police violence, the role of police in local communities, and the digitalization of police activity.
   Prof. Kosals also discusses interactions across different disciplines involved in police studies, including methodological bridges between sociology and criminology. He highlights the necessity of a fruitful partnership between social researchers and representatives of the security agencies as an important goal for multidisciplinary studies.

AB The attitude of Russian conservative publicists of the middle - second half of the 1890s to the economic situation that developed on the Western outskirts of Russia in the early years of the reign of Nicholas II is considered. The novelty of the study is that the economic development of the then territories of Ukraine, Lithuania, Belarus and the Baltic States is considered for the first time through the prism of the views of representatives of the domestic conservative nationalism ("Russian trend"), for which the Baltic and former old Russian lands were the arena of the age-old struggle of the Russian people with "Polonism" and "Germanism." Particular attention is paid to the conservative ideas about the influence of ethno-confessional and class factors on the economic situation in these key regions for the Russian Empire. Also, attention is paid to the conservative estimates of the political importance of German colonization in the Western Russian provinces and the role of the "foreign" factor in the economic life of the country. The measures by which the conservatives hoped to adjust the resettlement policy and complete the thirty-year process of Russification of the Western suburbs are shown. It is concluded that during this period the views of conservative circles maintained the inertia of the previous reign, which consistent with the new political and economic realities.

DT Article
DE Marxism; Marxist tradition; early capitalism; industrial society;
   socialism; Leninism; informational socium
AB The 200-years' jubilee of Karl Marx is an occasion to reflect on the Marxism's destiny from historical distance. Contemporary reality differs drastically from that of the XIX and early XX centuries. It calls for a critical analysis of Marxism and its historical place in mankind's theoretical and mass consciousness. Marx had created a holistic political-economic and philosophical-historic conception of social development on the base of limited experience of the early capitalism. The author distinguishes between the authentic Marxism as an intellectual co-domain of the then reality and successive Marxist tradition. In the vein of this tradition Marxism has been rethought in accordance with new experience of the mature industrial society, including sprouts of "post-industrialism" and "post-capitalism". This "identity" of two facets of Marxism stresses its creative capability to actualization in the epoch of big changes in human community. It is possible to cognize antinomic pluralistic wholeness of nascent information society only as a result of synthetic interaction of different existing spiritual ideological traditions. Revolutionary-critical approach towards reality gives to Marxist tradition a good chance to take its well-deserved place in the global intellectual cooperation.

   pathologies; glocalized corruption; network corruption; the staging of
   corruption; the export of corruption; butterfly effect; provocation
AB The article examines the factors and conditions for complicating the forms of corruption that affect the relations between countries and form new trends of international cooperation. While in traditional and even industrial societies the nature of corruption was determined by the peculiarity of local social pathologies, under the conditions of dynamically developing globalization processes corruption goes beyond the national and territorial context, acquires fundamentally new qualities. The world community has witnessed the formation of glocalized corruption. Like any other complex phenomenon, the corruption is subjected to non-linear development. With the preservation of the "old" forms of immoral-unlawful mercenary behavior, new, more cynical and dangerous forms of corruption emerge, forming unprecedented hybrid pathologies. Quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the glocalized corruption are largely due to the increasing scale and inconsistency of international interaction, uncontrollable openness of modern society. Corruption has become networked. There is also a paradoxical combination of objective realities and staged corruption that ambiguously affects international cooperation. On the one hand, international anti-corruption structures are being formed, and on the other hand, the staging of corruption, which has become an integral part of modern provocations. The article also presents the main meanings and meaningful characteristics of international cooperation in the field of combating corruption, problem areas, forms of existing and possible cooperation between Russia and other states and international organizations in this field. It is substantiated that the policy of counteracting corruption and the measures that are being taken at the national level can no longer be functionally effective. Thus, the task of consolidated anticorruption actions on a global scale is being actualized, including countering the policy of exporting corruption and corruption technologies. Without a close interaction of national political structures, law enforcement bodies with scientific centers that study the new social pathologies it is practically impossible to defeat corruption evil. The most important prerequisite for the success of such cooperation is the constructive interaction between governments, law enforcement and judicial bodies, structures of the civil society.

AB The paper reflects an experience of empirical research on the institutional and regulatory component in the modernization of Russian regions that are historically at different levels of civilizational development. The information basis of the study includes findings of a mass representative survey ("civil examination") conducted by the Center for the Sociology of Management and Social Technology at the Institute of Sociology of the Russian Academy of Sciences; the survey was carried out in four constituent entities ofthe Russian Federation: the Moscow Oblast, the Republic of Bashkortostan, the Belgorod Oblast and the Republic of Kalmykia; the assessment of their development include criteria of the level of socio-cultural modernization (grant # 15-18-30077). We believe that higher education is an underestimated resource of the state strategy for socio-cultural modernization of regions. People with higher education are considered as an avant-garde social group able to exert an increasing influence on the harmonious development of the country. This group is characterized as a "soft" force in the support of constructive actions of the power vertical and in the future - as a centripetal factor capable of providing a high level of solidarity in the Russian society in solving multidisciplinary problems of modernization. We elaborate the research tools outlined in the article "The Role of Institute of Higher Education in Solving the Issues of Socio-Cultural Modernization of Regions" (Economic and Social Changes: Facts, Trends, Forecast, 2017, vol. 10, no. 5). We clarify the empirically tested hypotheses: first, socio-cultural modernization of Russian regions is associated with the degree of development of their government systems that depend, in turn, on social organization and self-organization, the hierarchy of groups, including the population with higher education, and their interest in the process of modernization; second, the social group of the population with higher education is an electorate with average estimates of social and political activity, which can play an important role in the development of problem situations in regions with different levels of modernization and in the creation of new models of organizational development and management. The goal of our study is to identify the degree of social support that the population with higher education provides to the policy of the power vertical and its individual links. We provide the results of analysis of socio-economic indicators of regional development, taking into account the place and role of the population with higher education. The tools of the survey are designed to conduct further comparative studies on larger samples.

DT Article
DE legal policy; instruments; priorities; legal acts; acts of doctrine;

AB Legal policy is considered in the article as an instrument for ensuring systematic and effective development of the legal system in the information society. To build up the legal policy of modern Russia one must, firstly, define its priorities, and, secondly, ensure the legal policy with the relevant means. With regard to the problem of the content of modern legal policy, the authors propose their methodology of the research: through the identification of priorities of legal policy and dividing the latter into meaningful and instrumental ones. We prove the thesis that instrumental priorities, in particular, the formation of special tools of legal policy activities, are nowadays of paramount importance for the formation and implementation of effective legal policy of the state as a whole. With regard to the problem of legal policy, the authors justify the need for distinguishing a special group of legal acts - doctrinal legal instruments designed to ensure the formation and development of the legal policy as a form of state activity. Doctrinal acts can reflect scientific, strategic and targeted character of legal policy, but at the same time they require formal inclusion into the system of legal acts of the state and giving them legal force and legal significance. In recent years, political (political and program) acts are actively used in the Russian legal system; however, they have neither a clear understanding in legal theory nor a clear legal regulation. Researchers often do not recognize their legal nature, considering them as political instruments. The modern theory of legal acts must be based on a "broad" approach to legal acts' understanding, which involves the recognition of acts in various forms (not only written ones) as legal acts and by various actors (including individuals). Following this approach, the doctrinal documents become part of the system of legal acts. All elements of the system of legal acts must have certain legal and technical characteristics and fulfill specific functions in legal regulation. The authors of the article offer their own concept and characteristics of legal acts in order to explore the specific doctrinal acts on this basis. The paper considers the problems of legal regulation of doctrinal legal acts, examines the features of legal nature of these groups of acts, and their relationship with other legal acts.

DT Article
DE electric power integration; forecast; power consumption; systemic
   benefits; Russia; Eurasia
AB The paper analyses current state and prospects of interstate power integration of Russia with the neighboring Eurasian countries. The integration is based on the creation and operation of interstate electric ties and joint construction of power facilities. The authors assess national programs of energy development in Russia and neighboring countries, forecasts of international organizations. The modeling makes it possible to determine the most economically sound options for the prospective configuration of interstate electric ties, considering technical, economic, geopolitical and environmental constraints. A retrospective analysis was made with a focus on the economic growth rates, an increase in electricity consumption due to the economic growth, a change in the energy-GDP ratio, an increase in the population number and trends in per capita electricity consumption of developing countries approaching the level of developed countries. Consideration is given to all countries bordering Russia. They are arranged in 5 groups: 1) Scandinavia and Baltic states; 2) Eastern Europe; 3) the Caucasus and Asia Minor; 4) Central and South Asia; 5) East Asia. It is shown that the most important factors determining the need and capability of electric power integration are the economic growth rates, the increase in electricity consumption and the extent to which the countries are provided with their own natural resources. In this context, the conclusion is made that power export to the countries of East Asia, particularly Japan and Republic of Korea, will be the most effective. Russia, with its favorable geographical position, large territory, extended latitudinal electric network infrastructure and great potential of natural energy resources, can play an essential role in building the Eurasian supergrid. In this case, Russia (as well as other countries participating in the electric power integration) may gain numerous positive system benefits: a) reduced costs of commissioning new capacities; b) improved operating conditions of power facilities (on a daily and annual basis); c) increased reliability of the integrated power system; d) more renewable generation in the energy balances of different countries; and e) the countries with substantial energy resources, in particular Russia, will get considerable revenues from exports. Moreover, the energy integration will facilitate closer political relations among the involved countries and normalization of the international situation at whole.

ID ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT; PATRIMONIALISM
AB The article summarizes the claims made for increasingly popular neopatrimonialism concept. Formed as a response to non-obviousness of basic assumptions and conceptual lengthiness of transit paradigm, neopatrimonialism concept itself became to generate significant conceptual stretching in the analysis of states, political development that contrasts with the Western democratic patterns. Regarded as neopatrimonial, African, Latin American, Southeast Asian, Central Asian and Eastern European states vary greatly according to the imposing volume of settings: on the principles of bureaucracy functioning, on the degree of political competition, on the role and the spread depth of the patron-client networks, nepotism and other informal practices. Therefore, speaking about neopatrimonialism, researchers focus each time on a different set of characteristics. An impressive body of empiric neopatrimonial researches sprained his conceptual framework to significant confusion. Following the theory of conceptual stretching by D. Sartori, one can say that in comparative neopatrimonial studies there is violation of rules on climbing the ladder of abstraction. Against the background of a large number of empirical studies carried out in line with the neopatrimonial paradigm, researches on understanding neopatrimonial concept per se constitute a negligible percentage and require development. The indiscriminate and uncritical application of neopatrimonial paradigm can be overcome through the more complete conceptualization of the neopatrimonialism concept. One of the main tasks in this way is the classification of neopatrimonial regimes. Author analyzes the existing approaches to such classifications and justifies the necessity of separation neopatrimonial regimes for regulated and predatory forms. The article analyzes the concepts emerging in the related fields of Political Studies, for their ability to enrich the proposed classification of neopatrimonial regimes. The idea of predatory neopatrimonial forms enriched by achievements of the "predatory state" phenomenon research. Neoinstitutional dilemma of the credible commitment of property rights could potentially be fruitful to study the regulated forms of neopatrimonialism. This approach to classification of neopatrimonial regimes offers significant prospects for further operationalization and conceptualization of neopatrimonialism.

AB The aim of the presented article is to consider the discussions about the situation at "the western sector of the historical front". The source base of research consists of the published and unpublished works of soviet historians and members of Communist party: the articles in politics and scientific reviews and the archival materials of discussion (the funds of Archive of Russian Academy of Science and Russian State Archive of Social and Political History). The author analyzed these materials in a broad scientific and political context. This discussion was the last of three others. There were the discussion about German Social-Democracy and the discussion about the bourgeois historians of the West in USSR. The initiators of the discussion at "the western sector of the historical front" were the members of the Leninist international school. The members of the Comintern played a huge role in this discussion, they demanded from the Soviet historians of the West to study the topics necessary for the international revolutionary movement. At the same time, the participants of this discussion criticized the basic ideas of N. M. Lukin, G. S. Fridliand, V. P. Volgin and other Soviet specialists in the history of the West. The goal of this critics was affirmation of authority of the Communist politics in the historical research. The result of the discussion was the resolution of the Presidium of the Communist Academy about the situation at "the front of the history of the West". The authors of this resolution also criticized the Soviet Marxist historians and wanted to make the main subject of research for Soviet scientists the problem of imperialism. The author of the article came to the following conclusions. The discussion on "the western sector of the historic front" was a form of mobilization of soviet historians. This discussion led to the politicization of Soviet historical science. Now the political power dictated to scientists research topics and methods of its study.

TI Power as a Subject of Social Philosophical Reflection
SO VOPROSY FILOSOFII
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Hannah Arendt; power; society; philosophy
AB Reflections on the nature of power and ideology have always been at the center of philosophical attention. A person becomes a "zoon politikon" as soon as he begins to function as a subject of social life. And therefore, the sphere of political activity, one way or another, invariably appears in the field of philosophical research. But at the same time, the author emphasizes that political activity is precisely the object of philosophical research, and the philosopher himself must be distanced from power. This, by its very nature, ambivalent position, gives rise to the problem of the interrelationships of philosophy and power in general, which is reveals in the conflict between the philosophical position of a philosopher seeking free thinking and his involvement in a particular ideological situation, which always turns out to be a concentrated expression of the interest of the dominant power structures. Therefore, when a philosopher, tempted by his closeness to politics, becomes an ideologist, he risks being only a means to achieve the goals of the power structures. The author believes that everyone has a personal limit of how far his alliance with political power can go, and therefore a philosopher can remain free within any totalitarian system and not free in a democracy. But a philosopher who reflects on power and ideology should, at the same time, reflexively control the distance in relation to these spheres of activity, thus avoiding confusion of his theoretical arguments with his possible political position.

ID ORGANIZATION
AB This article is devoted to the sociological analysis of judicial proceedings in Russia. The study is based on data collected through participant observation in Russian criminal courts in 2014-2015. I focus on the following topics: public access to judicial proceedings, the orientation of judges towards the audience, ceremonial and procedural rules of social interaction and their enforcement, and transformation of the social status of a defendant during trials. In the theoretical section, I outline the differences between a theatrical play and a court hearing. Unlike in a theater, in a courtroom playing a role has consequences. However, the concept of performance remains useful in describing court hearings. The article offers three explanations of the performativity of judicial proceedings: political, legal, and social. The difference between the approaches is relates to the type of audience for which trials are performed: ordinary citizens, the judge, or the defendant. Analyzing the results of observations, the study tries to answer the question of who is the main audience in Russian courts. The reluctance to make court hearings more transparent and accessible to lay people, disregard for procedural rules, the violation of defendants' rights, the frequently reduced procedures for examining criminal cases-all these factors affect public perception of Russian courts as places where fair justice is produced. I conclude that trials in Russia are a theater without a public, an argument without adversity, and a ritual without sacredness. Judges are engaged in routine bureaucratic activities where little space remains for making professional judgments and applying judicial discretion.

AB From time immemorial, the relative sustainability of human communities (from primitive tribes to nations, social classes or world confessions) has been provided by the image of a common enemy. Inter-group conflicts have been abridging in-group violence and with it, have been setting the vector for the creation of life's meanings. Yet, the current level of technological development completed by blurring lines both between war and non-war technologies and between the conditions of peace and war has made this psychological inertia suicidal. So the problem of life's meanings is becoming the nucleus of the 21st century global problems: Will the human mind prove ready to develop strategic meanings beyond religious or quasi-religious ideologies which are always built on the "them-us" mental matrix?
   Insights of great philosophers and prophets, as well as some crucial episodes in political history and special socio-psychological experiments have demonstrated that besides the image of a common enemy, both human solidarity and strategic meanings can be built on the image of a common cause (not aimed at an enemy agent), although the experience of assimilating this kind of construct by the mass consciousness is scanty. Instead, historical evidence is abundant showing that after long periods without real or potential wars, life's meanings "hang up" and the masses feel nostalgia for new demons. Actually, we observe an intensification of this trend in many regions of our planet accompanied by a growing instability in global geopolitics. An international educational program designed to develop cosmopolitan worldviews free from group-versus-group attachments is suggested in the paper.

TI EDUCATION AS FICTITIOUS CAPITAL: THE CRISIS OF SOCIAL IMPORTANCE OF
   KNOWLEDGE
SO LOGOS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE mass education; higher education; fictitious capital; formal indicators
   of the effectiveness of education; competence approach
AB The article describes the system of mass higher education in terms of political economy. The author discusses how the social and economic results of the education system depend on the principles of its organization. In identifying the economic effect of education, the author emphasizes that in certain circumstances certificates of education may function in the market as fictitious capital, increasing the economic opportunities of certificate holders without any basis in an actual increase in training or professionalism. The analogy with fictitious capital is methodologically justified because the certificate itself brings about an increment in money received although it creates no new value. The social consequence of the formalization of education is the falsification of its cultural content and significance. This formalization of education and the decline in the role of education and knowledge in society may make the cultural capital to which education contributes fictitious as well because it is verified only by a certificate of qualification in place of an actual advanced level of education.
   The author describes the process of formalization of education as a bureaucratic attack on the autonomy of the academic environment. To overcome the formalization of education and to repel this bureaucratic attack on it, it is necessary to establish the proper conditions for academic and personal development while enlisting society at large in formulating standards and specific criteria for the development of education. The author sees the processes taking place in education as signs of a crisis of institutionalization as a principle for regulating human activity. This crisis is manifested today not only by numerous disruptions in the operation of the educational system but also in the crisis concerning its social significance, and more broadly in questioning the social significance of knowledge.

DE CLIL technology; Content and Language Integrated Learning; language
   proficiency; professional oriented training; academic interaction
AB Current integration and globalization processes in all sectors of life provide the urgency of language proficiency in Russian universities. Having analyzed legal documents in the sphere of education of Russian Federation, learned the experience of foreign and Russian scientists and taken into account the results of personal teaching for a long time the authors prove the feasibility of CLIL (Content and Language Integrated Learning) technology to encourage academic language proficiency.
   As the issue how to develop language proficiency in universities has been thoroughly investigated by such scholars as D. Marsh, B. Marsland, K. Stenberg, D. Wolff, certain reasons concerning Russian educational policy are stated by the authors in order to update and implement CLIL technology in professional oriented language training in South Ural State University.
   The essence of CLIL is regarded by the authors as a simultaneous development of professional and language competences within two years of exposure to the second language. A special attention is given to the implementation analysis of various CLIL patterns (extension of language material, modular teaching and subject immersion) during the third and fourth terms of teaching when undergraduates of South Ural State University master the course "Professional oriented foreign language".
   Further, the introduction of content and language learning in university is justified by the constructivist theory or constructivism where there are two central themes: any learner can construct knowledge and the construction process is possible through social interaction; by cognitive bilingualism (J. Cummins) and integration approaches.
   The paper tackles the methodology and forms of CLIL technology applied in experimental groups (The Faculty of Journalism, Economics and Political Science Faculties) to turn traditional education towards a more real, fruitful and motivating task, as modern students need to be challenged and prepared how to live and work outside the university.
   Moreover, the authors highlight the fact that to put such technology in practice the following factors are essential: learning pack in foreign language due to the specialty; upgrade training courses for teachers within CLIL; academic interaction of language and subject teachers.
   The scientific experiment conducted for many years in South Ural State University has proved to be efficient as it provides students with unique language training that may benefit learning process as a whole. Having analyzed the results, the authors conclude that the implementation of CLIL technology in SUSU has exerted a significant impact on language proficiency and intrinsic motivation of students.

AB The political images formed in the mass consciousness largely determine not only the attitude of citizens to certain political events and objects, but also their political behavior. Due to the fact that modern politics is increasingly becoming virtual, one should not underestimate the impact of mass communication on the formation of these images. It is obvious that the contextual factor, including situational changes occurring in the political arena both inside the country and outside it, is the determining factor in the content of the information that comes from the media and on the basis of which, accordingly, political images are formed in the mass consciousness. The article attempts to analyze the transformation of communicative images of power and political leaders of Great Britain under the influence of Brexit, i. e. during the period from 2014 to 2017. Since the main economic partners of this country are the United States and the European Union countries, the main news channels of these countries served as the source of data for the content analysis: American CNN and FOX News, as well as European Euronews and France24. According to the methodology developed at the Department of Sociology and Psychology of the Politics Department of the Lomonosov Moscow State University, a study was carried out which main goal was to compare the communicative images of power and political leaders of Great Britain in terms of strengths, weaknesses, attractiveness, unattractiveness, activity and passivity before and after Brexit. According to the results of the research, it was found that the image of power, regardless of the country's media affiliation, undergoes minor changes, which can't be said about the image of D. Cameron. The data obtained during this kind of research not only gives an idea of the actual image broadcasted by the media, but also allows us to identify both the psychological mechanisms of its formation and the limits of the influence of the media on the stable mental structures of citizens. In practice, such data can allow to determine those actions that the country needs to take to form its image and information strategy.

DT Article
DE foreign policy; military policy; military-political situation; North
   East Asia; Japan Self-Defense Forces; Japan-U.S. alliance
AB The article considers the specific features of Japan's foreign policy course in the light of the present situation in North East Asia, which is undergoing substantial change due to the weakening of the role of the United States, the rising economic and political power of China, as well as the aggravation of a number of regional contradictions and conflicts. In these circumstances, Japanese leadership takes several steps in the military-political field, serving testament to the Japanese foreign policy course becoming increasingly active.
   From Japan's point of view, the main threats to its security are, first and foremost, "the China factor" and "the threat from the DPRK". The former is caused, to a large extent, by the exacerbating Japan-China territorial dispute around the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands, which forces Japan both to upgrade its military might and to expend efforts in order to strengthen its cooperation with the United States and, potentially, other regional nations. However, the territorial dispute is but a manifestation of deeper contradictions, in this way or another affecting the entire spectrum of Japan-China relations, even though this does not prevent Japan from seeking ways to develop friendly relations with the PRC. Meanwhile, the territorial issue and the problems of historical past mar not only Japan-China, but only Japan-South Korea relations. Japan also takes measures to defend itself from "the threat from the DPRK", which is expressed, largely, in its strict policy regarding the anti-DPRK sanctions and the resolution of the Korean missile and nuclear issues, its efforts to resolve the problem of abducted Japanese citizens, and also, in the field of military policy, in the development of a national missile defense system.
   At the same time, Japan's relations with Russia in the military-political field develop largely in a good-neighborly fashion. While certain problematic issues remain, officially, Japan does not see Russia as a threat and advocates the maintenance of broad contacts between Moscow and Tokyo in this field.

AB This article is devoted to the analysis of the growing importance of the Eurasian direction in Japan's foreign policy, the causes and consequences of the duality and inconsistency of this policy, the influence of internal political reasons on Japan's alignment with its policy towards the Central Asian states. The process of building up a new system of Japan's foreign policy behavior in Central Asia in this case has developed in a reactive as opposed to a proactive manner. Eurasian direction of Japan's diplomacy demanded a serious revision because by the new project "One Belt, One Road", which is an unprecedented regional initiative of Beijing - the primary foreign policy opponent for Tokyo. The regional agenda of Tokyo is also influenced by the new approaches of Donald Trump's administration to the multilateral cooperation's forms. Tokyo's attempts to pursue its relations with the Central Asian states as a whole region and the Japan's experience of using the dialogue "Central Asia plus Japan" as a promising model for the cooperation between non-regional actors and its Central Asia's partners, are also of interest. In addition, the article deals with the preconditions for coordinating actions in the Eurasian direction between Japan and its friendly states, including Turkey and India, and the process of diversifying the economic partners of the Central Asian region as a whole. Since the reasons for the interest of the Central Asian states in the implementation of economic and other forms of cooperation with Tokyo have not lost their relevance, Russia could be of significant value to Tokyo.

AB This article characterizes foreign policy and the cultural and diplomatic aspects of the XII World Festival of Youth and Students (Festival-85) that was held in Moscow from July 27 to August 3, 1985. Based on various sources, including archival and published documents, press materials, and eyewitness accounts, the author examines the place and role of this mega-event in Soviet cultural diplomacy in the final stage of the Cold War. The present projection of the festival program had anti-imperialist rhetoric directed against the USA and other capitalist countries, aggravated by military-political opposition of the two blocks in Afghanistan and Latin America in the mid-1980s. In designing images of the past, main attention was been paid to justifying the key role of the USSR in the victory in World War II and to raising historical parallels between fascism and American imperialism. The Soviet Union was positioned as the unique center for consolidation of anti-imperialist forces capable of solving mankind's global problems, such as the threat of a new world war, uneven and unstable economic development, and racial, national, and political discrimination. At the same time, freedom of festival communication was limited, and the Soviet side aimed to avoid discussion of "loaded questions" connected with events in Afghanistan and the restriction of the rights and freedoms of Soviet citizens. Also, despite the aspiration to show socialism's absolute advantages and exclusive merits of the "new Soviet person," Soviet leaders could not solve several organizational problems that drew attention of the western press.

LA English
DT Article
DE political realism; energy diplomacy; theory of diplomacy; scientific
   policy; MGIMO scientific school; OPEC
AB Nowadays energy diplomacy tends to be one of most relevant and important fields of applied research in International Relations. It is characterized by an interdisciplinary approach being an intersection of political and economic theory, international law, energetics, theory of diplomacy, as well as other fields. Still, numerous research works in the given area both in Russia and abroad are characterized by a number of controversies, such as absence of a common theoretical, methodological basis and conventional terminology, as well as lack of consistency in the choice of scientific paradigms, which leads to divergence of research results and hinders the comparability of the latter. Along with that, in terms of scientific policy it is worth mentioning the absence of a common scientific space in the above field of research, which tends to be shaped by national research cultures and traditions. Throughout the 2000-2010s representatives of the MGIMO scientific school have accumulated experience in dealing with problems of energy diplomacy. However, most of the existing works do not specify the selected political theory paradigms, such as, for instance, realism, liberalism or constructivism. With no intention to conduct a comparative analysis of the aforementioned concepts, the authors of the article outline the key theoretical findings of political realism as the most suitable paradigm for explaining, analyzing and eventually forecasting the recent trends and phenomena given the current geopolitical and economical juncture. They prove the applicability of the proposed model to the OPEC case study and demonstrate its potential practical usefulness for policy-makers in foreign affairs and international energy relations.

TI Aquinas's Ecological Vision: Natural Law and Friendship in Contemporary
   Environmental Political Thought
SO NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID SYNDERESIS
AB This article examines Aquinas's thinking about law and nature to show that for Aquinas natural law is not about deriving or finding normative rules (standards) in the order of the cosmos or requirements of practical rationality. Rather, I argue that for Aquinas, natural law is a distinctive way of theorizing relationality and embodiment in the "sublunary realm": one that aims at "friendship" across species lines (STI-II99.2-3). The word Aquinas uses to describe this ecological practice is synderesis. For Aquinas, synderesis is both the human-creaturely capacity to grasp the analogical structuring of reality and the "disposition" that allows us to work on transforming this reality into belonging-together through our participation in natural law (STI79; DV15-17). Synderesis is thus of central importance to Aquinas's account of natural law, yet it is largely overlooked by modern natural law theorists. The article concludes by exploring how Aquinas's natural law thinking might contribute to an environmental politics of friendship.

DE historicism; philosophy of history; philosophy of spirit; romanticism;
   Hegelianism; Marxism
AB Historism (historicism) in a most general sense is a principle of historical science, which demands to see the phenomena in their development and connection with concrete circumstances of the past. In a more narrow sense it is a trend in the European historical thought, emerging under the influence of German Romanticism-and-Hegelianism. Specific features of it were the romantic thesis about uniqueness and singularity of individuals, cultures and epochs, the opposition of methods of natural and human sciences, view of history as a history of spirit (Geist). The overcoming of this program in historical science occurred during the first decades of the XX century, the philosophical critics had to do mostly with its relativism. K. Popper's critics of "historicism" had nothing to do with these debates or with German Historismus itself. Indeterminism of Popper and F.A. Hayek is close to this Historismus; their direct precursor and mentor L. von Mises himself developed the ideas of German historical school in "national economy". In the debates on positivism in sociology, transformed then into debates on hermeneutics took part Popper's disciple H. Albert, but he negated the methodological dualism of "emancipative" hermeneutics of J. Habermas and K.-O. Apel, without any reduction of Historismus to economical determinism. Among the opponents of historicism in political philosophy important were the arguments of L. Strauss. In polemics with A. Kojeve he turns against not only of the Hegelianism or Romanticism; Historismus with its radical relativism begins with Machiavelli and Hobbes, from the outset of the Modernity.

TI KOLCHAK COUP D'ETAT IN COVERAGE OF RUSSIAN MEMOIRS

   Directorate; the Council of Ministers; the coup; dictatorship; A.V.
   Kolchak
AB In November 18, 1918 in Omsk a coup was staged, in the course of which the replacement of supreme power in the counter-revolutionary camp occurred. The Directorate (Provisional All-Russia Government) elected at the State meeting in Ufa was abolished, and instead an individual rule of the Supreme Governor was established, A.V. Kolchak being elected for this position.
   In the paper the task is set to find and critically analyze memoir literature of participants and contemporaries of that event to reveal factual completeness, precision and credibility. The necessity of such analysis is accounted for by the fact that, up to now, memoirs have remained the most important source base from which researchers, publicists and popularizers of historical knowledge not only get information, but also widely use its interpretations and conceptual ideas. For solving the set task the memoirs of well-known journalists, political and military figures have been analyzed in the paper: L.V. Arnoldov, A.A. Argunov, M.V. Vyshnyak, G.K. GuMs, K.Y. Gopper, I.S. Ilyin, L.A. Krol, I.M. Maysky, S.P. Rudnyev, K.V. Sakharov, N.V. Svyatitsky, I. I. Serebryannikov, M.I. Smirnova, A. S. Soloveychik, I. I. Sukhin.
   It has been found out that the memoirs contain the most voluminous, diverse and reliable information concerning the social and political situation in Omsk after the Directorate moved there, as well as the arrest and further troubles of its socialist and revolutionary part (SRs). The memoirists very scantily and inconsistently covered the meeting of the Council of ministers that lasted for several hours, where key decisions were taken: it was admitted that the Directorate stopped its activity; the Council of ministers resolved to take over all the state power, and then it decided to repose power temporally in the hands of one person, awarding him the title of the Supreme Governor; it elected A.V. Kolchak for this post. However, the memoirs have not practically any concrete and reliable information about the plot.
   In the published memoirs serious contradictions were found which have factual and conceptual character. These are explained by the fact that the memoirists originally possessed fragmentary and inconsistent information, besides they took different political positions during the Civil War. Such content of the memoirs requires critical attitude to the given information and the check of its credibility using other sources.
   Even taken collectively, the published memoirs are not a sufficiently reliable source base for obtaining an objective picture of Kolchak's coup at all stages of its realization exclusively on the that basis. To solve this task, it is necessary to use all the complex of published sources as well as to continue a search for new documents in Russian and foreign archive depositories.

DE empire; imperialism; globalization; center-periphery; world-system;
   center of power; superpower; hyperpower
ID HEGEMONY
AB The article deals with the problems associated with the actualization of the empire theme in contemporary political studies with reference to current political processes. The empire is explored as a concept of political science and as a notion. The term "empire" denotes a special type of state that has universalist political claims and a structure of political institutions that ensures the concentration of power and its resources. The concept of "empire" is characterized by negative connotations, as well as ambiguity of interpretations as applied to the present. Two main interpretations of the empire are considered: the ideocratic and the center-peripheral one. The methodological limitations associated with attempts to apply them in the analysis of modern political institutions are shown. Thus, the application of center-peripheral approach leads to the erosion of the picture of center itself, as a subject of politics and management. The ideocratic interpretation of the concept "empire" is limited by modern trends of the de-ideologization of the state. In American political science the concept of "empire" is actualized in connection with attempts to advocate the role of the U.S. in post-bipolar world politics, their attempts to establish the world hegemony. At the same time, the concept of "empire" is actually replaced by the established categorical apparatus for the study of international relations and is intended to emphasize the unique, in the opinion of foreign researchers, nature of U.S. domination. In other interpretations of modern imperialism, it is identified with the great power and is used to characterize a number of modern states and their alliances. In the article, conclusions are drawn about the serious theoretical and methodological difficulties of interpreting the empire as a concept of modern politics, connected not only with the complexity of the empire phenomenon itself, but also with the fact that the attempts considered are based on the concept of empires of the era of imperialism, a special period characterized by domination states-empires. It seems promising to consider the " empire" as a type of conceptualization of policy based on specific political interests, and its implementation is possible in the event of legitimization of its imperial nature.

AB In the current post-truth culture, the problem of reliable reflection of socio-political reality in the public consciousness is topical. Widespread dissemination of false, fake news is a threat to society and democracy. The term "post-truth" is ambiguously defined in scientific, journalistic circles, among politicians and public figures. The post-truth politics is reflected in the international arena, in conflicts between countries, as well as at the regional level in the battle for the votes. The post-truth culture spreads widely on the Internet, creating a non-alternative personalized "world of truth" for the user. Fake news is gradually becoming a source of concern for the authorities of many states, threatening their internal security and destabilizing international democratic order. Average citizen might hardly tell false information from truth. Information can undermine public trust of citizens and cause widespread protest activity against authorities and democratic values, discrediting both professional journalists, politicians, and the power structures. The fight against false sources of information in the electronic and digital field is gaining momentum. In order to prevent the spread of the post-truth culture, a number of countries have chosen a strategy for strengthening censorship and introducing control over information posted in various media. This way can lead to infringement on civic rights and freedoms, threat to democracy and emergence of authoritarian regimes. Another strategy is to consolidate efforts of civil society, state, means and sources of information dissemination and companies engaged in digital technologies. This - in sum - contributes to the fight against the post-truth culture.

DT Article
DE medieval Rus'; identity; ethnicity; Old Russian annals and chronicles
AB In the article the author studies the identity that was referred to by the name rus' in the earliest chronicles of Kievan Rus'. The analysis is based on the ideas and reconstructions of Alexei A. Shakhmatov, who proved that the famous Tale of Bygone Years (1100s) had included some earlier chronicle or annalistic texts composed in the 11th century. According to Shakhmatov, the Tale originated from the so-called "Initial Composition" written in Kiev in the 1090s. The author shows that the writer or writers of the "Composition" placed Rus' in the world history according to the eschatological schemes of Byzantine chronicles. They understood Rus' as a Christian people and as a powerful state, and tried to "expand" its identity over local communities. The earlier texts, which can be dated back to the mid-11th century, considered Rus' in a different way: their authors' efforts were to specify its identity in relation to other ethnic or political groups, stressing its military victories and ignoring religious boundaries. The author of the article concludes that the intellectuals of Kievan Rus' were able to propose a variety of distinct "strategies of identification" and "ethnic projects".

DT Article
DE expert community; models of interaction between experts and government;
   citizen responsibility; policy decision
AB The article considers the main models of interaction between the authorities and the expert community, as well as the conditions for maintaining civil responsibility of experts. The text is based both on the results of previous studies and on the materials of 15 semi-structured interviews with experts conducted in the spring of 2017 in Moscow and St. Petersburg, most of which have experience of responsible work in federal or regional government bodies or interaction with international organizations, as well as academic work in universities or NGOs. Expert interviews were analyzed with the method of the "categorical content analysis scheme" and the QDA Miner Light program. Based on the criterion of the main affiliation (or lack thereof) and the degree of remoteness from the high authority, six categories of experts are identified that are involved both in the processes of politics - the struggle for the conquest or retention of power, and the process of policy - preparing and adopting political and managerial decisions. Along with the previously shown models of interaction between experts and authorities a linear autonomous model, a model of virtuous intelligence and a model of "prepaid result", the author suggests the fourth one, the model of initiative expertise, within which projects of political and managerial decisions are developed without the participation of executive power. It is shown that a certain level of civil responsibility of experts can be supported by the corporate ethics of the expert community, the development of which is promoted by professional expert associations.

Ideology easily penetrates not only into philosophy but into contemporary economy, science, education, art, mass media as well. In order to achieve the interdisciplinary understanding of ideology in its history, including reflection on the modern forms of social influence, it was decided to unite efforts of the specialists from different fields in a "round table" discussion. The idea of the discussion was to present and possibly systemize a range of conceptual and methodological approaches to overcome the narrow political understanding of ideology. The "round table" discussion held on the 1" of March, 2018 in the Institute of Philosophy showed that mobility and diversity of ideology as a social phenomenon correspond to a highly dynamic contemporary social reality. That is why it is so important to unite efforts of the researchers from different areas of knowledge in order to prevent transformations of a relatively intelligible and open for possible interaction ideology into a purely repressive one.

DT Article
DE political regime; Russian politics; stateness; statehood; ideology;
   pastiche; stability
AB This study examines the widespread thesis of recent years of the "strengthening" of the Russian state, perceived as improving its solvency, increasing stability, order, and strength in the period after the year 2000. These views are analyzed on the basis of scientific ideas about the state's potential, and its order and stability. In considering the domestic case and determining the numerous circumstances preventing a solidarity with political declarations, the author makes a conclusion about the imitative nature of the achieved "political stability" and the "strengthening" allegedly occurring in recent decades. In the author's opinion, the dynamics of economic development, internal structural contradictions and serious discursive problems determined the expansion, not the strengthening of the state system that hampered the formation of an effective and efficient decision-making system in the political process and of public policy. The author examines various options for the presence of both strengths and weaknesses in the state structure, as well as situations where it is difficult to make an unambiguous conclusion about state consistency and what the state is. The question remains whether the state is a competent management center, a disjointed set of rival institutions, or a predator which monopolizes public resources. Concerning Russian realities and discussing hypotheses about the "predatory" and "fragmented" nature of statehood based on the works of D. North, P. Evans, M. Mann, and E. Jenne, the author remarks on the main problems faced by the continuation of the previous line of political development and the public representation of the state system. These problems include the deterioration of the foreign policy situation, the serious contraction of resources available to the regime, and the divergence within the political elite.

SO QUAESTIO ROSSICA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE mid-19th-century Russian history; power and society; social dialogue;
   serfdom; communicative practice; projects of reforms
AB This article puts forward a research model for studying the interaction between power structures and Russian subjects in the first quarter of the 19th century. The starting point of the model is a revision of the structuralist approach. The author considers it important to study "social dialogue" as a history of the communicative practices emerging among Russian subjects, local representatives of power, and high-ranking officials of the imperial administration. In order to reconstruct the channels, content, and results of this "social dialogue", the author uses two groups of primary sources: texts produced in the process of public communication with an unspecified addressee that created a general intellectual and emotional context for the perception of existing social, economic, and political issues; and texts of public communication with a specified addressee, aimed at official structures of different levels with the purpose of solving certain practical problems. The author compares publications of Russian journals discussing the problem of "slavery" in different countries of the world, archival materials from the Russian State Historical Archive on "the issues connected with peasants' appeals for emancipation from non-noble masters", the serf-owners' complaints about the "illegal" emancipation of peasants without proper compensation, and projects for the abolition of serfdom created on the basis of the generalisation of complaints and petitions. The author distinguishes the two models of social dialogue, i.e. the conflict model and the project model. Taken together, these two models make it possible to trace both the government's reaction to amendments of existing laws meant to solve conflicts between serfs and their masters and efforts to develop an all-Russian solution for the issue of serfdom.

LA English
DT Article
DE BRICS; philosophy of law; theory of justice; legal integration; regional
   cooperation
AB This article assesses the problems and prospects of the development of cooperation among the BRICS countries' in the sphere of law and the movement of these countries towards the creation of a common legal framework. The article presents a comparative analysis of the systems of law, including the cultural, historical, social and political contexts of their formation and development as well as the functioning of the systems in the conditions of the modern world.
   The article particularly focuses on the subject of a common philosophy of law for the BRICS countries that would allow not only to establish the interaction of such dissimilar partners in the legal sphere, but also to move towards a new model of legal interaction for the whole world that has embarked on the path of globalization. Special means allowing the assessment of the possibility of future legal integration and globalization based on a common philosophy of law are the traditions and values of the civilizations represented by the BRICS countries. The article suggests that the core of the civilizational and value-based identity of each BRICS partner consists in a set of ideas and interpretations of the notion of justice clearly manifested in the controversy with the theory and ideology of justice proposed by the initiators and leaders of globalization - the countries of the West led by the United States. The theory and ideology of justice promoted by the "Atlantists" is concisely formulated in the book "A Theory of Justice" by John Rawls. Therefore, the reaction to and discussion of such a theory by the philosophers and jurists from Russia, India and China allows determining the contours of the common philosophical and legal position of these countries as well as outlining its significance for the future of the BRICS countries and, perhaps, of the whole system of legal relations in a new globalizing world.

AB The article presents the results of the sociological studies of the interethnic relations in the Arkhangelsk region and the Nenets Autonomous District, that are a part of the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation. We held an opinion poll and identified a statistically significant group of respondents that negatively evaluated the state of international relations, as well as the prevalence of a stable negative attitude towards the certain ethnic minorities in the population. The mass survey was supplemented by the materials of the series of expert interviews and statistical data. Comparison and interpretation of empirical values have led to the conclusion about the absence of socio-economic, demographic and cultural preconditions for the growth of ethnic tensions in the study area and about the negative assessments among the part of the population in respect of certain ethnic groups that have been based on the discursive reproduced ethnic hetero-stereotypes. The academic community should promote a rethinking of the idea of ethnic and cultural diversity among the political establishment and the related mass media by offering a conceptual alternative to the idea of the rigid differentiation of the population on the basis of the culturally distinctive features, when every citizen should clearly and permanently identify their ethnicity.

TI 'DOUBLETHINK' AND SEMIOTICS OF POLITICAL DISCOURSE

LA Russian
DT Article
DE semantics; semiotics; political discourse; Orwell; 1984; doublethink;
   doublespeak; social reality; language as a political instrument;
   possible world semantics
AB The interdependence between language and mind inevitably causes to clarify the question - how it is possible to control thought through language. The Orwellian "doublethink" is one of such means, which is usually associated with intentional distortion of reality for some political purposes. It is shown that doublethink is the hypertrophic development of the essential semiotic characteristics of political discourse (multiple reference, implicit modality, domination of pragmatic factors over semantic, combination of prescriptive and descriptive features), which can also be accompanied by their purposeful abuse. Doublethink is a complex phenomenon that shares common features with 1) false statement; 2) paradox, oxymoron or contradiction; 3) euphemism, metaphor, poetic utterance, polysemy, enantiosemy. Orwell pointed out the dominant feature of doublethink: with the all semantic operations, "the lie always one leap ahead of the truth". In the case of doublethink semiotic entities are exclusively used as referents. With the increasing of the rank of semantic interpretation all the statements (including the true ones) refer not to the world, but to the previous contexts and interpretations. "Even in using the word doublethink, it is necessary to exercise doublethink". Reality is not denied - it is re-interpreted, re-placed and became opaque for reference. Verification can be achieved by changing the nature of the secondary semiosis - through transition from connotation to metasemiosis. Metalanguage operations under "doublespeak" utterances act as its "illocutionary killing": it becomes a signifier for a new sign in the actual world.

AB The article examines the impact of the political crisis between Russia and Ukraine on the development and interaction of the regions of the Russian-Ukrainian borderlands. The backgrounds that lead to the political conflict between the two states are briefly analyzed. Changes in socioeconomic indicators of the neighboring regions are evaluated, as well as the state of cross-border interactions and adaptation of the economy and social sphere to the changed conditions in five key areas. It was established that the gradients between the neighboring regions in all parts of the Russian-Ukrainian borderland increased significantly. The sharpest gradients in 2016 were identified on the border sections between the Belgorod and Kharkov regions, Rostov and Donetsk regions. At the same time, economic and social interactions, though weakened, do not cease completely and retain the potential opportunity for restoring cooperation, given favorable conditions arise.

DE surprise exam puzzle; epistemic state; knowledge; logic; reasoning;
   paradox; Quine
AB In the paper, the puzzle known as the 'surprise exam paradox' is examined. The puzzle is generated by the following story: A student was told that the following week, from Monday to Friday, she was going to get an exam and that a day before the exam she would not know that the next day would be the exam day. The student observed that if the exam was going to take place on Friday she would know that Thursday night, so she concluded that Friday was not suitable for the exam. By analogous reasons she also excluded all days from Monday to Thursday and came to believe that there would be no exam at all the following week. But on Monday the exam took place, and since that was a surprise for the student, we can observe that the exam was held in perfect accordance with the initial announcement. The puzzle is generated by the fact that the student's reasoning seems to be quite sound whereas its conclusion turns out to be wrong. The author proposes a solution to the puzzle close to the one offered by Quine but differing from it in an important respect. The author agrees with Quine in the point that the student should not exclude any day from the period suitable for the exam. The author's solution differs from Quine's: he explains this by showing that the student's reasoning affected her epistemic state, and that the student should have taken this into account (but failed to do it). Thus, in the author's solution, the dynamics of the student's epistemic states plays a crucial role. The author demonstrates that the seeming paradox is generated by the following circumstances: 1. The student's reasoning was dependent on her epistemic states. 2. In the course of the reasoning, her epistemic state was substantially changed. 3. This change nullified the justification of the conclusion she came to. 4. In the traditional version of the story, the third point was not noticed by the student, which brought about a wrong expectation on her side. That point seems not to be noticed by the authors of some solutions to the puzzle either. The author of the paper also shows that the puzzle in question differs from logical paradoxes in the fact that a non-logical factor - the causal link between reasoning performed by the agent and her epistemic states - plays an essential role in it.

DE inferentialism; bilateralism; semantic paradox
AB The authors of this paper consider a new approach to the notion of truth and to the solution of semantic paradoxes suggested by David Ripley - a contemporary Australian logician and philosopher. The object of the paper is a critical analysis of the logical conception of Ripley and an elicitation of substantial features of his approach to the solution of the paradox problem. Ripley suggests an inferentialist and bilateralist approach to the solution of semantic paradoxes underlying in works of Ian Rumfitt, Greg Restall and Robert Brandom. Bilateralism as a particular form of inferentialism states that a meaning of a sentence depends on validity of its inferences based in terms of conditions of assertion and denial. Bilateralism and inferentialism are influenced by the coherent theory of truth as it opposites denotationalism which is based on the traditional correspondence view. Ripley changes the classical first-order logic by eliminating the rule of cut and adding the predicate of transparent truth but keeping all other axioms of the classical logical system. He considers that paradoxes are such sentences that cannot be either asserted or denied; as a bilateralist, Ripley argues that one should consider some sentences as paradoxes only if we have extra information about elements of the sentence: some paradoxes might not be considered as ones. He proposes two distinct ways of solving paradoxes - strict and tolerant approaches. The difference between these two ways is that if we choose the tolerant way, we can either assert or deny a paradox and if we choose the strict one, we must estimate paradoxes as senseless sentences. The question is how we are able to deal with semantic paradoxes if we cannot actually solve them: Ripley's approach supposes at least a more suitable way to deal with paradoxes considering their contradictional nature. The authors of the paper drew a conclusion that Ripley's inferentialist approach is one of possible ways of solving semantic paradoxes.

AB In the history of the Latin American's Communist movement, the 3rd Conference of the Communist Parties of Latin America, which took place in 1935, remains a field to be explored. Destined to be a political event that would conclude the policies and dogmas of the "third period" and mark the beginning of changes of the Comintern towards the policy of the Popular Front, based on its results it could not justify in the eyes of the directors of the International the role that had been assigned to it: elaborate new tactics for the parties of the region and prepare the historical resolutions of the VII Congress of the Comintern. The open and reserved resistances of the Latin American communist leaders contradicted the new line of the International, conditioning the oblivion and omission of this conference in the official history of the Comintern. The cominternian bureaucracy of the regional apparatus and consequently of the Argentine Communist Party, threatened by national parties with greater autonomy, offered a strong resistance to the Popular Front. This article is dedicated to this little-known episode of the Comintern history in Latin America.

DT Article
DE CSTO; Russia; CIS countries; security
AB The paper focuses on the history of the emergence and functioning of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), a military-political alliance initiated by Russia in the early 2000s. Nowadays the alliance unites Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Initially, the CSTO was meant to become a key instrument of maintaining stability and providing security in the CIS space and to consolidate Russia's positions as a coordinator of member-states' foreign policies in the post-Soviet space. The authors point out the main stages of the CSTO's evolution and evaluate its role in the interstate relations in the post-Soviet space. Accordingly, the paper focuses on the CSTO's normative framework and member states' expectations from the alliance. The authors argue that the CSTO can be conceptualized as a so-called dead letter regime, an international regime marked with a high formalization of its normative framework combined with low expectations of relevant actors that the established norms would really be followed. Essentially, the participating countries do not need the CSTO for the pursuit of their strategic objectives, though the Organisation performs some residual functions in Central Asia. Thus, stagnation remains CSTO's most likely perspective.

TI "POLTAVA SYNDROME" OF SWEDEN: BURDENSOME POLITICO-HISTORICAL LEGACY
SO MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Sweden; Russia; Europe; political syndrome; national identity; social
   consciousness; historical memory
AB In the article, the author examines the transformation of an old historical trauma-the "Poltava syndrome"-as a compound complex of political Russophobia, comprised of socio-cultural fears, politico-psychological collective stereotypes, offences, neuroses and aberrations of mass consciousness in modern Sweden. A composite set of combinations of anxious sensations, fears, challenges and threats is an element of social-psychological, culture-historical identity of the Swedes, a factor of social life, a forced condition of the country's international political reality. The article also shows how some features of the historical "threat from the East" social perception did change the mass behavior in Sweden due to aggravation of the world political situation in the post-Crimean period. On the one hand, the " Poltava syndrome" is a distinctive defense mechanism as part of a unique socio-cultural identity of the country, and on the other, in the foreign policy, it plays the role of a security device for the whole sphere of national military-political system. Today, the action mechanism of the " Poltava syndrome" becomes an apparent example as follows: when it weakens, the " softening" of Swedish neutrality occurs, its erosion takes place. And, vice versa, when the "Russian threat" (danger from the East) grows, one may see the reinforcement of the " Poltava syndrome". With the escalation of international tension by reason of nervousness, the social-psychological anxiety increases, the defense consciousness intensifies, the surges of mass patriotism are in evidence, and the " negative" around Russia favors the growth of alarmist moods among the population, further militarization of the country's policy.

TI TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS AND ITS INFLUENCE ON SEMANTICS

   JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY SOCIOLOGY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE

DT Article
DE analitical philosophy; Wittgenstein; Tractatus; meaning; truth
   conditions; formal semantics
AB This paper discusses a recent idea proposed by A.L. Nikiforov that Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus did not have any impact on anyone who does not specialize in analytical philosophy. The author argues that Wittgenstein in his Tractatus proposed some ideas that had a major impact on one of the areas in contemporary linguistics, namely, formal semantics.
   The author considers three such ideas. This is the idea that a natural language can be analyzed by formal methods, the idea that the meaning of a sentence is its truth-conditions, and the idea of a state of affairs as a possible situation denoted by a simple sentence.
   Formal semantics is one of the major areas of modern linguistics. It is a separate disciplinary field, with its own journals, conferences, PhD dissertations, etc. There are three key philosophical ideas that were adopted by this discipline. The first is the idea of compositionality (Frege's principle): the meaning of a complex expression is built from the meanings of the expressions it is composed from and the way they are combined. The second is the idea that the meaning of an affirmative sentence is its truth conditions. The third idea is that there is no fundamental difference between formal languages of logic and natural languages.
   As the analysis of Wittgenstein's diaries shows, as well as the analysis of Tractatus itself, Wittgenstein was the first one who formulated the idea that the meaning of a sentence is its truth conditions. Thus, we can conclude that at least one idea proposed in Tractatus influenced a whole discipline outside of philosophy.
   In addition, an analysis of Wittgenstein's early work shows that his attitude to natural languages was different than the one expressed by Russell, who believed that natural languages are too imprecise and illogical and could not be analyzed by formal methods. Wittgenstein was the first one to suggest that any natural language is logical, that an illogical language is impossible.
   This paper also draws parallels between Wittgenstein's notion of state of affairs and the concept of a minimal possible situation in situational semantics. Although these concepts are not identical, there are certain similarities there. Wittgenstein has definitely influenced philosophers who worked on this notion after him. Later this idea was adopted by linguists.

TI FOREIGN POLICY OF THE PRESIDENT OF FRANCE E. MACRON: PRAGMATISM BEHIND

LA Russian
DT Article
DE France; Emmanuel Macron; French foreign policy; European Union; Donald
   Trump; Syria; Iran; Africa; China; French-Russian relations
AB Since E. Macron's accession to power, the foreign policy of France has begun to evolve. Although the sharp change did not occur in it owing to the proximity of ideological views of E. Macron and F. Hollande, some innovations could be noted. The most remarkable shift is the change of the Paris' foreign policy style. The new president being a more charismatic and energetic leader represents the younger generation and symbolizes a renewal of the French diplomacy, a kind of "revitalization" of the French policy in the world. Mr. Macron is a globalist president who demonstrates his readiness to defend not only French interests, but also the EU and common Western values. While his main efforts are aimed at the implementation of domestic reforms, foreign policy is to strengthen the president's positions within the country. As a supporter of multilateralism, E. Macron strongly endeavors to increase the role of France in various regions of the world intensifying relations with different countries (Russia, India, Australia), mediating in conflict situations (Middle East) and actively using multilateral formats (Africa). This way, such practice objectively brings the modern world closer to multipolarity. At the same time, the French president is ready for an active dialogue with the USA, China and Russia. In this case, the ideological, value aspect is shifted to the background, whereas pragmatism and "real politics" come out at first. Thus, E. Macron not only inscribes himself among the key leaders of the contemporary world, but also demonstrates flexibility and rejection of some dogmatism inherent to his predecessor. Euro-Atlantic rhetoric does not prevent the French president from having a "business approach" to solve a number of political problems, focusing on practical projects (Russia, China and Africa). Despite his willingness to negotiate with ambitious partners, E. Macron is ready to demonstrate force to confirm his aspirations when it is profitable for him. This is evidenced by his idea of the European Intervention Initiative, by his decisions to continue the military operation in Mali and to take part in the U. S. military action against Damascus in April 2018. The new appearance of the French foreign policy is designed to keep the place of the country among the great powers of the 21st century and to respond to new challenges while the current world order established after 1991 is apparently undergoing serious changes.

TI INDEPENDENCE OF CATALONIA: WHY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
SO MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Spain; Catalonia; independence; autonomy; referendum; elections;
   constitution
AB There are three main reasons why there is no chance for creating an independent state in Catalonia. The first one refers to the Spanish Constitution, the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia and acting legislation that definitely and unambiguously prohibit the secession and the referendum on independence. To overcome this legal deadlock Spanish political forces should agree on the way of constitutional reform moving towards federation, which is not the case. The second one is connected with the political situation in Spain where the minority government formed through the motion of no-confidence and headed by P. Sanchez lacks sufficient support from the parliament to deal with the acute political crisis in Catalonia. The Catalan crisis coincided with the crisis of the Spanish two-party political system. The situation in Catalonia itself is no less complicated as the three separatist parties victorious in recent elections have different approaches to many political and economical issues. The tidal reason is the lack of foreign support (mainly from the EU) to the idea of Catalan independence. In the case of secession Catalonia will lose its membership not only in the EU but in euro-zone, Shengen zone, NATO, WTO and even UN. Meanwhile, the Catalan problem has turned into the main threat to the security and territorial integrity of Spain. Full-scale negotiations between Madrid and Barcelona on the whole complex of accumulated problems of political, legal, economic, financial, cultural and linguistic nature are vitally important. These negotiations will undoubtedly be long and complicated and may theoretically lead to a revision of the autonomous statute in terms of expanding the financial autonomy of the region, which would greatly contribute to consolidation of the Catalan society and isolation of "irreconcilables". Inability of both sides to start negotiations and to abstain from unilateral actions, let alone to come to an agreement, show that the present crisis has no mutually acceptable solution in the short term. The new Spanish government will have to address the Catalan problem as its top priority.

AB The Black Sea is a unique maritime region of great strategic importance not only for regional states, but also for non-regional players-especially for the NATO countries. For the Russian Federation it is the maritime area of its Black Sea Fleet location, the exit of which into the Mediterranean Sea and further to the Atlantic Ocean lies through the Black Sea straits of the Bosporus and the Dardanelles. For NATO members which are constantly strengthening their naval presence here, it is not only a region of interaction with allies (Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey), but also a region for direct access to potential partners-Georgia and Ukraine, as well as a place for naval exercises, gathering intelligence information, and, in general, - the area of direct contact with Russia's naval potential under conditions of a new Cold War. This existing level of conflict in the region is aggravated by a number of other circumstances. Firstly, these are unresolved issues with the delimitation of maritime spaces: between Russia and Ukraine, the problem of which has only intensified after the entry of Crimea into the Russian Federation; between Russia and other Black Sea countries (Romania, Turkey, Abkhazia), also emerged after the Crimea's accession. Secondly, this is the nonrecognition of Russian zones of sovereignty and jurisdiction around the peninsula on the part of Kiev, and the filing of relevant lawsuits in international courts and arbitrations, which is hypothetically fraught with a growth of provocations in the waters adjacent to Crimea. Thirdly, this is a gradual aspiration of Turkey to strengthen the national level of regulation for navigation through the straits - the Bosporus and the Dardanelles. Finally, unrealized projects of the NATO's Black Sea flotilla only exacerbate the tension here. Whether Russia will fully ensure the protection of its national interests in the Black Sea region, will determine its status of the largest and the most powerful Black Sea state.

AB The problem of studying the personnel potential of various sectors of the economy is topical and permanent in its importance for ensuring sustainable functioning and consistent development of socioeconomic systems. At the same time, ensuring high rates of attracting highly qualified personnel to the agrarian sector of the economy and rational use of human resources in the interests of its dynamic innovative development requires constant diagnosis of the territory's personnel policy implemented and the identification of internal and external factors affecting its transformation. The purpose of the study is to examine the composition of workers of agricultural enterprises in the South of Russia, assess the shortage of cadres of mass professions and managers of agricultural enterprises in the region, identify factors that affect the changing human resources and form the personnel policy of economic entities in order to identify the potential need for specialties.The study uses methods of interviewing experts and questioning respondents. The authors have proposed an algorithm for revealing regularities and prospects for the formation of the human resources of territories, as well as an assessment of the factors affecting the personnel policy of agricultural enterprises in the South of Russia. The study has been concluded that the personnel situation in the region can be improved through active investment policies to create jobs, especially in sectors with excessive supply of personnel: real estate transactions, rental and provision of services and financial activities. Specialists in this field could find employment in science-intensive industries, for example, software development, scientific research in the field of chemistry, medicine, agriculture, and others.

DT Article
DE US; employment; workplaces; inequality; globalization
AB The promises of D. Trump to return jobs to the American workers put the problems of employment in the focus of his economic policy. After the Trump's first year in White house the job market feels nice with employment indicators growing and unemployment going down. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017) makes it more attractive to do business both for the American and foreign firms in the United States; and benefits those American companies that do their business at home. There is little doubt that lowering taxes, limiting regulation can reduce employer's costs, and stronger economic growth would increase employment opportunities. However, this process cannot stop long run trends of globalization; technological, demographic influence on the labor force participation, jobs polarization. The US economy has long been moving away from mining and manufacturing industries towards service sectors with less median wage and lower access to employer's benefits, to medical, pension and other programs. The paper focuses on job polarization with rising inequality between different groups of employees. The structure of employment in the US had sharply polarized over the past two decades by qualification, education; with expanding job opportunities, both for high-skill and low-skill occupations and decreasing opportunities for middle-skill workers. Meanwhile the tax cuts and regulation cuts are coming hand in hand with budget cuts for supporting education and training which could weaken the possibilities of low income persons to gain education and skills that the labor market values. So far, current administration's policy may deliver impulse for more jobs, coming with economic growth, but eventually the social bad political polarization of America may become deeper after Trump's presidency than before.

AB The article employs the analysis of the processes take place within the field of domestic politics in Poland in the aftermath of the parliamentary and presidential elections took place in 2015, which led J. Kaczynski's party "Law and Justice" to power. The party pursues a policy of somewhat "neoauthoritarian revanche" (as defined by I.S. Yazhborovskaya), manifested in taking control over democratic institutions, which meets roadblocks both in Poland and in the European Union. However, the opposition forces have failed to challenge the ruling party, which enjoys the favour with the electorate. The paper primarily focuses on the identification of severe weaknesses of the political opposition in Poland. It argues that one's backbone - liberal parties - is in a state of internal instability. The "Civic Platform" that had been ruling until 2015 needs to be due for political rejuvenation after the suffered defeat and the party leader Donald Tusk withdrawal to Brussels to take the helm in the European Council. The new leadership of the party headed By G. Schetyna achieved a substantial internal consolidation, yet it still lacks the means of restoring the tarnished credibility. Another liberal party, the "Modern (Nowoczesna)", upon which many people pinned fervent hopes in 2016, is now facing considerable challenges that mount apace since the party's leadership has changed and the struggle for political survival is underway. The article argues that the current difficulties the opposition parties run into are not only due to their organizational weaknesses, but also to the lack of an elaborated program that would coin the alternative ways of the country's overall development.

AB The article presents the concept of throughput legitimacy for the political system of the European Union. Throughput legitimacy was conceptualized by the American political scientist Vivien Schmidt in 2012. In Russian political science this concept was not widely used, despite its obvious practical applicability. The author aims to acquaint researchers of European integration to this concept and to show how productive its practical application for political analysis may be. The author refers to the republican and liberal traditions in European political philosophy, which are fundamental for legitimacy formulation. The methodology of the article lies in the system-based historical approach. Three features of the political system of the EU are explored, explaining the shift of the legitimacy balance in favour of the republican component. Based on D. Easton theory of political systems and functional theory of N. Luhmann, the author substantiates the thesis that the legitimacy of the political system consists of three components: input legitimacy, throughput legitimacy and output legitimacy. The author comes to the conclusion that in assessing the legitimacy of the EU political system, the concept of throughput legitimacy is the most adequate, since it takes into account the peculiar features of this system, reflects interrelations within the system, allows to estimate the quality of governance and to develop appropriate recommendations.

AB This article examines the legal foundations of the Eurasian Economic Union in the area of science, technologies and innovation in the context of the regional policy of transition to sustainable development and achieving its goals (Sustainable Development Goals/SDGs) as a new aspect of the phenomenon of Eurasian integration. The subject matter of the present study is the impact of SDGs on the EAEU legal policy of technological modernizing the economy. The article aims to ascertain the conformity of the EAEU law with solving the task of transition to sustainable development in the aspect of encouraging the development and transfer of ecologically sound technologies. For this purpose, the author has analyzed the provisions of the EAEU hard and soft law in detail. The research methods used in the study were both general (analysis, synthesis, abstracting and generalization) and specific (historical legal and comparative legal). The theoretical foundations were notions that the means to harmonize the three dimensions of development (social, economic and ecological) are to use relative technologies. Their development and transfer are in the focus of strategical documents concerning sustainable development, including the Agenda for Sustainable Development till 2030. Based on these scientific methods and a theoretical approach, the author has explored key sectoral work streams of the EAEU legal policy in the area of the development and transfer of the mentioned technologies, first of all, technologies in industry and agroindustry. Simultaneously, the institutional background of the Eurasian Technology Platforms and the Eurasian Network of Technology Transfer has been described. As stressed by the author, an essential component of the EAEU scientific and technological integration for sustainable development is collaboration with governments of third states, international organizations and states' regional integrative alliances. That is why, much attention is paid to the scientific and technological collaboration with other states and international organizations (FAO, UNIDO). The framework basis of this collaboration is essentially political rather than legal. Hence, the development of the legal foundations of this collaboration has prospects. The author proves the provision that the EAEU law provides for modernizing economy and society of member-states for the development and transfer of ecologically sound technologies to different branches of economy with the aim of forming a "Green Union". A conclusion is made that the technological modernization of the EAEU in ecocentric terms on the basis of ESTs demands: (1) synergy between all means of transition to sustainable development, in particular, technologies, investments, trade developing and fmancial resources accumulating; (2) deeper economic integration at the regional level and increase of economic and scientific and technological cooperation with third countries, their regional alliances and international organizations; (3) a coordinated ecological policy of member states, a developed regional ecological legislation, an elaborated regional strategy of sustainable development.

TI PRINCIPLES OF INSTRUMENTALIZATION OF THE "HISTORY OF CONCEPTS"
   METHODOLOGY IN THE STUDIES OF PUBLIC THOUGHT IN RUSSIA IN THE 18TH -

AB The paper deals with the important issues of implementation of methods of the history of concepts in the historical studies of public thought. The aim of the paper is to establish the principles of conducting a study of public thought with the use of methodological approaches of German and Cambridge schools of 'history of concepts' and Bakhtin's theory of speech genres. The paper also formulates the principles of contextuality, of system approach, of combining texts of public communication with specified and unspecified addressee, of thematic and genre variety of sources of historical study. The practical approbation of the aforementioned principles was based upon the study of a polemic in Russian periodicals of the early 19th century around N. I. Turgenev's "Experience in the Theory of Taxes:: a review of an anonymous author and Turgenev's response published in Syn Otechestva and Dukh zhurnalov in 1820. The central point of the polemic was the question about the ability of elective bodies of class representation, which were also seen as the essence of 'constitutional government', to provide adequate protection of civil rights. Turgenev, using England as an example, argued in favor of the elective system to increase personal freedom and property of citizens, while his anonymous opponent insisted that any elective bodies would be merely tools of bureaucratic deception chasing their own purposes. The comparison of interpretations, logical arguments and interconnections the participants of the discussion used while talking of 'liberty', 'law', 'constitution' and 'property' allows to discover the most important contexts of their practical use. The author shows that the anonymous critic of Turgenev's work envisaged `law' and 'liberty' in a broader moral, religious and legal context, including the well-known rhetorical tricks, like the counterposing of the negative French revolutionary experience to the positive Russian monarchical stability. Meanwhile, Turgenev, responding to the attack, emphasized the importance of legal protection of rights of elected representatives to participate in the discussion of issues of taxation and property. These functions of parliament, according to Turgenev, reflected the very essence of constitutional governance. The author makes a conclusion about the existence of strong connections between the concepts `law', 'property', `liberty' and 'constitution' in the Russian public thought of the early 19th century; such a connection could be used either to argue in favor of parliamentary innovations in Russian political practice, or to criticize them fiercely. The author also stresses that the proposed set of methodological principles of 'history of concepts' could be used rather productively to study the public discussion about the purposes and character of political modernization of the Modern Age.

AB The problem of the article can be formulated in the form of a question about how the concept of the status of cognitive activity in modern phenomenological hermeneutic philosophy changes? It is established that in the modern hermeneutic philosophy there is an ontologization of the communicative dimension. Language and communication are attributed the status of necessary conditions of cognition. Different aspects of the language dimension are articulated in different projects of modern hermeneutics. Thus, in formal pragmatics, the social function of language is articulated; communication appears as something that generates social matter and ensures the coordination of actions of all participants in one life world. In transcendental pragmatics, the epistemological aspect of language and communication is articulated; language is attributed a transcendental status in the Kantian sense, that is, it is a necessary condition for knowledge and the condition that ensures the acquisition of general knowledge. A phenomenological hermeneutic position allows us to combine the principles of validity and performative orientation in cognition, since it discovers structures that generate intersubjective significance of knowledge in communication. The structures cannot be identified from the position of a third person, that is, from the perspective of an external observer, because they are actualized only in the perspective of a participant in communicative interaction. In the phenomenological hermeneutic perspective, the basis for the universality and objectivity of cognition is the situation of communicative interaction. In the conditions of overcoming the idea of an autonomous transcendental subject, the concept of the essence of the process of cognition also changes. The opposition of the subject and the object is overcome; it is revealed that, firstly, our knowledge grows out of a certain "preconception" of the world, and, secondly, our essential belonging to it is a necessary condition for the very possibility of knowing the world. The importance of this transformation lies in the fact that these phenomena call into question traditional philosophical distinctions: for example, a distinction between the theoretical and the practical, which was based on the subject-object model of cognition. Our theoretical activity grows out of everyday practices and in one way or another is connected with the translation or transformation of the world of everyday life.

Furthermore, Japan is an important strategic ally of the United States, with whom Russia's relations are currently at their lowest point since the collapse of the Soviet Union. At the same time, mutual interest in economic cooperation has motivated Moscow and Tokyo to enter into serious negotiations in an attempt to overcome their political differences-differences that outside forces seek to exploit. Japan can help Russia avoid a one-sided economic dependence on China, but because of its ties to the United States and the territorial dispute with Russia, Japan cannot assume the same level of importance for Moscow as China holds.

ID EPISTEMOLOGY
AB The paper is part of the discussion initiated by Olga Stoliarova's article "Historical Ontology as a Problem", where she points out some crucial issues considering the future development of both historical epistemology and historical ontology. Following Stoliarova's general claim on problematizing historical ontology, the author is trying to deduce some main tendencies from the vast variety of discussions on the theoretical basis and status of historical epistemology and ontology. In this context, an epistemologist, in the author's opinion, has to deal with two main problems. First, it is the epistemology-ontology (metaphysical) link within the history of philosophy. The widely understood "classic epistemology" presupposes a universal rationality and a scientific methodology, meanwhile historical epistemology offers a non-classic relativization of the basic epistemological principles. In this sense, historical epistemology (at least in its French version) finds itself in the trend of epistemological movements of the 19th and 20th centuries such as positivism and logical empiricism drifting towards the elimination of metaphysics as a theoretical platform for epistemology. The second main issue for both historical epistemology and its stepchild, historical ontology, covers the explanation of the changes within scientific practice. Paying attention to the process of change within scientific concepts, methodological approaches and the very principles of scientific investigation, the philosopher finds herself in a situation, where a set of epistemological principles B took the place of a set of epistemological principles A, but the process of this change rests mysterious and unexplained. That is why it requires a different epistemological approach. Here the trend of the recent decades towards the return of ontology can be considered as a kind of a return of classical philosophy on a new theoretical level, where ontological principles often (though not always) become the theoretical basis for epistemological principles. Anyway, the next theoretical step in this debate belongs to epistemologists.

ID ACCESS
AB The article deals with the specific features of the medical care consumption phenomenon in the sociological discourse. The author focuses on theoretical and methodological backgrounds of a sociological understanding of medical care consumption strategies, and determines differentiation mechanisms of medical care consumption in the context of transformation of the healthcare institution in Russia today. The aim of the article is to create a theoretical approach to a complex assessment of the healthcare system accessibility. The novelty of this endeavor consists in the application of the sociological constructivism methodology to a consumer's behavior study in the health sphere. The possibility of integrating economic, organizational and socio-cultural dimensions for a better sociological understanding of inequality factors in healthcare is argued. The concept of medical care consumption is analyzed as a dynamic interaction of different variables, the interaction of actors in the medical system in a changing social context. Special attention is given to the analysis of behavioral and structural dimensions of medical care accessibility. Despite considerable efforts by the health authorities to promote legislative and regulatory innovations, achievements in this field are minor. The limitation of the modern concepts of differentiation in healthcare is connected with the reduction of social inequality to objective geographical and economic factors, although it should rather be about the intersection of external and internal barriers of inequality. The study of the differentiation in the sphere of medical care consumption is dominated by two approaches: personality and situational. Currently, there is a tendency of overcoming the cognitive one-sidedness of personality and situational approaches. In line with this trend, the social inequality of consumers is not regarded as the result of influence of the social situation or individual traits, social values, attitudes and cultural predispositions. The social differentiation of medical care consumption is seen primarily as a result of people's interpretation of the social situation of health problems and "attributing" values and meanings to it in the socio-cultural context of the health care system.

It describes the directional vectors of a coherent nature of the foreign policy of the two countries, as a result of which Moscow and Minsk are actively speaking with one or similar voices on the major international issues, working closely in the UN and other universal and regional organizations. The positive dynamics of the long-term strategic mutually beneficial nature of modern Russian-Belarusian cooperation is revealed, beginning in 1992, when the countries gained independence and began a sovereign path of development. It is emphasized that the integration of the russian and belarussian economies within the framework of the Union State is expanding and is in constant development. It has no analogues in other states of the post-Soviet space. Allies implement several dozen joint industry programs. Particular attention is paid to the creation of the latest high-tech products, stimulating business to actively introduce innovations in the real sector of the economies of Russia and Belarus.

   social-democrats; democratic socialism; reformism; left center;

AB The article is devoted to one of the main aspects of the left sector evolution in the political space of Western countries. Having arisen during the French Revolution of the 18th century, the division of political space into the left and the right spilled over to all countries of Europe and America. However, this division changed significantly hereafter under the influence of complicated social processes and turbulent political events. During the 20th century, radical left forces, primarily the Communists, have sustained a variety of defeats trying to eliminate the capitalist system. Social-Democratic parties have evolved from revolutionary positions to the increasingly moderate reformism. Consequently, in the Western Europe, the left forces have yielded the pas to center-left, social-reformist parties, the two-party (two-coalition) system has emerged where center-left and center-right replaced each other in power. In Latin America, the left forces survived, but even when they took power, they were bound to conduct a center-left policy. Yet the development of globalization in neo-liberal style, while intensifying the economic competition, greatly hampered the implementation of such policy. The time coincidence of the left and center-left parties' crushing defeats in most of the Western countries is not occasional, it witnesses the crisis in their course. Lately, the situation has been dramatized significantly by emergence of influential populist parties and movements in Europe, which put the previous division into question. The leftist crisis has violated the regular rotation of political forces in power and created a background for essential changes in political course and maybe also for weakening of stability of political institutions. This situation could only be altered by the change of the present, mostly neo-liberal character of globalization processes, which is highly unlikely.

The work content includes the discussion of the difficulties of developing rigorous theories of the evolution of state forms associated with the complexity and ambiguity of particular historical processes of state formation and development.
   The authors distinguish and consider the evolutionary features of the modern state, justify that the modern state as a historical type possesses a number of features that are not inherent ( or inherent only in part) in both the traditional and the proto-modern state, which form its evolutionary features, specificity of functioning and evolutionary transformation. In addition, the article identifies and analyzes four main innovative stages in the political and legal institutionalization of modern political domination: civil state, rule-of-law state, democratic rule-of-law state and social rule-of-law state.

AB The purpose of this study is to identify the special aspects of the information-psychological conflict between the parties to the conflict as a "hybrid war" element. The article deals with the content and scope of the information-psychological confrontation, carried out by both the main and indirect participants of the Syrian conflict. The degree of influence of the Syrian conflict on the positions, actions and methods of achieving the goals of the parties to the conflict is analyzed in this work. The methods of information influence, the possibility of their application and effectiveness in the conditions of changes in the positions of the parties to the conflict are shown in the research.
   Special attention is paid to the role of regional states (Saudi Arabia, Qatar) and Western countries (primarily the United States of America) in the information campaign in Syria, the media they use as part of a "hybrid war" to defend their interests and the interests of the oppositional groups they support. The article considers the features of the influence of information war on the positions of participants and their changes after the Russian Federation intervention in the conflict, which has become the object of a powerful information confrontation.
   To analyze the problem a structural-functional approach as well as a comparative method and case study were used.
   As a result of the conducted research the authors came to the conclusion that the influence of the "hybrid war" in the aspect of information-psychological confrontation on the positions of the parties to the conflict, their actions against each other, methods and ways of defending their own interests can not be questioned.
   Moreover the individual elements of the information war used by both the main and indirect participants in the Syrian confrontation or their combination significantly complicate the processes of political settlement of the conflict, because under their influence the positions of the parties that are able to stop the bloodshed become diametrically opposed or completely antagonistic.

AB The attitude towards migrants of different ethnicity is an urgent problem for most countries due to the scale of external migration. The results of the analysis of the degree of tolerance to migrants can be influenced by the lack of understanding of the complex structure of the attitude, because it consists of several components, the content and essence of which are insufficiently studied. In Western and Russian scientific literature there is no unity of opinion about the conditions and factors that determine the attitude to migrants of different ethnicity. In May 2016, the authors of the article conducted a questionnaire survey on a representative sample of 485 residents of Yekaterinburg, living in this city for more than five years. The selection of respondents was made in accordance with the quota sample by sex, age and areas of residence in Yekaterinburg. The authors were interested in the attitude towards migrants of different ethnicity from Central Asian countries (Kazakhs, Kirghizs, Tadzhiks, Uzbeks, Turkmens). The attitude to migrants was measured using different scales. For example, the application of the social distance scale developed by Emory Bogardus showed that ethnic Kazakhs are perceived by the inhabitants of Yekaterinburg as a more socially close ethnic group than migrants of different ethnicity from other Central Asian countries. The analysis of the influence of national and religious affiliation, education, as well as socio-demographic characteristics on the attitude of migrants of different ethnicity, revealed the absence of statistical correlations. Using factor analysis the authors were able to analyse the attitudes revealing the position of the residents of Yekaterinburg relative to migrants. This is the recognition of the acceptability of belonging to the same social community with migrants, the degree of benevolence for the stay of migrants in the city and focus on optimising the interaction of local population and migrants. It is possible to talk about the existence of fundamentally different attitudes presented in the form of three latent variables and its relation to national cultural attitudes and real practices in the field of relations with migrants. It was shown that the attitude of the receiving community towards migrants of different ethnicity is influenced not by the sociodemographic characteristics of the residents of Yekaterinburg, but by their national-cultural and behavioural characteristics: the attitude to their own nationality and culture, as well as the experience of interaction with migrants.

AB The article researches the trends of international capital movement in general and in the leading economies in the current decade. Besides advanced economies, the article considers BRICS, CIS and EEU states as well as offshores. It is argued that while the capital flows (likewise international trade, labor migration and knowledge exchange) are forming the future of the world economy, the current stance and future of the leading world economies basically determine the volumes and distribution of the capital flows. This asymmetrical interdependence of the dynamics of international capital flows and world economy is researched on the basis of available current examples. The forecast is made that in the coming years the growth of volumes of international capital flows is questionable. Anyway, the share of emerging economies will be increasing, especially at the expense of BRICS countries (particularly China). The article also forecasts that US role in international capital inflow would be positively impacted by US tax reform, on the one hand, and negatively touched by US political instability, on the other hand. It is noted that in spite of Brexit and the failure of Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership project, the principal partners of the EU countries in the sphere of international capital flows remain the UK and USA. The developed Asian countries will retain their position of net capital exporters. As for CIS countries, foreign capital inflows will be shifting to such countries as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Azerbaijan, while the share of Russia in FDI inflows will be decreasing.

AB One of the important conditions for an effective implementation of the Federal Project "Assistance in Raising the Level of Financial Literacy of the Population and Developing Financial Education in the Russian Federation" is the targeting of its programmes. Federal events are held in more than 40 regions of Russia; in 9 regions the regional programmes have been approved. The lack of data that would make it possible to characterise the financial literacy of the population in most regions of the Russian Federation is a serious obstacle to the impact of the project and its efficiency assessment. The problem of the authors' research is the question of the effectiveness of activities carried out without considering the existing differentiation of Russian regions in terms of socio-economic development. The research hypothesis consists in the following: there are regional differences in the financial practices and attitudes of the population. To test the hypothesis an inter-regional comparative study was implemented. The geography of the research is represented by three major cities: Volgograd, Omsk and Tyumen. The cities are differentiated according to two criteria: the income level of the population and the availability of regional programmes to improve the financial literacy of the population. The object of the research is the financial literacy of full-time students of higher education. The subject of the research is their financial attitude and practices. Students are not chosen randomly. They are the target group of the Federal Project and, therefore, the question of targeting programmes is also of great importance. In the data obtained as a result of the study, regional differences in the financial practices and attitudes of students were recorded. Volgograd students are more responsible in accounting for current expenses and incomes, more circumspectly in relation to loans. Students of Omsk are less responsible in planning their budget, less often they realise the importance of savings. The authors emphasise that the income level in these regions differs slightly, but the financial culture is different. The incomes of Tyumen residents are 1.5 times higher than in Volgograd and Omsk, while students indicate longer horizons for personal finance planning and are more likely to approve loans. The revealed peculiarities of financial behaviour and financial culture make it possible to substantiate the thesis that planning and implementing the activities of the project "Assistance in Raising the Level of Financial Literacy of the Population and Developing Financial Education in the Russian Federation" at the level of a particular region should ensure targeting. It is necessary to have a clear idea of the level of the financial literacy of the population of this region. Monitoring sociological research will allow: 1) to plan events correctly; 2) to assess their effectiveness; 3) to provide "feedback", i.e., provide information necessary to adjust and improve the effectiveness of these activities.

DT Editorial Material
DE pragmatism; Peirce's maxim; the fact/value dichotomy; doubt; belief
AB The writings of Hilary and Ruth Anna Putnam, collected by David Macarthur for Harvard UP, invite us to take a fresh look at the history of American pragmatism. William James and John Dewey are viewed as paradigmatic pragmatists, the only true representatives of the tradition. It is widely believed that James played a secondary though, no doubt, practically important role in the development of pragmatism. The Putnams disagree: William James can be rightly considered to be a co-founder of the pragmatist school. In his debut article published in The Journal of Speculative Philosophy in 1878, James acutely criticises Spencer's positivism. The naive-realistic model of cognition as representation (the spectator's point of view) is contrasted here with the idea of interaction with reality through its study and adaptation (the agent point of view). James's "knower" does not passively register facts and ready-made truths, reflecting an order he comes upon and finds simply existing, but "creates" truths. In apprehending the world, we change it. For pragmatists, human experience is never "neutral": verification and valuation are "interdependent". In the Putnams' reconstruction, Dewey and James were mainly concerned with rectification and adaptation of Peirce's ideas. The key concept of Peircean pragmati(ci)sm, "doubt", transforms in Dewey's writings into a "problematic" (existentially uncertain) situation, and "belief" with its psychological and possibly relativistic connotations is replaced by "war-ranted assertion". It is not the perceiver's state of mind, R.A. Putnam says, but the situation itself that is problematic. A true hypothesis is like the key that fits a lock; it enables us to move from an indeterminate situation into one that is determinate, not from feeling of doubt to feeling of certainty. Dewey and James were fallibilists, but certainly not skeptics. According to classicopragmatism, any of our hypotheses can be refuted, and expectations frustrated, but that is no reason to suspend all belief, or to refuse to use the term "true". Doubts require justification just as much as beliefs. That one can be both fallibilistic and anti-skeptical is "the basic insight" of American pragmatism, the Putnams suggest.

ID RUSSIAN ECONOMY; SUSTAINABILITY; MIRROR
AB The development of the system paradigm in economic science leads to the formulation of a number of important questions to the political economy as one of the basic directions of economic theory. In this article, on the basis of system introspection, three questions are considered. The first is the relevance of the class approach to the structuring of the socio-economic space; the second is the feasibility of revising the notion of property in the modern world; the third is the validity of the notion of changing formations as the sequence of "slave-owning system - feudal system - capitalist system". It is shown that in modern society the system approach to the structuring of socio-economic space is more relevant than the class one. Today the classical notion of "property" does not reflect the diversity of production and economic relations in society and should be replaced by the notion of "system property", which provides a significant expansion of the concepts of "subject of property" and "object of property". The change of social formations along with the linear component has a more influential cyclic constituent and obeys the system-wide cyclic regularity that reflects the four-cycle sequence of the dominance of one of the subsystems of the macrosystem: project, object, environment and process.

DE Hegel's philosophy; soul; method of scientific psychology;
   cultural-historical psychology
AB The article deals with the problem of Hegel's place in the history of psychology based on the analysis of Chapter V of his Phenomenology of Spirit. The author tries to demonstrate that the identification of Hegel's psychological conception with the doctrine of the Subjective Spirit in the Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences is wrong, because it is in the Phenomenology of Spirit that the philosopher reveals the prerequisites for the formation of the concept of soul in the "experience of consciousness" and carries out a thorough criticism of contemporary psychology. According to Hegel, the emergence of the concept of soul is associated with the attempt of "observing reason" to reveal the "inner" of the organic and to attribute to it a stable existence by analogy with objects of inanimate nature. However, actual experience disproves these attempts. The concept of soul arises in it, but immediately opens the inaccessibility of "soul" for "observing reason". Thus, Hegel reveals the lack of reality in the central concept of philosophical psychology. The author claims that this way Hegel makes a decisive step from the former metaphysical theory about soul to the creation of the new model of psychology. The result of the "experience of consciousness" is the awareness of the inevitability of abandoning the dead-end approaches of the former psychology and the transition to the analysis of an individual's activity in the social context as a productive method of cognition of mental phenomena. In the following sections of Chapter V, Hegel demonstrates that the nature of individuality is revealed in activity, and not in some supposedly inherent invariable attributes, and this activity can be carried out only in a social context. Hegel's demonstration of the impossibility of knowing individuality outside of its activities prompts to recognise his approach to those searches that were conducted in the Russian psychology of the 20th century (Lev Vygotsky and his followers). The author argues the idea that Hegel's views can be considered as the first attempt to develop a method of scientific psychology.

The author gives the description of staff readiness sociological assessment methodology to prevent confidential data leakage. The author's methodology is based on the results of corporation information security management sociological support. It means providing top managers (or information security staff) with relevant generalised and systematised information required to make management decisions based on the results of corporate employees sociological examination. The personality social core model for information security staff was developed. The levels of social readiness, social competence and social compatibility are normalised, which makes it possible to correlate the assessed candidate to a specific subtype from 27 hypothetically possible ones. The author's research allows stating that assessing a person's social core formation level makes it possible to permit a specific employee or candidate to work at an information security unit. The proposed author's methodology provides decision-makers with tools for personnel diagnostics and assesses potential applicants or employees from information security staff.

AB The article considers the theoretical foundations of constitutional representation as a legal institution, issues of identification of political representation in the modem science of constitutional law, the correlation of methodological and normative bases of public political representation in constitutional jurisprudence and issues of improving constitutional representation in the political and legal practice of Russia. The author explores the problem of legal identification of constitutional representation, demonstrates the relationship between constitutional democracy and "people's representation", "representation in constitutional law", the "right to people's representation". He discusses the scientific approaches to understanding the nature and features of public political representation established by the Constitution of the Russian Federation in 1993. This article substantiates the scientific and legal-political significance of the concept of constitutional representation for the development and improvement of various forms of public political representation in Russia, examines the influence of the theory of Republicanism on the system of public political representation, the prospects for the formation of multi-level Constitutionalism in Russian jurisprudence and the practice of territorial organization of the state. The concept of constitutional representation (as a legal institution) is designed to explain the possibilities for expanding the political participation of citizens at the federal, regional and municipal levels of the organization of public authority, as well as to reveal the forms of public political representation in the territorial structure of the Russian state. The article uses the methods of comparative and systemic analysis, the method of constitutional design, concrete historical and formal legal methods of analysis. The author uncovers gaps and shortcomings in the current legislation in the sphere of constitutional representation and formulates the provisions for the improvement of constitutional legislation. Particular attention is paid to the dynamic possibilities, realities and prospects of the implementation of the right to constitutional representation as a guarantee of the implementation of the principle of people's sovereignty, not only at the federal level, but also at the regional and municipal levels of the organization of public power. The study analyzes the theoretical basis, the origins of constitutional representation as well as the problem of the implementation of the forms of public political representation in Russia as the basis of the constitutional order of Russia.

AB Konstantin Paustovsky was educated in the First Kiev Gymnasium, which in the years of his studies was renamed the Aleksandrovskaya Kiev Gymnasium. It was one of the most famous educational institutions of Russia, which existed for more than 100 years. Paustovsky entered the gymnasium on the second attempt, having failed in the competition the first time. The article describes the exam programs that the future writer withstood when entering the gymnasium. To be enrolled not only in the first, but also in the preparatory class, it was necessary to successfully withstand serious tests. According to the Law of God, boys who entered the first class had to know the 10 main prayers, the Symbol of Faith, the Ten Commandments, the most important events of the sacred history of the Old and New Testaments. To successfully pass the exam in Russian, it was required to read fluently in Russian and to be able to retell small read stories, write dictations, and read Church Slavonic. It was also necessary to know by heart at least 10 poems and fables and to expressively read them. The requirements for arithmetic included the ability to add, subtract, divide and multiply within 100 orally, up to one million in writing. The article reveals the characters and biographies of the teachers of the gymnasium, of which Paustovsky wrote in "The Story of Life". Various documentary sources are used to clarify the essential facts of the biographies of the teachers. In turn, the biographical work of Paustovsky allows recreating the details of studies in the Kiev Gymnasium. In the article, considerable attention is paid to libraries that worked in the gymnasium; they were regularly replenished with new publications, including works of belles-lettres by classics and contemporary authors. It is known that Paustovsky used not only the gymnasium library, but also the city library. It was during the years of study in the gymnasium that the circle of reading of the future writer, the basis of his characteristic figurative system, was formed. In this, a considerable role was played by the textbooks on which he studied, including the Law of God, the Russian language, arithmetic, algebra, geometry, geography, natural science, Latin, French and German. The knowledge gained in the gymnasium largely determined Paustovsky's interest in Russian and foreign literature, history, the surrounding natural world, and contributed to the expansion of his horizons. Representatives of different confessions, estates, nationalities studied at the Kiev Gymnasium, friendly dialogue with them, discussion of both aesthetic and political issues shaped the world outlook and the creative personality of the writer.

AB Europe was and remains the main direction of Germany's foreign policy. The new coalition government continues to focus on the European vector. At its center is the European Union and the Eurozone, in which the FRG retains the informal role of political and economic leader. A special place is occupied by the Franco-German axis and German-Polish relations. The main task is to increase the economic competitiveness of the EU space in the context of Brexit and to strengthen its military and political security. Outside the European Union, Western Balkan, Russian, Ukrainian and Turkish directions are priority. The article analyzes the peculiarities of the European component of the foreign policy of new government and its influence on the future of Greater Europe. Particular attention is paid to the prospects of German-Russian relations.

AB The U.S. state environmental policy (both domestic and international) is of primary concern not only because this country has been a major political player for decades, but also because it is the top economy in the world significantly affecting the global environment. The article examines specifics of the American state environmental policy since 1980s (when the Republican candidate Ronald Reagan won presidential elections) up to the present day. The reasons for inconsistency of this policy, its practical effect, as well as the Green Movement's role in this process are investigated. Tendencies and prospects of the U.S. environmental policy, its impact on international nature protection activities are discussed. As is seen from a historical evaluation, for the last decades, the nature of this policy has been largely depending on an acting President's party identification. The Republican Government conducting an economic-based and profit-driven policy marks a "losing streak" for environment preservation, while the Democratic Government's environmentally friendly political line signifies a "streak of luck". The prevalent situation creates a danger of regress in the American environmental policy at the state (and thus international) level, makes for partial loss of previous achievements. Hence, the result still broadly depends on the commitment of a civil society, especially the "Greens", their success in influencing the environmental legislation and government action. Given that the American Conservationists' political standing comprises almost one and a half century by now, there is a hope that the "Greens" in the United States will be able to withstand new political and economic challenges so forth.

AB In Ancient Greece, the following types of gestures were in use (simplifying an unjustly complicated fivefold classification proposed by D. Lateiner and reducing it into three points): 1) conscious and ritualized gestures; 2) conscious but not ritualized gestures, of individual character; 3) unconscious gestures. In connection with the "rhetoric of gesture", this article deals mainly with gestures of the second category. After citing various examples from political and legal history of Archaic and Classical Athens, the author aims to demonstrate that in the framework of culture of conscious non-ritualized gestures, more restrained gestures were correlated (at least in the sources' perception) with a political position, which was also considered more moderate, and non-restrained gestures - with a radical position.

TI "CARE OF THE SELF" AS A WAY OF ACHIEVING WHOLENESS

DE man; wholeness of existence; self-care; teacher; ignorance
AB This article considers the issue of a possible actualization of the "care of the self" practice in the conditions of the fragmentarity of modern man's existence. The fragmentary nature is presently becoming one of the most important existential issues for man. This issue can be resolved neither through a forced integration of oneself into the framework of a certain system of beliefs nor through a conscious refusal of one's wholeness. In this situation it is justified to appeal to the classical antiquity regarding it as a special way of being and thinking. This method represents a one-of-a-kind combination of human individuality and natural involvement in the world (cosmos). The person who deserves a substantial credit for the actualization of this practice is Michel Foucault. This involves primarily focusing one's attention on the practice of being that was profoundly developed in the classical antiquity. This practice is juxtaposed with the position that has been dominant in the European culture since Descartes and can be described as 'theoretical'. Speaking of the most important conditions for the practice of 'care of the self' that are significant in the situation of the modern fragmentarity of existence, one can name ignorance and obligatory involvement of a teacher (mentor). Here ignorance is understood as a conscious refusal of defining a certain 'essence' or 'nature' of man. In this case the function of the teacher means encouraging to the radical questioning of oneself in the learner rather than transferring knowledge. This challenging of oneself, in its turn, happens to be a paradoxical way to re-create the holistic comprehension of the world in man. The wholeness is supported not by the system of the knowledge of the world but by the genuineness of the being that man experiences though the questioning of oneself. The need for such a practice requires a re-consideration of the modern education concept, including higher professional education. The most important element of education must be teaching a person to develop the ability to practice the holistic comprehension of oneself and the world. The leading role in the development of this ability must be played by philosophy in the sense of a spiritual and intellectual practice in which communication with the teacher is an essential component.

DE absenteeism; electoral process; political absenteeism
AB The authors analyse the causes, manifestations and possible ways of overcoming and reducing the scale of absenteeism as a phenomenon in the context of modern socio-political processes and transformations. The dominant characteristic of current elections is the widespread repudiation of the electoral system, political campaigns, parties and candidates. The authors reveal the essence of absenteeism, illustrate the forms of its manifestation, identify the reasons for political absenteeism as a personal position of a citizen, a political phenomenon and an integral part of the electoral and political processes. They also give a detailed typology of factors of absenteeism. The nature of absenteeism is revealed in the article in a multifaceted way: as an individual's political position (the aspect of individual choice), as a social phenomenon (an indicator of the level of involvement in politics of population groups) and as an inevitable element of the electoral process (reasons preventing the expression of the will of citizens). There is a methodology for analysing the indices and the voter confidence factor for candidates and political parties. The effects and consequences of the expansion of models of consumer and mass societies in hybrid and transitional regimes are considered. It is argued that in modern conditions it is necessary to link the solution of the problem of absenteeism with a broader cultural and identity problem, with a more complete description of the changes in the nature and status of various electoral groups. It is noted that it is necessary to link all kinds of decisions with a qualitatively new understanding of democracy (electronic, network, etc.). It is also promising to link the solution of the problem of absenteeism with the idea of a multi-level identity (the Swiss philosopher Denis de Rougemont) - local, regional, national, global-confessional -which, in the authors' opinion, is able to effectively solve the problem of political participation in multi-component societies, giving democracy (including in its electoral form) a new stimulus to development. To solve the problem of absenteeism, a new model of the political market is obviously proposed, its demonopolised model assuming that it is not dominated by the "seller" (the community of professional politicians) but by the "buyer" of such services - voters and all citizens acting on the basis of a developed feedback from the institutions of power and government. The article is a theoretical and methodological one.

DE communication; micro-social identity; humanitarian knowledge; soft
   skills; personal competences
AB There are some trends in modern Russian higher education which have an effect on the student's identity. They include: the shift of the educational paradigm and the transition from profession-oriented education to the formation of competencies; difficulties with the self-determination of graduates; change of "professor-student" relations under the influence of information technology for learning and teaching and reduction of the humanitarian component in education. This article aims to substantiate the importance of humanitarian knowledge in the construction of the modern student's identity. The authors' understanding of identity is based on the idea of communication and the principle of "Matryoshka". This means that identity is formed and manifested in communication and has the structure of a nest-doll (from the personal to civilization). The authors refer the student's identity to the micro-social level, which is formed on the grounds of belonging. It provides the first level of social identification and means existence of common identification parameters, i.e. qualities that its members have a priori. For the student, such qualities are the readiness to increase their intellectual capital, the ability to adapt quickly to new social and professional conditions, the focus on self-development and self-improvement, the ability to build relationships based on respect, openness and tolerance. All these abilities are related to general cultural and personal competencies or the so-called soft skills. The need for such skills arises not only in response to the external environment, e.g. socio-cultural situation, labor market challenges, but is an intestinal necessity of students themselves. These competencies are formed in the process of humanitarian knowledge deepening and social practice. Humanitarian knowledge in its essence introduces students to the values of culture and respect for cultural heritage and promotes the development of creative abilities and thinking, project activity skills, the ability to communicate in accordance with the principle of cultural awareness. In addition, humanitarian knowledge helps to overcome negative manifestations of student identity, such as excessive dependence on gadgets and the "Zuckerberg galaxy". In this case, humanitarian knowledge (philosophy, history, cultural studies) supports identity at higher levels of the "Matryoshka" identification: meso-and macro-social, i.e. ethno-cultural and civil.

DE care of the self; individualization; information accessibility;
   integrity of knowledge; mosaic picture of the world
AB The article discusses two key factors determining the specificity of learning in modern society: (1) the process of the unbridled individualization, and (2) the aggressive accessibility of information. If we take the ancient paideia, where man was "dissolved in the integrity" i.e. in the community and the cosmos as the starting point, we discover that the purpose of the socialization process which included upbringing and education was the creation of the citizen. In this situation, the person was directing towards wholeness through self-determining, and this makes the philosophical practice of "care of the self" the overcoming of individuality. In the recent conditions, "care of the self" turns to be the opposite of the ancient practice. People becoming mentally attached to external objects and following the changing fashion are "dissolved in individuality". Oral communication gives way to the visual one. At the extreme, the development of modern man turns into the self-assertion of the point. Yet, inside the aggressive information field, this egocentric orientation means the complete dependence on the external environment. Structured knowledge transforms into a flat information field that can be easily added without changing the overall picture. This picture is a mosaic randomly assembled from disparate pieces. Accordingly, the situation of the lack of understanding does not appear; yet this is the key situation for inquiry, because only the sense of misunderstanding, miscomprehension can lead to interest, to questions and, ultimately, to meaningful knowledge. If we turn to the ancient practice of learning by the example of Aristotle, we draw attention to the wholeness of knowledge, surprise as the beginning of knowledge, oral communication as a way of creating knowledge. Integrity is achieved by systematization of knowledge obtained by the establishment of genera and species relations. Surprise is necessary to fix the situation of misunderstanding. Oral communication determines the need to keep in mind a long chain of reasoning. This means a constant involvement of long-term memory, because only this type of memory allows constructing a multidimensional picture of the grasped reality. In addition, the dialogue, in which the training has been conducted, sets questions, hones the ability to build chains of reasoning and argument. It is all this that does not allow the modern student to ask questions.

   decorative art; arts and crafts; hieroglyphics; Buddhism
AB Cities played a significant role in the political and cultural life of the state of Bohai (698-926 AD) and constituted a distinctive element of administrative management of its territories. They differed from one another in terms of both their level of development and the status attributed to them (e.g., among them there were centres of wider and smaller administrative territories). However, up until now the everyday life of the Bohai urbanites have not attracted much of research attention. Meanwhile, over the recent decades Bohai urban settlements have been systematically excavated in Russia and there has been an influx of new data on urban topography, street networks, dwellings, public places, palaces, temples, and other ritual buildings. The most prominent sources of new information are excavations of the Bohai fortified towns in Primorye and publications on the Bohai archaeology in neighboring countries. Our studies of urban culture are based on geophysical research, spatial analysis of excavated city sites, and archaeological context and artifacts. Relevant historical reconstructions became possible after the analysis of available manuscripts had been conducted. Bohai cities were fortified with intricate systems of walls, moats, and strengthened gates. Their layout indicates the presence of standardised planning as to inner and outer communications in the form of roads, streets, plazas, and postal stations. They exemplify a regulated sort of city structure (e.g., in terms of the positioning of cult and administrative buildings and partitioning of urban space into industrial and dwelling zones). They acted as centers of crafts, trade, administration, culture, and religion. The urban culture of Bohai was forming gradually along with the development of the state itself. The process went faster in central regions, and these became a role model for new peripheral centers that emerged after the expansion of borders. We can discern two strata in the Bohai urban culture: the elite one was shaped under the heavy influence of Tang styles, fashions and trends and of Buddhist ideology; commoners, in turn, inherited their cultural traditions from the Mohe tribes that had founded the state of Bohai.

AB The university is a unique phenomenon of society. Being a humanitarian and cultural institution, it provides prerequisites for the development of non-humanitarian - natural-science, technocratic achievements of society. Being part of society, it provides its renewal in general through its product knowledge. The aim of the paper is to assess the mission of a National University from all-philosophical positions in the conditions of the dominant of information capitalism. The university was founded in the Middle Ages as an institution of humanitarian technologies for formatting the individual and society. As a specific institution of science and education it was formed as a corporation on the basis of social inquiry of new city layers. The classical university was founded in response to the economic, technological, social and cultural requirements of capital and industrialism. As a project of the Enlightenment it has innovative, educational, common cultural and world outlook functions. It is a subsystem of society and the state providing it with its world outlook and scientific knowledge. It promotes time progress and stability of society at the same time. The classical university had general cultural functions in society and was supported by the state. It was a self-organized system on the basis of rules of a scientific society. According to Humboldt's model the classical university provided development and broadcast of the universal system of knowledge integrated by philosophy. The most important task was the formation of public consciousness on the basis of a certain world outlook. The Soviet system kept the principles of this model; however, politicization, interference of the state and retaliatory bodies led to a deformation of the optimum model of the university. The modern national university is put in the conditions of state support and, at the same time, of commercial competition and of aims to get financial benefit. Effective mechanisms for solving this contradiction do not exist due to the inefficient model of informational capitalism in modern Russia. Insufficient funding and bureaucratization of higher education lead to a deadlock, at least, for social and humanitarian sciences. The external environment of university existence has changed, as well as its function. In many respects, it is caused by tendencies of informational capitalism. Professors and scholars are subject to super-exploitation in informational capitalism. The mission of the modern university is not sufficiently implemented, and its structure and functions are insufficiently adapted to the conditions of informational civilization. It is supposed that the main functions of the classical university have to be preserved, however, adapted to the conditions of the modern structure of knowledge, modern communications and requirements of the future.

DE theory of generative grammar; dynamic rule of generation; language
   competence; deep structure; surface structure; recursion; innatism
AB The article reveals the contribution of Noam Chomsky's theory of generative grammar to the linguistic and philosophical knowledge of the twentieth century. It is shown that the revolutionary nature of Chomsky's contribution lies in the new formulation of problems and in the use of the potential of the formalisation method in solving these problems. The author proves that the model of language proposed by Chomsky allowed transforming the basis of traditionalist structural linguistics. Conceptually significant in the article is a phenomenon Paul Ricoeur described as a "dynamic rule of generation": the dynamic concept of structuring activity comes to replace the "structured inventory" (Ricoeur's term). This allowed Ricoeur to call Chomsky's concept the concept of structure as an ordered dynamism. The stages of the formation of the generative grammar theory are indicated. It is also shown that this evolution reflects the specific features of this theory formed at the beginning of the 21st century. The postulate that the theory of morphological systems (forms of discourse) of Gustave Guillaume should be considered a variety of generative grammar is accepted in the article as the original one. Guillaume showed how a phrase is formed from words in the discourse activity; how the form of discourse, placing a word in the context of the phrase, completes the word; how the inclusion of a word in the context of the phrase creates an opportunity for words and discourses to be correlated with the world; finally, how signs "turn towards the universe" through the categories of discourse. Finally, the conceptualisation of the idea of innatism required such categories as language competence and use, deep structure, surface structure, recursion. Language has a rich constructive capacity which coexists with a limited number of verbal means. The author believes that the concepts "language competence" and "language use" are introduced to substantiate this thesis. The notions of "deep structure" and "surface structure" were introduced to denote syntactic links of the internal phase. Deep structure includes a system of elementary sentences. The grammatical structure of sentences is a product of transformation, based on the rules of deep grammar. It is an innate mechanism. It constitutes the knowledge of the language and the mechanisms of mastering the language. The ability of recursion (the ability to create nested sentences and constructs) is specific to the human language. Generativists explain the ability of a person to create and interpret an infinite number of grammatically correct utterances using a limited set of utterances previously found by the presence of recursive mechanisms: an utterance is created by applying a finite number of innate rules to the already known expressions. Generative grammar gives a formal description of these rules, and this allows us to consider it as a form of formal linguistics.

DE minority; world-politics; political subject; pre.ariat; rent-seeking
AB Capitalism has evolved from a liberal utopia to consumer technology, in which commodification reaches its limits penetrating into all spheres of social life. Historical intensification and expansion of autonomous markets helped to resolve structural contradictions of modern society at the expense of economic growth, technological progress and modern cultural technologies of disciplinary control. Under late capitalism, all these sources are close to exhaustion. The cultural and political order of late capitalism leads to a situation when the schizophrenic subject begins to predominate as a mass agent of political action. This agent loses its ability to effectively organise its collective (class) interests in the space of history, which becomes completely overshadowed by the space of culture that simulates history. The activity of schizophrenic subjects within the consumption culture codes, which they do not control, belongs to the symbolical order that does not lead to a change in the real political order. The weakening of the political subjectness of the new social groups is expressed in the fact that the local and private logic of the just redistribution, repair or treatment of the sociocultural trauma of a late capitalist society starts to dominate in the public political field, while none of these subjects can offer any essential utopian alternative to this type of society. The fatalistic political tolerance for the project of the Late Modernity as the eternal present is directly determined by the absence of a) the horizon of utopias, b) the collective sense of historical perspective, and c) class identity of precariat minorities as successors of disintegrated market economic classes. Strengthening non-market social groups in the situation of a downward social trajectory are increasingly falling back on local rent-seeking strategies that do not resolve, but only temporarily compensate the growing structural political conflicts in late modern society. It is argued that the return of the real political subjectness of the majority can be connected with the resurrection of history, utopias and the transformation of separate precarious groups into a new political class. These goals imply the legitimisation of a new political order in which the market ceases to be a key factor of stratification.

DE contemporary sociology; social inequality; access; Age of Access; Rifkin
AB The article aims to analyse the conception of social inequality in Jeremy Rifkin's theory of the "Age of Access". Rifkin is an American sociologist and economist widely known as a scientist dealing with the problems of ecology, energy, end-of-labour research. In the 1980s, researchers began to use the concept "access". At the turn of the century, this notion was spreading and symbolised, firstly, the expansion of types of social inequality under the influence of the development of information and communication technologies; secondly, the refusal to predominantly study the social structure as opposed to a complex system of inequality; thirdly, the rejection of the notion "society" in the classical sociological interpretation ("container" theory of society) and the transition to the study of society as a set of social connections, nodes, channels and flows (network methodology). Based on the notion "access", Rifkin developed the theory of the Age of Access. The Age of Access is a new way of conceptualising the concept "society". The key elements of the Age of Access are a shift from market to network relations; a shift from ownership of property as the main criterion of social inequality to access; marginalisation of tangible property and its replacement by the dominance of intellectual property. Social inequality in the Age of Access is a difference in access to the newest information and communication technologies, cultural experience and mobility. Rifkin defines the economic system of the Age of Access as "cultural capitalism". The commercialisation of culture leads to the transformation of everything into a commodity, and life is a paid-for experience. The heuristic of Rifkin's concept of social inequality consists in pointing out new forms of social inequality, as well as in fixing a complex system of relations between those "included" and "not included" in the Age of Access. The limitation of the concept is connected with the reduction of social inequality to its contemporary forms, although it should rather be about the intersection of traditional and new types of inequality. Concepts of social inequality based on the notion "access" (for example, Jan van Dijk's conception) can become the basis for studying social inequality in contemporary Russia, since they can explain the main trajectories of the development of social inequality relations.

AB The aim of the study was to identify the peculiarities in the contemporary development of public control institutions in the regions of the Siberian Federal District, including public councils under government bodies, as well as non-governmental organisations. The study was based on the following types of sources: statistical data of official authorities, official websites of regional and municipal authorities of Novosibirsk and Kemerovo regions, the Public Chamber of Kemerovo Region, the Public Chamber of Novosibirsk Region, non-profit organisations (Kemerovo regional public organisation Resource Centre for Support of Public Initiatives and the Siberian Politics foundation), works of Russian researchers dealing with the problems of civil society and social control. The paper considers the concept of public control. While there are a number of related concepts such as "social control", "people's control", "democratic control", "civil control" used in scientific research, the authors hold that the concept "public control" most fully reflects the ongoing social processes, and it should be viewed as an emerging social mechanism aimed at exercising control by the civil society over the federal and, to a greater extent, regional and municipal authorities by including representatives of public, non-profit organisations and expert community in the institutions of public control, as well as in the activities of regional non-profit organisations. The paper analyses the normative legal acts that provided for the formation of regional public councils under the bodies of legislative and executive power. Today, the Public Chambers of Novosibirsk and Kemerovo regions are regional discussion platforms for the development of further mechanisms for civil society development with the participation of public councils, the Public Chambers are engaged in improving the mechanisms for selecting personnel and monitoring their activities. At the same time, certain problems remain, including almost complete oversight on the part of the authorities, lack of real tools for influencing the authorities, and others. Certain significance in the issue of exercising public control over the authorities should be given to non-profit regional expert organisations. The activities of non-profit organisations can strengthen monitoring mechanisms in assessing the work of government bodies. In addition, in order to transform public councils and non-profit organisations into an effective institution of civil society and public control, further work is needed to improve the regulatory and legal framework, change the principles for the formation of the composition of public councils; besides, a better understanding of the significance of qualitative changes in managerial decision-making with direct participation of expert community at the regional level is required.

DE metaphysics; realism; empiricism; skepticism; world-without-man
AB The article discusses the problem of justification of metaphysics. The following characteristics of metaphysical thinking are distinguished: (1) it must be a speculative-theoretical conceptualisation, otherwise it would not differ in any way from formal logic and mathematics; (2) it is a holistic view of the world and can not do without a claim to systemic thinking. Kant set the task for metaphysics and metaphysicians to justify their claims. The contemporary answer to Kant's challenge acquires particular urgency. The metaphysical justification of science, destroyed by Kantian criticism, is now replaced by attempts of a scientific justification of metaphysics, and it comes to the metaphysical position of scientific realism. Discussions about the revival of metaphysics and its scientific justification are conducted both in analytic and continental philosophical traditions. An example of the justification of metaphysics through natural science is the argumentative strategy that appeals to the empirical discovery of the world-without-man. Quentin Meillassoux undertakes a thorough elaboration of this argument and takes it as the starting point of his reasoning in defence of speculative realism. This empirical argument indicates that a philosopher who adopts a critical position is a product of world history, or a part of the world, but not its transcendental constructor. However, a meaningful interpretation of the dating of arche-fossil and arche-observable objects and processes is possible only under certain axiomatic assumptions that are somehow taken for granted. These axiomatic assumptions form materialist and idealist ontologies, each of which saves the phenomenon of the world-without-man and thus is capable of supporting the assertion about the possibility of metaphysics. These two kinds of ontology can be contrasted with a skeptical point of view that speaks about their equality and thus denies metaphysics. But we can also ask the question of the ontological foundations of the skeptical position itself. We can distinguish ontological presuppositions and their subsequent conclusions - a metaphysical conclusion about the knowability of the world or an anti-metaphysical conclusion about the unknowability of the world. The conclusion about the unknowability of the world always rests on this or that ontology; otherwise it would be an empty nihilism of no philosophical significance whatever. What is important is that the skeptical position itself is a conclusion from the scientific ontology, which, from the point of view of the skeptic, is needed to 'save the phenomena'. Science, says a modern skeptic, tells us about reality, which is the result of adapting our theoretical constructions to empirical discoveries. The only reality that we have the right to have is a scientific reality. We can distinguish this reality from "unscientific reality" only within the framework of ontological interpretations of experience, interpreting experience either a 'scientific or 'unscientific' way. The anti-metaphysical conclusion of skepticism itself is an interpretation of scientific ontology. Thus, science can provide a justification for both metaphysics and anti-metaphysical, skeptical, conclusions. The justification of metaphysics is first and foremost a philosophical question. And the answer to it depends not only and not so much on science itself, but on the philosophical position chosen in relation to science.

TI THE PENITENTIARY SYSTEM MODERNIZATION CONCEPT AS A DOCTRINAL POLITICAL
   AND LEGAL ACT
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE penal policy; penitentiary system; doctrinal legal acts
AB In recent years official acts of the atypical legal nature (foundations, concepts, strategies, programs, doctrines etc.) have increasingly become the subject of discussions for lawyers. With the advent of Federal Law No. 172-FZ of June 28, 2014 the category "documents of strategic planning" was brought both into legal science and practice. However, the status of such acts and the bodies which are authorized to pass them, requirements to their content and structure as well as their legal value were not accurately defined. Unresolved questions of the general theory of law result in a number of problems in the concrete fields of political and legal practice, and the activity of the penitentiary system of the Federal Penitentiary Service of the Russian Federation is not an exception. In 2020 the operation of the Concept of the Development of the Penitentiary System in the Russian Federation adopted by the Government of Russia in 2010 will be terminated. Practical work on the preparation of materials for a new Concept has already been started within the framework of the Federal Service. However, from a scientific perspective there is no due clarity about the subject of the new doctrinal political and legal act, about its main objectives, the decision-making level, structure, content and the mechanism of implementation. The author resolves the above mentioned issues and invites to an extensive public discussion on the subject which since Gulag has been very significant and even painful for our society. Using a wide range of sources of both general and special character (specifically in their historical aspect) and penal practice, he expresses and argues a number of judgments pertaining to the new doctrinal political and legal document in the sphere of criminal penalties enforcement in perspective till 2030. According to the author, the future document should be called "The Concept of Modernization of the Penitentiary System" and include only the most important, basic regulations about the purposes, tasks and directions of reforming the system of institutions and bodies involved in the enforcement of penalties. This does not exclude but involves the adoption of a "road map" for the implementation of the Concept. There is no need to mix the questions of penal (and much less - criminal) policy with the questions of the penitentiary system. The latter is the implementation tool for penal policy and not vice versa. Therefore, the aspiration to include separate sections about criminal and penal policy into the Concept of Modernization of the Penitentiary System proves to be unfair. A new Federal Law on the penitentiary system (the current law has become outdated since 1993) should lie at the heart of its modernization. Particular attention should be given to the principles of the new Concept. They do not coincide with the principles of penal legislation established in the law, though they should not contradict them.

DE dating site adverts; comparative analysis; gender identity; female

AB The article deals with the verbal construction of the gender identity of the female language personality on the material of Polish and Russian dating site adverts. In the Slavic world the gender identity is based on Christian values that shape the patriarchal consciousness. In the Soviet period of the history of the Eastern Slavic countries the ideology of female social emancipation emerged and manifested in the image of a working mother. This type of the gender identity can be defined as androgynous. The current stage is characterised by fundamental changes in the socio-political and economic structure of the Eastern European countries. It coincides with the emergence of new, equal relations between the genders in all developed countries in the last third of the twentieth century. An emerging new type of the gender identity demonstrates the breakdown of traditional values typical to the Slavic mentality. Dynamic processes are reflected in modern speech practices. A comparative analysis of Polish and Russian dating site adverts shows that the real femininity of modern women is of a variable nature. However, the research shows the rooted patriarchal foundations of the Slavic culture as well as the consolidation of the androgynous gender identity, similar for the Russian and Polish mentality, which remain different in the current gender attitudes. New value preferences of Russian women demonstrate the desire to level the female principle and acquire the leadership and psychological features of the masculine type. The gender behaviour of Polish women reveals a tendency to build an equal relationship with a man while emphasizing their femininity which they consider to be a virtue but not a flaw. Partnership for Polish women is implemented in gender complementarity.

AB The author analyzes a wide range of issues related to the problems of the state language that are relevant for post-Soviet societies and states, the Russian language and specific features of the phenomenon of Russian-speaking. The consequences of the informal alliance of a part of the former party nomenclature with supporters of forced "Belarusization" in the first period of independent Belarus history are assessed. The significance of the 1995 referendum for the model of a civil-political nation in Belarus is revealed. The interpretation of changes in the number of Russians in the censuses in 1999 and 2009 is provided. The authors identifies the trends in the Russian-speaking areas of Belarus. It is shown that Belarus occupies a special place in the post-Soviet space after the introduction of state bilingualism. To verify the accusations of the Belarusian leadership in pursuing the policy of "creeping Belarusianization," the trends of Belarusian and Russian-language education over the past 12 years have been explored. The authors point out that in the Belarusian society there is a broad consensus on the positive role played by the Russian language.

A new social group with Romanian national identity has emerged among the population and has formed the core of the unionist movement promoting the unification of Moldova and Romania. The article deals with different social and political forms of pro-Romanian (including pan-Romanian) views. The core elements of Romania's long-term strategy towards Moldova, based on the concept of the "two Romanian states", have been explored. The facts proving the growing social and political influence of unionism have been analyzed, as well as the factors that counter the spread of unionist ideas.

DT Article
DE Russia-NATO relations; enlargement policy; military confrontation;
   crisis of European security; Cold War; negotiations on conventional
   forces in Europe; confidence building measures
AB The end of the Cold War stimulated decisive positive changes in Russia-NATO relations. American military presence in Europe was reduced by 85% which was one of the signs of growing trust between Russia and the West. Moscow and Brussels adopted a number of documents (NATO-Russia Founding Act of 1997 among them) proclaiming mutual intention to develop a "stable and long-term partnership". Unfortunately, a number of drawbacks in the Western strategy towards Russia (most notably NATO's enlargement policy) almost derailed prospects to realize the above intention. Negative developments of the military political situation in Europe and in the world resulting from the Ukrainian crisis drastically aggravated the interaction between Russia and Western countries. As a result, Russia-NATO relations were thrown back on the brink of the Cold War and degraded from the level of developing cooperation with the goal of establishing partnership-like cooperation to a deep mistrust. For the first time since the Cold War, the militaries of the parties almost came in close contact creating the risk of military conflict. In this situation, reducing the level of mutual confrontation becomes an urgent task. To achieve this a number of measures may be undertaken: the mechanism of direct bilateral dialogue (primarily within the NATO-Russia Council) should be restarted, steps should be taken to prevent incidents on and over the high seas, certain key provisions of the Founding Act should be clarified and specified, the level and numbers of military maneuvers should be lowered significantly, zones of the reduced levels of armaments should be established, the process of negotiations on arms control and confidence building measures in Europe should be resumed. In fact, a number of such measures may be proposed. But it is important to take into consideration that the discussion on "modernization" of the 2011 Vienna Document on confidence-and security-building measures proposed by the West may be effectively started only in line with the development of a dialogue on security and arms control and achieving here sizable results. The parts should reduce drastically declaratory accusations addressing each other and try to refrain from activity that would be negatively perceived by the other side.

TI Hierarchical partitions of social networks between rivaling leaders
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID OPINION FORMATION; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; COMPLEX NETWORKS
AB A model algorithm is proposed to imitate a series of of consecutive conflicts between leaders in social groups. The leaders are represented by local hubs, i.e., nodes with highest node degrees. We simulate subsequent hierarchical partitions of a complex connected network which represents a social structure. The partitions are supposed to appear as actions of members of two conflicted groups surrounding two strongest leaders. According to the model, links at the shortest path between the rival leaders are successively removed. When the group is split into two disjoint parts then each part is further divided as the initial network. The algorithm is stopped, if in all parts a distance from a local leader to any node in his group is shorter than three links. The numerically calculated size distribution of resulting fragments of scale-free Barabasi-Albert networks reveals one largest fragment which contains the original leader (hub of the network) and a number of small fragments with opponents that are described by two Weibull distributions. A mean field calculation of the size of the largest fragment is in a good agreement with numerical results. The model assumptions are validated by an application of the algorithm to the data on political blogs in U.S. (L. Adamic and N. Glance, Proc. WWW-2005). The obtained fragments are clearly polarized; either they belong to Democrats, or to Republicans. This result confirms that during conflicts, hubs are centers of polarization.

These challenges are associated with the recent global economic crisis, characterized by deep changes in various spheres of life of the EU member states, including the political domain. The migration crisis has played its own important role, which has had a profound negative impact on the European countries leading to more pronounced xenophobia and nationalism. The representatives of populist ideological and political movements have taken advantage of it. Nevertheless, in the majority of the EU countries the political systems have demonstrated resilience towards populism.

DE analytical philosophy; institutional economics; philosophy of
   consciousness; theory of speech acts; principles of institutionalism
AB The article examines the influence of analytical philosophy on the institutional direction of economic theory. Two points are the most relevant and discussed: it is the impact of the analytic philosophy of consciousness and the theory of speech acts on the institutional theory. The institutional environment is associated with the functioning of human consciousness by several reasons:
   - There is an infinite variety and variability of human activity, the forms of which create a wide range of models of social behavior and determine economic changes.
   - Human consciousness does not simplify the models of reality but reproduces them in more detail. The development of the language and the system of symbols leads to progression in the structuring of the environment that is created more complicated forms of social organization.
   - Institutional traits do not have attributes that are of natural origin. A man does not have a genetic inclination to create institutional memes. Objects of the world cannot be objects of institutional reality because of their physical structure. Intentionality of a man determines the institutions.
   - Institutional development arising from the growth of knowledge and technology determines the process of complicating social structures, which increases uncertainty about the social role of the person.
   The influence of language on the formation of institutional reality is described in the theory of speech acts. The emergence of institutional facts is a process in which intentionality acquires a collective form of ascription of functions that are not physically peculiar to objects. Language is the necessary basis for the creation of collective intentionality. The very existence of institutions, their functions and deontology is represented with the help of language facilities. The principle of hierarchy of institutional reality points to the existence of institutional conditions for the effectiveness of institutions of a different order. The theory of speech acts claims the absence of an infinite regression in this hierarchy. Institutions will form other institutions throughout the life of humankind but each of these institutions is impossible without the availability of linguistic facilities that underlie the institutional reality.

Three methodological problems are singled out in the article: the problem of the correlation between everyday life and institutional order, the problem of the correlation of the rational and the non-rational in people's lives, the problem of mechanisms for changing reality. The limitations of the phenomenological interpretation of everyday life were analysed, and the methodological possibilities of practice theories are shown. The methodological potential of everyday life studies of the following theories was analyzed: P. Bourdieu's theory of habitus, N.

SO SOCIAL EVOLUTION & HISTORY
LA English
DT Article
AB In the first years of independence, United National Independence Party (UNIP) and President of Zambia Kenneth Kaunda, realizing that Zambia as a young multi-ethnic state can develop only assuming normal relations between its 73 ethnic groups, proclaimed the slogan 'One Zambia is One People' as the basic principle of nation-building. The formation of a young nation should also be facilitated by the introduction of the principle of regional and ethnic balancing - quotas for various ethnic groups for representation in government bodies. Under the conditions of political pluralism since 1991, power in Zambia was transferred peacefully, including after the victory of the opposition in the elections in 2011. Zambia is often called a successful example of achieving ethno-political consolidation in a multi-ethnic African state, which can be regarded as a certain success in the formation of a national state. The new president Edgar Lungu re-elected in September 2016 declares that the policy of his government and of the PF party will be firmly based on the inviolability of the principle 'One Zambia - One Nation'.

DE trust to social sciences; students of the universities; interest in

AB The article deals with the problem of trust to social sciences in Russia. The paper consists of three parts. In the first one, the authors discuss the theoretical aspects of the sociological study of trust to the social sciences. The authors note the declining of trust to social knowledge in the last decades both in Russia, and in the whole world. Based on the P. Sztompka theory of trust to science, we analyze the universal reasons and specific Russian factors of weakening of trust to social knowledge and describe its consequences. Special attention is paid to the university students as a target group of social knowledge consumers and as the main actor of new generation of social scientists reproduction. In the second part, the methodology of empirical research of trust to social sciences among university students is described. The aim of the empirical research is to investigate the level of trust among the students through their perception of social science and their attitude to the science as a possible future profession. We present the system of predictors for the empirical research of the trust level. In the third part, the data of poll of 400 students of Moscow and regional universities studying the social disciplines are interpreted. The following important issues concerning students' attitude to this subject are considered: students' perception of social sciences; comparison of level of trust to social knowledge created by the Russian and western scientists; students' interest to social sciences; factors of increase of trust to social sciences. The findings of the study show contradiction of the "image" of social sciences created in consciousness of students. On the one hand, they have the belief in "the science force". On the other hand, students reveal vulnerability of social science in a situation of dynamically changing realities that is seen in the fast obsolescence of social knowledge. Perception of the development of social knowledge in Russia is also ambiguous. According to the survey data, students don't differentiate the western and Russian social science regarding the trust to the science. More than 60% of the interviewed students consider that they can trust to majority of the scientific results made by both the Russian, and western social scientists. Though we have rather high level of trust to scientific knowledge, the students' interest in science is low. The results of empirical estimation of factors of trust increase confirm that the closure of scientific findings and lack of institutional channels of distribution of social knowledge and results of researches to the general population lead to the decrease of public interest in social sciences. On the contrary, the "openness" of social sciences and the raising the social prestige of scientists are the significant conditions of engaging youth in science.

DE Republic of Dagestan; Nogai municipal district; power struggle;
   competitive selection; Nogais protests; ethno-political mobilization
AB In the spring - summer of 2017 in the Nogai District of the Republic of Dagestan protest actions of the local public were held against the interference of regional (Dagestani) authorities in matters of local self-government, i.e. the election of the head of the municipal district. Agents of the regional authorities, using the procedure of competitive selection of candidates for the post of head of the municipal formation, tried to influence the outcome of the election campaign. These events became the reason for the ethnopolitical mobilization of the Nogai from all over Russia. Nogais living in other parts of Russia, as well as the diaspora living in Kazakhstan, expressed their solidarity for their fellow Nogais after the events in Dagestan. The escalation of the conflict was also influenced by the ethnically homogeneous district, which allowed accumulating the mobilization potential of the ethnic identity of Nogais. The present paper is an attempt to clear up the logic of development of contemporary ethnopolitical processes in the North Caucasus basing on the event analysis of the struggle for power and protests in the Nogai District of Dagestan.

DE total factor productivity; social capital; political stability;

AB This article is devoted to the analysis of the impact of economic development on the survival of democratic regimes and success of the processes of democratization. The study is based on the hypothesis proposed by S.M. Lipset and further elaborated by A. Przeworski that the growth of social welfare leads to the broadening of a "compromise space" and convergence of different interest groups' preferences over the redistribution of resources, which in its turn mitigates conflict over the political course. Based on Lipset's and Przeworski's ideas, the authors build a mathematical model that illustrates how social capital (more precisely - its component responsible for building trust among strangers) and institutional quality allow for the stabilization of democratic regimes, through the increase of economic productivity and growth of welfare. According to the predictions of the model, total factor productivity (TFP), defined as the opportunity of individuals and/or firms to cooperate efficiently, increases the overall wealth of the society and fosters the consolidation of democracy by reducing social tensions and improving the mechanism of economic policy elaboration.
   On the basis of the mathematical model, the authors derive a hypothesis that higher levels of TFP increase chances of democratic survival. They test the hypothesis on the extensive empirical dataset using survival analysis method. The results show that TFP is a statistically significant and strong predictor of a probability of democratic failure. On average, ceteris paribus, the increase in TFP by 10 percentage points reduces the risk of democratization failure by 1.2-1.4 times. The obtained results are robust to different model specifications and control variables.

AB After the revolution, on 18 Fructidor of the year V the Directory introduced censorship, initiated repressions and established a bureau for control of public opinion. One of heads of this bureau, a Jacobean V.R. Barbet discussed the political system of Russia. Emergence of "Russophobia" is often connected with the consequences of Napoleonic wars and the birth of this phenomenon is usually dated by the first quarter of the 19th century. On the basis of documents of National Archive of France, it has been shown that the idea of "the Russian danger" to the European balance of forces was developed in 1797-1798 by Jacobeans who actually borrowed this idea from monarchists. The efforts of the Directory did not produce a "phobia" in the society, which would be characteristic of the middle of the 19th century, though it succeeded in increasing skepticism concerning degree of a civilization of Russia.

AB The archaeological site of Dzhankent, in addition to its geographical position and the wealth of finds from there, occupies a special place for several other reasons, too. It was the first site in Central Asia to be excavated (1740-1740 and photographed (1858), and it has recently become one of the national symbols of independent Kazakhstan (since 1991). Over the period of more than 270 years during which it has been studied, Dzhankent has been approached by generations of explorers, excavators and researchers from different theoretical positions and with different aims which have corresponded more or less to political or geopolitical programmes. The aim of this contribution is, on the one hand, to show how the various actors who worked at this site related to one another and to the various types of power (local, Tsarist, Soviet), and on the other hand, to analyze the changes in the theoretical approaches of these actors. At the same time, it is important to trace the transformation of Dzhankent, in its pre-colonial, colonial and post-colonial contexts, into a memorial supposedly linked to imperial or national identities which, in turn, had been forged around a constructed past.

DE Higher education institutions; legal model for the formation of a staff
   reserve; professional qualification improvement; qualification
   examination; management
AB The strategy for the development of Russian higher education institutions has a direct connection with the personality of the head of the educational organization and its management team. The modern higher education organization functioning in an open market environment is closely integrated into all processes of both local and global economy, which requires the leader of specific "market" competencies that were previously excluded in the Soviet period. At present, the rector has much more managerial functions, at the same time the requirements to the speed of managerial decisions are multiplying, and the price of managerial errors, including those caused by economic factors, is increasing. All this leads to the fact that the modern sociological portrait of the rector includes not only the characteristics of his professional competence, but also his business and organizational abilities, political culture, moral qualities and efficiency.
   In this regard, the creation of a legal model and mechanisms for the formation of the staff reserve of rectors, as well as the improvement of their certification procedure is relevant. In order to determine the main directions for the development of the current system of training the heads of higher education institutions, the weak and strong aspects of the personnel policy of past periods were determined by retrospective analysis, and the findings were used to develop the procedure for attestation and selection of candidates for the staff reserve. The carried-out researches by a hermeneutic method, a method of legal forecasting and normative legal modeling have allowed to prepare methodical, normative and legal basis of formation mechanisms of a personnel reserve of heads for the federal educational organizations. The functional analysis of the work activities of the higher education organization heads made it possible to form a sociological portrait of the rector.
   As a result of the conducted studies, a legal model for the formation of a staff reserve of managers for Russian higher education institutions, a procedure for attestation and assessment of their professional qualification improvement was developed. The necessity of creating a unified information base of candidates for inclusion in the staff reserve of rectors is substantiated. A proposal for a state information system to support and conduct certification of heads of the federal educational organizations of higher education, including a qualification examination, was formed. The use of information platforms will ensure the prompt and effective interaction of all participants in the relevant process on the basis of the use of modern information technologies.

   Euroscepticism; xenophobia; France's National Front; Dutch Party for
   Freedom; Alternative for Germany; Sweden Democrats
AB The article details the phenomenon of the modern right-wing radicalism in Western Europe. Special attention is paid to the analysis of far-right politics in different West European countries, such as France, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Germany, Denmark, Finland, Sweden and Norway. The author identifies the causes and factors which facilitated the transformation of several marginal extreme right movements and parties into a real threat to the European political mainstream. At the same time, the article reveals the latest trends amid the Europe elections 2016-17: right-wing parties have limits on the political scene. Defeat of Marine Le Pen in France, Geert Wilders in the Netherlands and Timo Soini in Finland for some time will serve as a good reminder across Europe that populism and popularity, democratization of the party image and shifting to the political centre, charismatic leader and even joining the ruling class do not necessarily lead to the real power. Establishment activation in terms of anti-immigration and Euroskeptic rhetoric as well as party identification lability of modern European voters are clearly impairing far-right parties ratings and items. It's finally destroying their strategic perspective. The 2017 election failure of the anti-EU UKIP Party in England demonstrated the complete inability of a right-wing single-issue party. Just Sweden Democrats and Alternative for Germany are still very successful. However, the voices of far-right parties will hardly be heard in the German Bundestag and in the Sweden Riksdag due to multiplicity of the ruling parliamentary coalitions in these two West European countries.

DE Kalmykia; Kalmyk Autonomous Region (Oblast); Kalmyks; peasantry; cattle

   (NEP); political mood; everyday life
AB The article examines the everyday life of the Kalmyk peasantry in close connection with its political mood in the 1920s. It highlights economic, social and political factors which affected their life and political mood. These factors comprise anti-Bolshevik insurgency, organized criminal activity, the policies pursued by the Bolshevik party and the Soviet government to bring the Kalmyks to the settled way of life, the new economic and taxation policies. Social, economic and political changes transformed the relations among the peasants in their labour and everyday activities, in their lifestyle. The peasantry actively entered into new social relationships and the transformed rural way of life. Nevertheless, the changes initiated by the central and local authorities were not always supported by the rural population. Whereas the peasants approved of the measures performed by the Soviet government aimed at restoring and developing their economy, it was not a rare occasion when the social and economic work of the authorities and bureaucracy made the Kalmyks dissatisfied. This dissatisfaction triggered both hidden and open counteraction on the part of the peasants against the central and local authorities, the most common acts being failure to observe the laws and orders adopted by the state as well as tax evasion. Sometimes concealed opposition gave way to open military resistance. Generally, the Kalmyk peasants, limited by the needs of their own households and their families' routine in their locality, were indifferent to the political appeals of the Soviet power.

DT Article
DE Archival document; historical source; Siberia; exile; perlustration;
   ego-document
AB The article studies the Turukhansk region as a territory With distinct climatic conditions and, consequently, with distinctive state management institutions and does so in the context of modernization processes of late 19th early 20th centuiy. This pail of the Yenisei gubernia having become a region of mass exile after the First Russian Revolution of 1905-1907, its integration into a general system of management slowed down. Private letters of exiles are an important historical source, they reveal many aspects of the daily life of the persons under supervising in the inter-revolutionary period. The Turukhansk revolt' in the winter of 1908/09 revealed not only the ineffectiveness of exile as a penal measure, but also several major problems of the region: archaic and scanty management institutions, lack of transport communication with southern uezds of the gubemia, underpopulation, and also gubemia and metropolitan officials' ignorance of local affairs. The agencies of the Police Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs expanded the practice of perlustration as involvement in the revolutionary movement grew. Siberian exiles had their correspondence routinely inspected, and yet in most cases they were inexperienced enough not to encrypt their messages. Surviving perlustration materials offer an ambivalent picture of the 'Turukhansk revolt': there were both approval and condemnation of the participants' actions. The documents tell a tale of extreme cruelty of the punitive detachments even towards those who were not involved in the resistance. The subject of the Siberian exile of the early 20th century has research potential. There is virtually no scholarship on the exiles self-reflection on the 'common violence' of both anti-governmental groups and state punitive agencies. Diversification in political/party or social/class affiliation is not enough. The new materials have revealed a significant gap between several 'streams' of exiles: those banished to Siberia in midst of the First Russian Revolution differed from those exiled in 1910s. The article concludes that, having departed from the previous approach to studying the exile, ego-sources cease to he of lesser importance than other types of historical sources. Their subjectivity becomes an advantage for a high-quality text analysis.

DE social history of science; Vasily Nemchinov; Nikolay Fedorenko; economic
   and mathematical methods; optimal plan; "self-supporting planning"
AB The evolution of the Soviet economic thought is shown as a cultural and intellectual process. In this framework, the views of Academician Vasily Nemchinov on "self-supporting planning" and the theoretical justification of Academician Nikolay Fedorenko on the need for a unified system of optimal functioning of the economy (SOFE) are reviewed. The author demonstrates how the CPSU committees controlled and exerted administrative pressure on Fedorenko and leading scientists of the Central Economic Institute. The negative role of Gosplan and the Soviet ministries in the early 1970s in practical work to improve the centralized planning system, as well as opposition to the development and phased implementation of the system of optimal economic functioning, is shown. The content of the discussion on the problems of optimal planning and management of the 1960s - middle 1970s is analyzed. The author reveals not only sharp objections, but also contradictions that arose due to the fact that some participants in the discussion did not take into account the urgent need for a significant transformation of the economic mechanism or remained captive to the military communist perceptions of planning. The lessons of the discussion around economic and mathematical researchers indicate the isolation of many Soviet political and economic approaches from real economic processes. The author concludes that the authoritarian political system formed a corresponding administrative, lined system and science. As a result, the intellectual resistance of science to external influences weakened, the practice of centralized planning stagnated, and sociocultural split and conformism intensified among the scientific community.

AB The article analyzes the socio-economic, political, institutional and sociocultural factors that are the most significant, based on the results of in-depth interviews with experts from Moldova and Romania, the resultant of which was the actual registration of these territories as "territories of underdevelopment" and which will play a decisive role in the future preservation of either change of this status. The historical features of nation-building and identity politics in Romania and Moldova and their actual contexts, patterns of identity and self-realization of citizens, the nature of public delimitation, the state of the communicative field of society and power, interaction with supranational entities are examined. According to the authors, the key factors contributing to the preservation of the territories of underdevelopment are the ever-widening gap between society and the authorities against the backdrop of systemic corruption of the latter, the lack of a consistent policy of building and consolidating the civil nation and in general, building and co-operating with the society an original political national project, and also ineffective use of the internal development potential, coupled with the preservation of a complex of unresolved socio-economic problems.

AB The article analyzes a corpus of sources that formed the basis of the most notable record of the Qing, Empire, the 'Truthful Record of the Qing Dynasty' (Qing shi-lu). The analysis is based on a careful study of Russian, Chinese and Mongolian scholarship. A historical treatise 'Truthful Record of the Mongols under the Qing Dynasty' based on the Qing shi-lu and written in the Old Mongolian script was published in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of the People's Republic of China in 2013. A team of researchers from the Institute of Mongolian, Buddhist and Tibetan Studies of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAN) has been working on its translation, source studies and historical analysis, as its materials supplement the available data on the purport and sources of the Qing shi-lu. Review of its sources allows a better assessment of the veracity of the historical data of the 'Truthful Record of the Qing Dyasty' and a deeper understanding of its rich historical material on the Manchu dynasty ruling China, as well as Inner Asia during the Qing period. The article reviews the sources of the Qing shi-lu as listed in the `Tnithful Record of the Mongols under the Qing Dynasty.' Information on the Man Wen Lao Dang ('The Old Archive of the Manchu Language') is amassed and analyzed. The Man Wen Lao Dang was one of the sources used in compiling of early chronicles of the deeds of the first Manchu rulers into the 'Truthful Record.' The official historiographical and record-keeping tradition Was then emerging in China under the Manchu dynasty. The authors assess the purport of the 'Truthful Record of the Qing Dynasty' throughout the spectrum of historical and political 'functions of the treatise. Analyzing of the sources of the 'Truthful Record of the Qing Dynasty,' including official documents untainted by compilers interpretation, and studying the import of the text in the political life allows to contend great value and veracity of the Qing shi-lu. The authors see new possibilities for studying international relations in the history of Inner Asia.

AB The article examines the history of the emergence and activities of the committee established by the Ministry of Finance on February 18, 1844 "to discuss the assumptions of Lieutenant Colonel Kazimirsky regarding improving the gold industry in Siberia". This committee drew the authors' attention for some reasons. Firstly, it is a rare example of an interdepartmental institution of the first half of the 19th century, created on the initiative of the chief of the III department and chief of the gendarmes A. Kh. Benkendorf. Secondly, the circumstances of the establishment of the committee show how the deraptment of political police could influence the activities of the ministries. And, thirdly, up to the present time the history of the activities of this committee has not specifically attracted the attention of researchers. The following research tasks were set: 1) to identify the reasons and circumstances of the establishment of the committee; 2) to characterize the composition of the committee; 3) to analyze the information about the issues considered by the committee and their implementation in practice. The main sources for the article were the materials stored in the central state archives of Russia. The article is based on the application of such methods of historical science as narrative, historical-genetic and comparative-historical analysis. The authors came to the following conclusions. The specificity of the committee's activities is bases on the fact that the initiative to create it came from the chief of the gendarmes, whereas the issues submitted for discussion were under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance. Chief of gendarmes A. Kh. Benkendorf insisted on including a gendarme headquarters officer in the committee, thus giving him the opportunity to influence the committee's activities. However, in the future, Benkendorf himself did not participate in determining the composition and order of the committee's work, and the finance minister evidently was not interested in carrying out the reforms initiated by another agency. Probably, this predetermined the modest results of the committee's work: a large list of innovations proposed by the gendarmerie agency was considered during one meeting, of which some partial measures were implemented, but they did not radically affect the development of the Siberian gold industry.

DE ethnic territorial autonomy; language preferential policy;

AB A language is one of the significant factors that determine the structural characteristics of ethnic territorial autonomies. At the same time it is the object of preferential language policy that conducted by both national and regional governments. The article focuses on the question about the interrelation between the strength of autonomy and the scope of language preferential policy institutionalization. Last one is manifested in the weight of linguistic territorial regime. As a result of correlation analysis (the sample includes 28 cases) and comparative-oriented case-study analysis of Wales and Scotland in UK, Basque Country in Spain and Vojvodina in Serbia the structural and contextual factors causing or violating links between the strength of autonomy and the scope of language preferential policy institutionalization were identified. The features of the community' ethnic structure and ethno-linguistic minority share are the structural factors. The size of minority share affects the strategy and resources of the political actors who able to manifest language requirements and to convert it into institutionalized language policy. These actors are political parties, ethnic councils and NGO. The historical background and political context of ethnic territorial autonomy formation and language preferential policy institutionalization constitute the second group of factors. The logic of interrelation of both groups of factors is explained.

DE Yakut language; terms construction; terminological lexis; term;

AB The features of term studies formation in the works of researchers of the Sakha language in the 1920-1940-ies are considered. It is reported that at this time, a lot of work was done to develop the theoretical foundations and principles of creating the terms of the Sakha language, as well as a large number of terms in various fields of knowledge, especially in the socio-political sphere. It is emphasized that terminology complexes have been developed in all subjects in the volume of high school. It is shown that these goals were achieved relatively quickly because of the Yakut intelligentsia leaders of terms construction, who recognized the great importance of this work, enthusiastically took up the work and led others. Among leaders there were now well-known figures of language and - wider - cultural construction: A. E. Kulakovskiy, S. A. Novgorodov, A. A. Ivanov, G. V. Baishev ( known by literary pseudonym Altan Saryn) and P. A. Oyunskiy. The article notes that each of these scientists went his own way, had his own priorities. Based on the results of the review, it is proved that the activity on the Yakut terminology system development was initially focused on two main ways of terminology fund formation: the use of internal language resources and borrowing of terms from other languages, in particular Russian. The article attempts to analyse dictionaries compiled by figures of linguistic construction of 1920-1940 from the point of view of the theory of modern thermography in order to optimize typical and composite parameters of terminological dictionaries.

AB In the studies of Russian regions' political history during the transition period from soviet to modern federal statehood conditions for a qualitatively new stage has been matured. An active transformative phase of their political dynamics has come to an end not only in its institutional dimension but also in a broad cultural-historical sense. The possibilities are opening to get to theoretically meaningful interpretation of real outcomes of a transition period. Such a study would inevitably assume an interdisciplinary character, using hand in hand methods and conceptions of history and political science. It would be feasible to conduct it in reference to the case of the single subject of the federation so that the operating by the categories of political theory would allow coming to generalizations bounded by given regional context. The present article deals with the causal variables, mechanisms, and phases of a post-soviet political transformation of Kabardin-Balkar Republic in the 1990s and 2000s. In the 1990s political process in the Republic developed autonomously, correlating with all Russia's transformative dynamics, but free from the direct control of federal-state powers. Interethnic frictions were the main "domestic" factor determining the course of political developments. Nevertheless, institutional results of systemic transformation embodied not the "soverignization", separatist aspirations or ethnopolitical cleavage, but a general move of Russia toward democratic federalism. The further political development made it evident that in the legacy of the 1990-s integrative impulse as such were more essential than its democratic and federalist form. So, the Republic entered the general turn of Russia's domestic politics toward the recentralization and strengthening of "power vertical" in the 2000s without any tension. Regional elites unequivocally upheld all the central state powers' initiatives in an institutional restructuring of Russian federalism. When possibilities were opened to return to a more immediate representation of the population in regional Parliament and to direct election of the Head of Republic they were not made use of. So, political regime in modern Kabardin-Balkaria has so much similarity with the Soviet "nomenklatura" system that transition period between them may be correctly interpreted rather in terms of "metamorphosis" than of "transformation".

AB The fuel crisis in besieged Leningrad was one central aspect of life in the besieged city. Motor transportation was inextricably linked with supply of fuel, and transportation was an important factor in the city's struggle for survival in the conditions of the Blockade. Despite the shortage of motor fuel, motor transportation in Leningrad throughout the Blockade did not completely stop its activities. In the merciless winter of 1941-1942 it remained the only type of city transportation that carried a near- unbearable burden: provision for vital activity of Leningrad and its defense. Leningraders' incredible courage and heroism allowed them not only to defend Leningrad, but also to support the work of road transportation inside the blockade ring. This was possible due to the introduction of gas-generating vehicles that operated on less scarce types of fuel: wood chips, coal, and even peat. The use of solid fuel in place of liquid fuel, despite its low cost and relatively easy availability, was not widespread in the pre-war period due to the complexity of operation and maintenance of gas-generating equipment. This article considers the importance and number of gas-generating vehicles in Leningrad's general transport system, including introduction, repair, and operation of gas-generating equipment during the siege. Data are from documents of the St. Petersburg Central State Archive, the St. Petersburg Central State Archive of Historical and Political Documents, and the St. Petersburg Central State Archive of Scientific and Technical Documentation.

AB The Vietnam War is the longest war of the United States, the strategic goal of which was the long-term division of Vietnam and the transformation of South Vietnam into a separate pro-American state as a part of the "free world", opposing the "communist camp". As a result, the United States had to retreat before the aspiration of the Vietnamese people for national independence and reunification. The turning point to the de-escalation of the American presence in Vietnam was the Tet Mau Than 1968 General Offensive and Uprising, according to the name of the lunar New Year.
   This article gives an analysis of the US strategy during the Vietnam War at various stages and shows the impact of the Tet offensive on this strategy. Much attention is paid to the impact of the Tet Mau Than 1968 General Offensive and Uprising on the minds of the US political circles and US society as a whole.

AB Using materials from the State Archive of the Russian Federation, the Scientific Archive of the Russian Ethnographic Museum, the Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History, the Archive of the Russian Academy of Sciences, this article reconstructs part of the biography of one "Stalinist" manager, Yefim Abramovich Milstein (1902-1989). Over time he was a student at the Institute of Red Professors (1929-1932) and then its deputy director and acting director (1932-1934), first secretary of the party committee in Makhachkala (1934-1936), director of the State Museum of Ethnography (1937-1941, 1944-1953), senior editor of the Division of Catalogs (1953-1955), head of the socio-economic literature group of the State Public Library (1955-1969), and, finally, a pensioner of significance (1969-1989). The restored biography of this "Stalinist manager" makes it possible not only to characterize this difficult period of Russian history-from 1929 to 1953-through the eyes of a functionary of the political system, but also to find a personal, individual plan for its reading. The biography of E. A. Milstein was schematically similar to the fate of other representatives of the party elite in the 1930s and 1940s, yet it demonstrated the specifics of his personal response to this difficult period of Russian history.

ID PRECARIOUS WORK
AB The dominating trend in the labour sphere development today is a social pollution from the economic activities of companies, which has a negative impact on labour relations. Reducing the social pollution level is hampered by the lack of scientifically grounded information and methodological support for monitoring, analysing and evaluating the social pollution factors and processes. The purpose of this research is identifying through an in-depth study the types and forms of toxic labour relations in countries with different economic models, as well as the development of new concepts and management tools for meeting the challenges of the decline of the social pollution level. In order to identify the scope and characteristics of toxic labour relations, a long-term monitoring study using quantitative and qualitative methods, including narrative analysis was conducted. In 2015-2017 toxic labour relations were examined in separate countries. Based on the results of the comparative analysis of narratives collected in the countries under study, factors of social pollution of the labour sphere in the part of labour relations between employers, managers and employees were identified, and the cause-effect relationships between toxic HRM practices and employees' well-being were investigated. Perception and evaluative judgments of the informants allowed the researchers to get an understanding of the qualitative characteristics of the toxic labour relations.

DE civil service; value paradigms of public civil servants; life strategies
   of a civil servant; image of public service; career
AB In the modern Russian society, there is a contradiction between the goals and objectives of civil service, its social relevance and applied nature, on the one hand, and the growing dissatisfaction of the population on the other hand. The article describes and analyzes the socio-cultural and value paradigms of civil servants in the Russian Federation, which define the characteristics of their activities. The authors emphasize the importance of a motivational resource such as socio-cultural and value paradigms in the process of reforming the modern institution of civil service. The research results revealed a number of problems. A significant part of the structure of life goals of civil servants is occupied by material interests; according to the respondents' estimates, the activities they do are not related to the categories of "favorite activity", "interesting job". Some government employees consider "service to the Fatherland", "useful contribution to the society and the state" as the main purpose for their professional activity. The research confirmed the hypothesis that the efficiency and effectiveness of occupational work of civil servants depends not only on motivational factors but also on life experience, moral principles, understanding of one's role in the process of implementing the state policy and life strategy. The routine nature of work does not live up to employees' expectations evening political activities and state administration. Bureaucratic values, lack of interaction with the external environment, authoritarian management style, and rigid subordination affect the employee's identity and behavior. Government employees due to personal characteristics and character specifics, assessing themselves and their experience higher at the career ladder, either search for a new position themselves, a different kind of activity to meet their life strategy, or stop developing professionally. Socio-cultural and value paradigms of government employees vary according to the category and group of positions. We also confirmed the hypothesis concerning the category "experts" of leading and senior groups of positions that public service is considered by employees and citizens not as a value-regulatory complex providing interaction between the state and the society in order to meet the interests of the latter, but as a mechanism for achieving financial success.

AB The article attempts to identify and analyze the key factors that determine the current state and prospects for the formation and institutionalization of Russia's national identity. The author attempts to answer the question whether the Russian Federation is a national state or a state of nations. The research is focused on the factors that cause the fragmentation of Russia's national identity, which faces numerous challenges related to differences in traditions, lifestyles, cultures, natural conditions, the historical differences in the development rates of individual regions, subjects of the federation, and nations. The author identifies the differences between the two main types of nationalism - civil-political, based on the institution and culture of citizenship, the idea of nation and national sovereignty, and the so-called primordial type, primarily or exclusively based on the ethnic criteria of understanding the nation and national identity. The author substantiates the thesis that the Russian nation and, accordingly, the Russian national identity are formed in the process of "remelting" the multitude of ethnoses in the single organic whole. In order to disclose the systemic and structural components of Russian national identity, considerable attention is paid to the factor of its ambivalence, the essence of which is that representatives of the vast majority, if not all the peoples of Russia, realize their identity simultaneously as representatives of the respective ethnic groups and citizens of the Russian Federation. The author shows that the process of forming a sense of socio-cultural, political-cultural, national consolidation of Russian citizenship and, accordingly, Russian national, civil or political identity, is still incomplete. The author deploys arguments designed to define the hierarchy of identities, based on the supremacy of all-Russian identity in relation to the ethnic identity, and draws attention to the fact of duality of the phenomenon of nation, formed both from below by the will of peoples, and from above under the leadership of the state. In this context, the article substantiates the idea of the decisive role of the federal center in the transformation of many constituent peoples into a single Russian polyethnic nation.

AB The modern world faces numerous challenges that ultimately have a worldview nature. Every person included in the global processes meets with many contradictions, the settlement of which determines the direction of different communities and the whole of mankind movement. Globalization which began and was initially conceived as a process of world economic, political, cultural integration, rapprochement of peoples, over time began to demonstrate its negative aspects: socio-cultural unification, standardization of human tastes and preferences, stereotyping of people's habits and behavior, weakening of traditional values and ties. At present globalization is opposed to a relatively new process of extending glocalization as the desire to avoid the extremes of globalization, to prevent the disappearance of regional differences, to preserve and strengthen economic independence and cultural identity. This inevitably puts a human being and the whole mankind not only in front of the need of extensive scientific, technical and technological, social and humanitarian knowledge, but also requires the development of the ability to comprehend the whole array of diverse knowledge obtained in order to efficiently, in activity-based way use them. Therefore, alongside with general ideas about the world, the important task is integration of diverse modern humanitarian knowledge into the overall humanitarian picture of the world. The article examines some key methodological issues of the formation of the humanitarian world picture, including the problems of the language worldview, and focuses on the teaching of the experimental course "Humanitarian picture of the world" in the framework of the model of practice-oriented training of Russian pedagogical staff.

AB This article explores the structural determinants of aggregate change in the party composition of legislative assemblies, i.e. legislative party turnover. To a large extent a product of electoral volatility, it has its own causal dynamics due to the differentiated impact exerted by electoral rules, party system properties, and institutional design upon the two phenomena. The empirical test on elections held in in electoral democracies of the world (1992-2014) demonstrates that the impact of institutional factors (including electoral rules, federalism, and presidentialism) and party system nationalization upon legislative party turnover tends to be mitigated in comparison with their effects upon electoral volatility, even though the direction of the impact is almost invariably the same.

AB The paper considers opportunities of application of sociological approach to identify mobilization of social resources within political innovations placed on on-line platforms. Formation and development of political innovations in the society is bound to resources' provision for new and adopted (transfer) projects. The complexity of such research is caused by vague characteristics and properties of the Internet users. There are conditions that likely influence the choice of participants/users of socio-political practices within the network community. The sociological survey deals with issues of resources mobilization in the region within financial support of the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR), Grant 17-33-01108 Mobilization of initiatives of local population in solution of social territorial problems. The paper suggests both traditional and new mobilization forms of social resources application within political innovations. Domestic and foreign studies note high potential of modern information and communicative systems. In this regard, the Internet communication demonstrates an opportunity to unite communicative practices of its users in time or even space (virtual). Gaming technology and various visual design tools are distinguished among modern methodological approaches, which are successfully combined with information and communication media. Political innovations in the Internet foster mobilization of social resources in their new form, place (space) and quality of socio-political communication. The study of social resources of political innovations within the Internet communications is a new methodological field of sociological study, which is characterized by flexibility of research levels, depth of study, modern research methods and conditions of "place" and "time" of participating parties.

AB Recently, the attention of STS researchers has shifted from assessment of the technologica development consequences to the analysis of "making the future". At the same time, not only rea and material objects, but also mental structures sociotechnical imaginaries, constructing the present and future of science and technology are in the sphere of research interest. An important element of these mental constructions is the imagination that determines the dynamics of socia expectations, the ways of "colonization of the future" and the strategies of managing uncertainty. Sociotechnical imaginaries may be of interest for understanding the NBIC convergence tha promises to solve complex problems in various spheres of society and actively mobilize social resources for the desired future, forming appropriate narratives and political rhetoric.
   Recognition of the role of imagination in science and technology policy involves the development of social technologies that are oriented toward proactive approach, anticipatory governance openness to criticism, and the active inclusion of social actors in the discussion of potential sociotechnical worlds. Technology of imagination allow not only to expand the range of factors anc effects that can and should be taken into account, but also to differentiate socially significant cost-effective initiatives and unpromising projects that will not bring the desired results.

AB The modern political science concentrates on case studies of constituencies' boundary commission. Less attention has been paid to theoretical or even complex descriptive study of the phenomenon. To fill this gap, the present paper advances the first analysis of the institution of constituencies' boundary commission. This paper argues that these commissions are a unique institution regarding the method of forming, position in the system of governance, and the mode of operation. They solve specific administrative and political tasks in redistricting process, which cannot be performed by election commissions or other bodies. The institute of boundary commission is the only known mechanism to ensure the full participation of experts in the delimitation process. The commission is to ensure transparency in the delimitation process, public participation and political representation at a highest level. The presence of a constituencies' boundary commission corresponds to a high stage of development and institutionalization of the redistricting process. At the present stage the institute of boundary commission has become especially widespread in countries with the governmental model of electoral management. Another prerequisite for the implementation of these commissions is electoral system with the single member districts. The empirical relevance of the findings is tested making cross-case generalizations in 25 countries. It is conceivable that there are no institutional obstacles to implementing the constituencies' boundary commissions in the countries with "strong" election commissions.

DT Article
DE resilience; sustainable development; foreign policy; security; European
   Union
AB In the recent years the Western countries have increasingly used the concept of resilience in the political science and politics discourses. This concept characterizes the reaction of subjects to the impact of shocks of any kind and origin, however, its conventional definition has not been elaborated yet. The authors have turned to semiotics as their theoretical basis and attempted to identify the nature of the relationship between the use of the term "resilience" in the scientific discourse and its application to political practice. They analyzed the scientific interpretations of "resilience" and forms of the use of this concept in the documents, which reflect the approaches to foreign and defense policy of the European Union, Germany, France and Britain. The study showed that the concept of resilience has a very broad denotation and a large number of connotations, which makes its use in the structure of discourse problematic from both syntagmatic and paradigmatic views. Therefore, according to the authors, the pragmatic dimension of the concept, i.e., how the concept is used and interpreted in foreign policy of different states, gains particular importance for comprehending "resilience". At the same time the very amorphousness of the term "resilience" broadens the freedom of maneuver by the interested actors when dealing with equally amorphous risks and threats to the international security, the proliferation of which accompanies the development of globalization.

AB The article evaluates the fundamental social factors which influence the formation of the axiological component of Russian youth's political consciousness. The authors have set a goal to find out to what extent the traditional moral and spiritual values are rooted in the minds of young people. These values need to be cultivated in accordance with the goals set in National Security Strategy of Russia, approved by the Decree of the President of the Russian Federation. Using the method of selective associations, the authors have identified the actual set of values, which form the stereotypes of political thinking of young citizens of the Volgograd region. It consists of such values as strong family, patriotism, strong state, love for neighbour, fortitude and faith. It's been found out that search for truth and collectivism, which once were the fundamental values for the spiritual life of the Russian people, ceased to be so for the young generation of Russian citizens. The authors point to the revival of the dualism of the concepts of patriotism and pride, which was dominant in the public consciousness of the Soviet people. Nihilistic and protest moods are peculiar of only a small share of youth (no more than 3 %). Many traditional moral and spiritual values remain rooted in the political consciousness of young people in Volgograd, and this is a positive factor of national security in the region. The authors have concluded that despite a number of negative societal factors that have a significant impact on the formation of value-semantic attitudes and stereotypes of political thinking of Russian youth, the traditional spiritual and moral values are still the important social regulators of political behavior.
   V.N. Gulyaikhin describes the main traditional values of the Russian people and reveals a number of fundamental factors of public life that have a significant impact on the formation of values and stereotypes of the political thinking of Russian youth. E.V. Galkina gives an assessment of the ideological context of the document "The National Security Strategy of the Russian Federation" and formulates the initial thesis about the need to view the youth as an active subject of the national security system. O.E. Andryushchenko develops a questionnaire for a mass survey of representatives of two age groups of young people, makes a sample for a mass questionnaire, and carries out an empirical study of the value-semantic attitudes and stereotypes of political thinking in the two main age groups of the Volgograd youth. P P. Fantrov carried out a comparative analysis of stereotypes of thinking of these age groups.

AB The article can be regarded as a contribution to the analysis of both the historical tradition and the prospects for social change in post-communist societies, taking into account the actual question of the extent to which contemporary theoretical debates reflect the real political, ideological and communicative trends in this region. The article raises a series of timely and acute questions about the modern condition and future of post-communism in the Central and Eastern Europe. The first part of the article is devoted primarily to the institutional and ideological aspects of post-communist transformations. These aspects are highlighted not by chance, because today there are many problematic research areas that are still historically and methodologically difficult to perceive by scientists as quite adequate research objects. In the theory of democratic transit, post-communism was initially viewed as a relatively short historical period that separated the dominance of authoritarian communist power from the triumph of consolidated democracy. In fact, the formation of the "core" of the post-communist institutional project, namely, the creation of political system that would effectively replace the old system with a minimum of transaction costs was the most difficult part of the process. The classical theory of modernization, forced to substantially restructure its methodology, nevertheless appeared, in the eyes of most Western scholars, to be much more suitable for studying post-communist processes than "transitology". The article explores in detail a very characteristic model of "antipolitics" implemented in most post-communist countries already at the first stage of reforms. In the scientific literature for a long period, the problem of the formation of ideological discourses in the post-communist world has received much less attention than institutional aspects. Analysts everywhere note that, at the present time, the formation of ideological discourse in post-communist polities is carried out for the most part situationally, depending on the emerging external and internal political conjuncture. At the beginning of the XXI century the disappearance of the dichotomy itself of "capitalism-socialism" from the mass consciousness undoubtedly strengthened the diffuse character of both mass consciousness and the emerging new ideological discourse.

DE new political language; intellectuals; mass media; manipulative

AB The second part of the article is devoted to the question of the role played by political communication and the mass media in the development of social processes in the Central and Eastern Europe. The study of paradoxical properties of the phenomenon of post-communism has become one of the most important incentives for the turn of the humanities in the direction of analyzing the specifics of the new communicative and rhetorical properties of political texts in the structure of ideological discourses both in Europe and outside it. The specific nature of post-communist social communication when ideological labels are often meaningless and exchangeable, and citizens remain unengaged in the political process, increased the role of manipulative factors realized through the media. This tendency initially manifested itself in various "mediocratic" projects and utopias based on the desire of politicized intellectuals to form a "new political language" and thereby strengthen their positions in political discourse, ultimately winning the legitimate right to power. The rapid evolution of the post-communist political discourse from "liberal humanism" and "universal values" to reactionary myth-making, nationalist rhetoric and xenophobia, clearly demonstrates that one of the main sources of constant ideological transformations in the public consciousness is the extremely contradictory political ideas and attitudes of intellectuals rushing into power already at the initial stage of reforms. At the same time, crisis situations, the growth of traditionalist nationalism indicate that pathological tendencies and changes in the structures of post-communist regimes have a systemic and global character.

AB The article examines the state and prospects of development of the Kurdish national movement at the present stage, analyzes the role and significance of the Kurdish community in Iraq and regional geopolitics. The author pays special attention to contribution of the Iraqi Kurds to the fight against forces of international terrorism represented by radical Islamist groups as well as to results of referendum of Iraqi Kurdistan on independence of the Kurdish region. Despite the fact that the outcome of referendum on independence of Iraqi Kurdistan has so far failed to be realized, a status of the subject of federation in Iraq enjoying fairly broad rights and powers allows Iraqi Kurds to successfully solve the pressing political, social and economic problems of the Kurdish region and to maintain their national identity. Many experts come to conclusion that Iraqi Kurdistan is becoming an oasis of relative stability and security in Iraq and the region as a whole. The issue of creating the Great Kurdistan is considered separately. Author believes that this project can hardly be considered real, since there is no single general Kurdish organization, ideology or leader today. The most vital problem is to achieve the unity of political forces in each of the Kurdish areas. The disunity of Kurds continues to harm the Kurdish national movement. Author notes that the greatest success in its self-determination was achieved by the Iraqi Kurds who have already enjoyed almost equal rights with the Arab majority of Iraq. In his opinion, a possibility of resolving all disputable issues between Baghdad and Erbil peacefully at the negotiating table has not been exhausted yet.

AB The article presents the results of the comparative study of political-ideological views of the Russian population on the values of freedom, democracy, social justice, the role of the state, etc. The research covers almost a quarter of a century - the surveys based on the same questionnaire were conducted among Muscovites in 1992 and 2016. The results of the comparative study show that the structure of the views on basic political values has not changed significantly. However, there are still different, often opposite social-political representations in the Russian society, which is clearly manifested when opposing freedom and inequality, democracy and socialism, social justice and individualism. Moreover, the shares of respondents expressing opposite views are approximately equal. At the same time, the attitudes structure revealed at the end of the last century has changed if compared to the data of 2016 survey, especially considering the role of individual activities in determining life trajectories. There is growing support for the importance of individualism as opposed to social justice and for the expectations of various types of state social guarantees. The results of the multidimensional statistical classification prove that there are several groups with different political-ideological orientations - from supporters of liberal democratic ideas to those who prefer socialist values. However, most groups still support the paternalistic ideas of the Soviet period such as the importance of social guarantees and social role of the state.

   parliamentarism; bourgeois parliamentarism
AB The purpose of the article is to analyze the evolution of the theory and practice of Russian parliamentarism. Methodologically, the article is based on theoretical developments of both foreign and Russian researchers. In foreign science, this problem is reflected in the studies of J. Blondel, J. Burdeau, M. Gunes, A. Daishi, R. Dick, I. Jennings, G. Ellinik, J. Coakley, P. Loesche, Th. Meaney, D. Olson, D. Ornstein, A. Fallback, W. von Alemann, E. Hubner, K. Schmitt and others.
   Russian scientists of the pre-revolutionary era made a significant contribution to the development of the ideas of parliamentarism. Not lost its value and is still relevant ideas, work and projects of V.I. Gere, V.M. Gessen, S.E. Desnitsky, B.A. Kistyakovsky, M.M. Kovalevsky, N.M. Korkunov, S.A. Kotlyarevsky, N.I. Lazarev, P.I. Novgorodtsev, A.N. Radishchev, K.N. Sokolova, M.M. Speransky, B.N. Chicherin, L.A. Tikhomirov and others.
   Theoretical foundations of parliamentarism at the present stage is presented in the works of such Russian scientists as L.I. Bachilo, N.I. Biryukov, O.N. Bulakov, M.V. Varlen, O.V. Gaman-Golutvina, A.V. Glukhova, G.V. Golosov, V.I. Mikhailov, A.V. Dementiev, R.J. Evzerov, A.D. Kerimov, A.I. Kovler, V.N. Kolesnikov, I.V. Kotelevsky, Y.K. Krasnov, B.S. Krylov, O.O. Mironov, T.N. Mitrokhina, M.A. Mogunova, S.P. Obukhov, J.A. Place, R.M. Romanov, N.A. Sakharov, V.M. Sergeev, E.P. Sokolova, I.A. Soloviev, V.E. Usanov and others.
   Traditionally, in modem scientific literature there are three stages in the evolution of parliamentarism, which correspond to its three historical forms: ancient, medieval and modem parliamentarism. We believe that such a classification can only partially reveal the content and essence of the historical forms of this phenomenon. For a thorough analysis of the essence of parliamentarism at each individual historical stage, it seems necessary to move away from the conventional periodization and propose a new one, which provides for four stages in the formation of historical forms of parliamentarism.
   As criteria for the allocation of stages and identification of historical forms of parliamentarism, it is proposed to establish: the presence and degree of implementation of the principle of separation of powers into the system of government; the status and importance of normative legal acts in society; the place and role of an elected competitive parliamentary institution in the system of authorities; the presence of an orderly system of formation of a legislative (representative) body; the presence of free organizations, associations that can aggregate the interests of different social groups of society.
   On the basis of the above-mentioned criteria in the formation and development of parliamentarism, we distinguish four stages, which allow later to identify the following four historical forms: protoparlamentarism, class-representative parliamentarism, bourgeois parliamentarism and modem parliamentarism.
   Analysis of the evolution of the theory and practice of Russian parliamentarism shows that this institution has a natural and historical character and is in constant development. Its evolution, the transition from one stage to another, is caused by the political, socioeconomic, cultural and spiritual changes taking place in society. Features of implementation of parliamentarism in various epochs of development of political system reflect a condition of the public relations, and conform to requirements of society. This institution, having realized its historical potential at a certain stage, creates preconditions for the transition to a qualitatively different state, which is characterized by new content and forms of institutionalization.

AB New trends resulting from the most considerable changes in the constitutions of the CIS countries and several other states of the former Soviet Union are analyzed. The constitutional model developed in Eurasian states of this region is transitional, incomplete, and hybrid, which predetermines the need for further modernization (novelization) of the constitutions. The common features of the initial period of independent development in this group of countries are undergoing substantial transformations; there have emerged multidirectional vectors of constitutional modernization with account for characteristic traits of the evolution of the political and legal systems of different states. The author's conclusions concern the regimentation of the foundations of constitutional systems, forms of state, and human rights-the main subjects of constitutional-legal regulation in any state and the most important objectives of constitutional reform for constitutions under modernization. Study of the trends in the constitutional development of the post-Soviet countries of Eurasia, which is of significant interest for political sciences, contributes to the elaboration of the theory of postsocialist states and their constitutions.

AB The article is devoted to the problem of the study and popularization of the Russian research and educational schools of journalism. The analysis was made on the opinions of the representatives of the leading Russian universities that prepare journalists. The author makes a conclusion about the applicability of the concept "research and education school" to the Russian journalism research practice. The author also states the importance of popularization of the unique domestic experience of research and educational activities in journalism. The Russian school of political journalism is considered as an example of a research and educational school that possesses the characteristics necessary for recognition in the Russian and international academic environment. It has established research areas under the supervision; educational programmes of the appropriate specialisation; programmes of postgraduate and doctoral studies and corresponding Dissertation Councils; and research journals that publish the results of research in the relevant fields. There is a detailed study of the contribution of the St. Petersburg research and educational school of political journalism to the development of the national journalistic education and the corresponding branch of scientific research. Among the achievements of the researchers of the School of Journalism and Mass Communications of the St. Petersburg State University, the author refers to: development of a conceptual apparatus and definition of the content of the research field devoted to political journalism; introduction of a special academic discipline of the political science of journalism into the curricula of future journalists of; the master's program in "Political Journalism" and defending of the candidate and doctoral dissertations in "Journalism" with the awarding of academic degrees in political science; the publication of a course book "Political Journalism" for high schools; the implementation of research projects on the relevant issues; thematic conferences; and publishing collections of research papers in political journalism.

AB The problem of mutual understanding between the fathers and the sons of Russian emigration in Europe in the 1930s. XX century is considered through the modeling of the dialogue between the authors - fathers-emigrants of the "Novy Grad", and the literary youth of Montparnasse - "the unnoticed generation". The project of the "man", proposed by F. Stepun and supported by G. Fedotov, became the ideological center of the "Novy Grad" around which the controversy of authoritative ideologists-emigrants of different directions was conducted. Turning to V. Varshavsky's book "The Unnoticed Generation", the author of the paper shows how the literary youth needed a Novograd understanding of man - an active transformer of social life, critically and at the same time analytically accurately diagnosing the foundations of the economic successes of the USSR, combining liberal values and criticism of the Western liberalism, deep Orthodox faith and the preservation of Russian culture in the West. Twenty years later, Stepun will come to the conclusion that the Russian emigration had more success not in the political opposition of the USSR, which was a utopia and turned into a collapse of illusions, but in the cultural mission of Russian emigrants who represented Russia's culture both for Russia and for Europe.

AB Introduction. The natural productive forces of each region have remained unchanged for thousands of years. The nature of their use is changing. Analysis of the process of construction of the Volga-Don channel in the scientific thought of Russia in the 18th - mid 20th centuries allows us to determine: 1) the formation and evolution of projects of infrastructure economic reforms in scientific and public thought, 2) the political conditions and reasons leading to their implementation. Methods and materials. The authors use the principles of historicism and objectivity, analysis, synthesis, historical and genetic method, systematic approach. The construction projects of the Volga-Don channel were discussed in the works of A.G. Brikner, S.V. Bernshtein-Kogan, V.F. Gnucheva, I.I. Golikov, A.N. Minkh, V.V. Bulatov, M.M. Zagorulko. These works deal with different options of project implementation and the possibility of its use on the basis of concession. Analysis. The paper analyzes how in the scientific thought of Russia in the 18th - 20th centuries different projects of connection of the Volga and the Don by the channel were created. The research shows that attention of the scientific society and the state powers to this scientific and technical question increased in the periods of the great reforms - in the times of Peter I, Catherine the Great and in the time of the Soviet economic reforms of the 1920s-1930s. From the beginning of the 18th century and till the middle of the 20th century empirical data on this problem were accumulated. Results. On the one hand, for over two centuries the empirical data on the channel construction had been accumulated, the focus had being shifted from the one-scale consideration of this problem as a transport and military-political one to the complex research of the channel influence on geography, economy, nature of the region. On the other hand, the most important details of economic model had remained unchanged, and finally, the connection of the Volga and the Don was carried out by the decision of the State power, with the use of unfree labor and was funded by the State, i.e. in the same way as it was planned in the times of Peter I.
   I. O. Tyumentsev has worked out the key conception of the work, carried out the academic editing of the paper. A. L. Kleytman has analyzed scientific projects of the Volga-Don channel construction in the 18th - early 20th century. T. B. Ivanova has analyzed economic and technological projects of the Volga-Don channel construction in the Soviet times.

AB Boris Kolonitskii continues his studies of the cult of Alexander Kerensky in 1917 and the larger issues of the vocabulary used to describe leaders and the nature of cults and their relationship to authoritarianism in Russian and Soviet history. He reviews the linguistic fields surrounding such revolutionary figures as Miliukov, Rodzianko, Chernov, Plekhanov and Lenin and shows how politicians may become hostages of their own rhetoric. Hero image terminology can sanctify the leader. But even negative publicity or criticism can lead to the strengthening of the cult image. The construction of cults is subject to reversals and shifting creativity. Cults have pre- histories and are vital to our understanding of 20th century politics.

AB The review presents an analysis of the results of studies of ideology as a socio-political regulator of modern societies. The authors view the modern world-economies as unfinished modernity; therefore, it is not necessary to move to a post-modern society, but to global radicalization of modernity. Since ideologies are immanent for modernity, it is too early to talk about the end of ideologies, on the contrary, ideologies will play a more significant role than before. Ideologies today primarily fulfill the function of justifying and legitimizing moral values. The ideology of today is no longer a political project, but a value regulator. When in the future there will be a transition from the world-economies (oriented to homo economicus) to the world-politics (based on the idealistic policy of universal values, confidence, deliberative democracy), there will also be a change of neoliberal meta-ideology to another, most likely, communitarian meta-ideology.

AB The article considers the formation of the national style of Turkish architecture in connection with the change of political rhetoric. Adjustment of eclecticism in the era of Tanzimat (mid-19th century) expressed in adapting of European historical styles to Ottoman conditions was replaced by an attempt to create its own neo-Ottoman style which corresponded to the development of the political doctrine of Ottomanism. After the Young Turks Revolution the national paradigm that had already been formed was declared a corresponding rhetoric of Turkism and was used to create the architecture of the first decade of the Turkish Republic. Thus, the same artistic realities were assessed in different ways depending on the political situation, and this approach is preserved in contemporary historiography.

DE imagology; image of Russia; Russian bear; propaganda; European cartoons;

AB The process of forming and changing the image of Russia-bear is analyzed. English, French, Polish, American and Georgian caricatures, engravings and lithographs, which appeared in the period from the second half of the 18th century to the present day, are used as sources. The problem of forming the image of Russia abroad is considered from the point of view of imagology and information warfare. The process of changing the image of Russia-bear is described depending on the political situation, on the direction and propagandistic goals of the printed publications. The study revealed that the associations of Russia with the image of the bear are extremely strong and acquired the status of a stereotype long ago. It is noted that this image has been successfully used as a weapon of political propaganda since the XVIII century. It is shown that the image of the "Russian bear" in the Western media constantly changes on the basis of the current political situation on the international arena. The authors assert that this image is practically not developed in the Western media in the context of constructive alignment of international relations, the destructive component of the image is usually emphasized. It is reported that, since 1977, attempts have been made in Russia to positivize the image of the bear in foreign media, but they have not been successful to the present day.

AB The interaction between Russia and Austria-Hungary in the field of economics, tourism, science and education in the last third of the XIXth - the beginning of the XXth century is considered in the material. The migration flows between two neighbouring Empires are analyzed as a separate issue. The article touches upon the interest of Vienna and St. Petersburg in growing links in these areas.
   The archive material, diplomatic documents, the contents of periodical press, statistic data and memoirs serve as historical sources for studying the given issue.
   Finally, the authors come to the conclusion that regardless intense political conflicts erupted between Russia and Austria-Hungary, a cross-cultural dialogue, economic links and migration flows are being actively developed between two Empires. The priority growing links of Russia with the Austrian half of the Habsburg Empire that was ahead of Hungary in economic and cultural terms and where Slav population played a greater role in socio-economic, political and cultural life of the society is underlined in the article. Non-political contacts aren't being reduced after the Balkan crisis in 1908 that put Russia and Austria-Hungary in a difficult situation being a threat to the beginning of the war. The given fact was manifested with good reason in the first half of 1914.

DT Article
DE Russia; Ukraine; business; foreign direct investment; Ukrainian crisis;
   investment strategies; nationalization; sanctions
AB Preliminary results of investment cooperation between Russia and Ukraine after the Ukrainian crisis are somewhat contradictory. On the one hand, the deterioration of bilateral relations and economic recession in Ukraine have led to a significant reduction of both inward and outward stocks of mutual FDI, the closure of several large enterprises and restrictive measures imposed by the new Ukrainian authorities on the Russian companies, businessmen and governmental officials. The alternative calculations provided by the experts of IMEMO give evidence that, contrary to official statistics, the mutual investments are still declining, the number of discontinued projects is increasing and the sectoral composition of FDI is becoming more and more primitive. On the other hand, many companies, both Russian and Ukrainian, demonstrated their ability to quickly adapt to changing circumstances, to improve their business operational processes, to establish new corporate brands and to find opportunities to circumvent the existing restrictions. The author concludes that the future of Russian-Ukrainian investment ties is quite murky. The anti-Russian consensus in Ukraine will hamper further investments even if the country's economy will grow at a stronger pace, because some of Russian companies are waiting for a more favorable business environment to sell their assets. In the long run, the so-called neighborhood effect, which was previously a serious incentive for mutual investment, will come to naught. When making investment decisions Russian companies will pay more attention to other factors, such as political conditions, business climate and Ukraine's new trade opportunities with the EU. As for the Ukrainian investments, they will mainly depend on the state of affairs in the Russian economy.

AB The paper is devoted to the analysis of ideological sphere of the former Soviet Union. The author argues that despite significant divergence of development trajectories of the post-Soviet countries, a number of general trends can be detected in their ideological sphere. In particular, we can highlight the role of nationalist ideology as the main symbolic resource for the post-Soviet elites that helps them to legitimize the status quo emerged after 1991. The importance of nationalism in the post-Soviet context is also manifested in the fact that nationalist discourse, being addressed primarily to the past, avoids talking about a project of the future, which, by and large, hasn't appeared in any of the post-Soviet countries. Another common trend for the post-Soviet countries is the simulative character of political ideologies that are nothing more than Baudrillard' simulacra. The author believes that the reason for this phenomenon is not so much the lack of democracy in the post-Soviet states, but rather the peculiarities of post-Soviet transformations as such, which have formed a kind of political elites aimed primarily at rent-seeking then at the public weal.

AB The Russian civil society and law-based state entered a new cycle of development, that began with the election of the President of the Russian Federation. The election campaign highlighted the political life of our society in the aggregate of the actions of state institutions, leaders, elites, experts and citizenswho made their political choice. This campaign provided the scientific community with an opportunity to reflect on the state of political culture of the society and state and on the demand for political sociology and political science in this regard, which continue to be scientific instruments of knowledge and management in the modern world.
   The main sensation of this campaign was the actual dysfunction of the "Yedinaya Rossiya" - the ruling party in the country. The current President of the Russian Federation V. Putin didn't take the risk to be the candidate of this party. The dynamics of the public rating of political parties shows that the party -political system does not have a broad social base in our country. To associate his name with the Yedinaya Rossiya would result in the loss of support of a huge array of voters who are willing to vote for him, but will not vote for a party, that, as sociology fairly shows, is now clearly experiencing a lack of trust.
   The correct definition of the direction of the vector of the current development of society is the strategically important problem for society and its political leaders. The trend of dysfunction of a number of world and local institutions and the rise of political culture contradictions are escalating in the context of the economic crisis. The dialectical nature of the global and local liberal political culture requires a systematic scientific approach to the study, measurement and investigation for the fundamental causes of crisis phenomena.

AB The article summarizes empirical results of long-term all-Russian sociological monitoring "How are you living, Russia?" held under the direction of the author since 1992. The author reveals the dialectical components of the modern global and Russian socio-political situation, the logic of the political relations transformation of the Russian state versus developed countries of the West. According to the author, after World War II the process of formation of the system of social and political relations within the boundaries of a more general process of global civil society formation began on our planet. On the basis of the speeches and decrees of the President of the Russian Federation V.V. Putin estimates are offered of the development of the post-Soviet social and political situation. Sociological studies show the dynamics of the relationships of Russian citizens to the President of the Russian Federation and the political institutions of the state, the policy pursued, relations between different social groups in the Russian society. Polarization of incomes has led to the formation of critical material and spiritual disparities creating a new socio-political problematic situation at the global and Russian levels. The digital technological revolution brings to the historical stage new avant-garde classes that begin to define the material and spiritual essence of the social and political future. In the digital age, the global contradiction of the cold war is replaced by a new confrontation that has arisen at the macro, meso and micro levels of the global society between the supporters of socially and nationally oriented sustainable development and supporters of the political ideology of global universalism as practiced by Trump. The peculiarity of the new global socio-political contradiction is that it runs not only between countries, military and political unions. It takes place within societies, structured on various social and class characteristics. On the basis of the social information and theoretical generalizations, the author offers feasible vectors of development of the situation in the country and substantiates preferences of integration for sustainable development.

AB The author examines the book of a veteran of the American military journalism Mark Bowden, based on a large number of archival documents and eyewitness of the Tet offensive of 1968. It is noted that M. Bowden acknowledges that the Vietnamese's desire to protect their independence was crucial in the political success of the offensive, while the Americans did not have such a strong motivation. The author agrees with M. Bowden's assessment of the mediocre decisions of the American command and the falsity of the American media, but argues with attempts to equate the actions of the NLF and the VNA with the actions of the American troops.

AB The study deals with the demand for a new job position known as the "Talent Manager" and best practices in talent management. Organizations need to implement talent management in a competitive market. Intensive development of talent management in the world brings to the fore to need for specialists capable of implementing a talent management system and moving from HRM to Talent Management. The aim of the research is to analyze the vacancies in personnel management in the Russian Federation published on the federal recruitment site Head Hunter (www.hh.ru) and to identify the trend of the development of a new job position based on the best practices. The study was conducted using content analysis. The content selection criterion data was the term "talent" focused on 2 aspects: the job title and job description of the vacancies. Based on the results of the content analysis, the demand for the position of Talent Manager in companies was revealed with the definition of leading. It was found that in some organizations talent management is already the main strategy of Human Resources management, while in others it is only one among other tools for the development of human resources. The development of talent management in the world leads to the emergence of new specialists capable of creating and implementing a talent management system in companies. In turn, this will push for the development of innovative technologies in talent management that can significantly increase business efficiency in all, especially high technology and high-tech industries.

AB This article reviews the key strengths and debatable issues in Thomas Piketty's Capital in the 21st Century. The authors fully agree with the view that Capital is the most significant book in economics published since the start of the 21st century but consider that this appreciation is based more on its persuasive style of argumentation than on the introduction of new ideas. The article notes that Piketty's central thesis about inequality is based on a huge research database in terms of global coverage and retrospective. The database was compiled through years of work with tax statistics archives, a method of gathering data that is not typical for mainstream economists. Another notable feature of Capital is the text itself - it is not overloaded with formulas, which makes Piketty's arguments even more persuasive. The authors point out that Piketty revives the political economy tradition of socio-economic analysis in a broad context and successfully combines it with modern methods of data analysis.
   The authors also point out the debatable ideas in Capital, particularly Piketti's aspiration to find universal principles of economic development. As a result, modern capitalism looks like the economy of the 19thcentury. This leads to an underestimation of the role of human capital and innovations in economic development and an excessively pessimistic forecast of the world's economic development. The authors consider doubtful Piketty's recommendations for counteraction to spiral of increasing inequality. The authors suggest that proposed measures could go against technological and institutional development when new technologies and "good" institutions enjoy a huge potential egalitarian effect.

AB Formation and development of the Talysh ethnic consciousness under the conditions of the Talysh 'geoethnic reserve' have been analyzed. Certain ethnoforming elements of the Talysh culture, i. e. factors promoting preservation of the basic constants of the Talysh ethnic consciousness, have been revealed. On the one hand, it is a cult of rocks, stones, groves and trees, and on the other hand it is worship of air, water, land and fire, which with the appearance of Zoroastrianism at first, and later of Shia Muslim, were not absorbed and peripheralized, but filled with new religious and ethical contents presenting moral and esthetic ideals of the Talysh people. The role of a myth and religion as an obligatory early stage of formation of the Talysh ethnic culture has been determined; regularities of formation of the Talysh ethnic consciousness have been shown; steps of ethnogenesis and a world view of the Talysh ethnos have been enlightened. Introduction of strange cultural tradition components could not eliminate the existing valuable attitude of 'the geoethnic reserve', but right opposite, they created syncretic environment stimulating evolution of the Talysh ethnic consciousness towards world judgment in the system of moral and ethical images considerably enriching the Talysh ethnos outlook. Having been formed this syncretic environment effected significantly the Talysh ethnos social attitude, as well as, predetermined a prevalent character of religious values in Talyshes spiritual and socio-political life.

DT Article
DE capitalism; expansion; commodification; limits of development; center
   and periphery; social stratification; political utopia; rentier society
AB On the basis of the analysis of the most recent tendencies in the development of modern societies, V.Martianov hypothesizes that capitalism as a historical phenomenon is experiencing a crisis of crises, because all of the methods previously used to resolve contradictions inherent in capitalism (such as geographical expansion of capital, commodification of different spheres of public life and creation of credit financial bubbles) have reached their natural limits. According to his conclusion, the crisis can no longer be resolved by economic means, because such a solution can only aggravate the structural contradictions of the world markets by inflating yet another financial collapse and/or the spatial transfer of the epicenter of the crisis along the center-peripheral axis of the world economy. The global decline of capitalism requires a political solution, which implies recognition and legitimation of the new political ontology (the erosion of basic economic classes, the rise of the prekariat and various minorities), transformation of the principles of social stratification and alteration of conditions for access of different social groups towards public resources.
   Obviously, a new configuration of social groups will have to reinvent the foundations for social harmony and distribution of public resources under the conditions of a society that lacks economic growth, mass labor and is characterized by the leading role of state. At the same time, under the pressure of the monetary social order the political format of nation-states provides fewer and fewer opportunities for an increasingly vulnerable majority. According to the author's evaluation, as the strategies of the expansion of free markets and complete commodification of social relations are depleted, rentier society, which is related to state, basic income and acknowledgement of the value of each individual outside of the economic realm, will become a more attractive alternative to the capitalist order in terms of both values and institutions.

DT Review
DE Siberian Khanate; Isker; Western Siberia; Siberian Tatars' economy
AB The publication of the results of the archaeological research of the Isker ancient settlement in 1988 and 1993 undoubtedly represents one of the most anticipated events for all specialists in the history and archaeology of the Siberian Tatars of the late Middle Ages. This monument represents the archaeological remains of the capital's center of the Siberian Khanate - the town of Isker - also known as Sibir and Kashlyk. It has been studied for more than a hundred years and the publication of the results is scattered across numerous papers in dozens of collections of articles, while archaeological materials are kept in several museums, including some outside the Russian Federation. All this significantly complicates the real study of this archaeological site and its role in the history of the Siberian Turkic-Tatar statehood.
   The book under review is divided into three conditional and very uneven parts. The first part, analyzing written sources, was written by V.V. Trepavlov, who managed to both inscribe this town in the context of Siberian history of the 13th-16th centuries and demonstrate its continuity with the previous political center - Chimgi-Tura. The second part, based on archaeological materials, was written by A.P. Zykov, who correlated archaeological research materials of 1988 and 1993 with the results of previous works. In the opinion of reviewers, the main weakness of authors' concepts lies precisely in this part, since it does not fit with the first part of the book. Finally, the third part of the book, written by P.A. Kosintsev, examines the controversial issues of the economic reconstruction of the Siberian Tatars of the late Middle Ages.
   The reviewers recognize the relevance of this publication, but they believe that some of the shortcomings of the archaeological methodology will complicate its actual use and many of the conclusions drawn will be further contested.

AB The author examines the history of the Communist Academy and distinguishes three stages in its development. The first stage (1918-1919) is connected with the activity of the Socialist Academy of Social Sciences. Its members implemented training and scientific functions. The second stage (1919-1924) is associated with the activity of the Socialist Academy. Its members implemented only scientific functions. Finally, the third stage (1924-1936) was connected with the activity of the Communist Academy. Its structure and functions often changed. The author examines the normative direction of the evolution of the Communist Academy and its real activities. The author claims that the Communist Academy was the "paper tiger": its quantitative indicators increased (departments, employees, scientific works, etc.), but its quality indicators did not (many departments and its employees did not work, scientific works were of low quality). The causes of the situation were external (the political situation) and internal (the peculiarity of the Academy's scientific works). Among other internal causes, there were poor funding, low-skilled employees, the work of the staff in other centers, orientation to comply with the policy of the party, etc. As a result, in 1936, the Academy was closed and became a part of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR.

AB Referring to materials from the federal and state archives of Russia and Ukraine, the authors analyse the preparation and implementation of the abolition of the Zaporozhian Cossack Host, carried out by the government of Empress Catherine II. Many of the sources have never been studied previously. The authors aim to reveal the causes and reasons for the abolition of the Sich, and the timeframe of the process. The authors consider the plans and projects for the abolition of the Sich from different periods and proposed by different representatives of the imperial authorities. The authors prove that the abolition of the Zaporozhian Sich was not a one-time military operation that took place on 4 June 1775. They study the means by which the Russian authorities tried to solve the Zaporozhian problem during the third quarter of the 18th century, reflected in the projects drawn up by M. I. Leontyev, P. A. Rumyantsev, and K. von Stoffeln. They examine the socio-economic, demographical, political, and other aspects of the domestic and foreign policy of the Russian Empire, which influenced the social evolution of the Zaporozhian Cossacks Host and led to its confrontation with the government. Additionally, the article considers the reaction of the Cossack community to the abolition of the Sich.

   competences; conduct seminars; hold conferences; large-scale strategic

AB The present day politicized lifestyle demonstrates the undisguised interest in the language of politics, which is aimed at manipulating of the mass consciousness. This peculiar feature of the language of political science is in the scope of interests for linguists as well as ESP teachers. Teaching a language to the students of political science requires the development of a special approach to its implementation. Theoretical elaboration of language and speech dichotomy has laid the foundation for the initial comprehension of the essence of language interaction as well as the development of new methods of teaching a language for professionally oriented purposes. In the light of the aforementioned dichotomy and the modern discourse theory relevant becomes the study of an utterance in a situational context which allows to distinguish linguistic competence as knowledge of the complex language system, on the one hand, and speech competence as a skill to introduce knowledge into practice, on the other hand. The interrelation of language and politics takes place within the frames of socially conditioned communication, which allows to single out some aspects of this interaction: the language serving politics is its prime instrument since political interaction is largely based on the language system; not only does politics exercise the influence with the help of language, but it changes the language itself.
   The pragmatic aspect is of primary importance within these terms. In teaching the language of politics we should take into account the fact that in politics action is reflected in the language, hence any utterance of politicians is regarded as an action in real life. In teaching English to the students of political science one should work out and implement a model of the process of competence development for the future experts in the field, theoretically explain the necessity of the applied methods and carry out an experiment revealing the required academic terms which contribute to the development of professional competence in political science the professionally oriented students in the foreign language. It should be noted that professionally oriented lexical and grammatical exercises alone are not enough to study all the aspects of the language. The teacher is to create special conditions to let students be immersed into the real professional atmosphere and imagine themselves to be real politicians. For this purpose serves the conduct of seminars in the English language for the students to discuss complicated political issues which will later lead to the faculty and then hold inter faculty conferences as well as large scale strategic role-playing games of the UN Model type. This work demands for special efforts from the instructor who is to develop a pilot testing programme aimed at the required competence development of the students of political science, to identify the necessary academic conditions for the purpose, to check the intermediate results as well as to analyze the outcome of the invented programme in terms of its effectiveness for the development of professional competence in the process of teaching English to the students of political science. The necessary level of assessment concerning the language for special purposes in the modern society presupposes special professional training implementation.

   convergence of Russia and the West; Russian path
ID RUSSIA
AB In Russia during the imperial and soviet periods society evolved from tradition to modernity. As a result, advanced industrial technologies emerged, along with the corresponding political, cultural, and social mechanisms that made possible the maintenance, use, and management of these technologies. Imperial modernization followed the classic European scenario. In its goals, means, and results Soviet modernization served as the continuation of this. While Soviet modernization was reminiscent of the classic Western model in some respects (the formation of the rational, educated, secular-minded individual; industrialization; urbanization; the democratization of the family; the emancipation of women and children), it differed from the model in others (the priority of the state over society, the supremacy of the collective over the individual, the restriction of the freedom of the individual, centralization, central planning). In sum, the formula of Soviet modernization amounted to technological and material progress on a foundation of traditional social institutions. Soviet modernization achieved a lower rate of development and came at a higher cost to society than imperial modernization. Nevertheless, were it not for the enormous and utterly unjustifiable human sacrifices, one could consider Soviet modernization successful even though, as had imperial modernization, it ended in crisis and revolution. Soviet modernization succeeded imperial modernization as a result of the armed revolution of 1917, while post-Soviet modernization replaced the Soviet version after the peaceful revolution of 1991-1993, but these facts do not mean that both modernizations never happened, or that they failed.
   Imperial modernization encompassed mostly the educated levels of society, the upper strata, a significant share of the urban population, and the part of the peasantry that supported the Stolypin reforms. The population groups enumerated here overlapped to some extent, hence their proportion of the general population barely exceeded 30-35 percent. The lion's share of the population, living primarily in the countryside, experienced modernization only slightly. Moreover, a significant part of this group reacted to fundamental modernization processes either negatively (such as commercialization and social and material bourgeois differentiation) or with indifference. Soviet modernization involved the entire society, and its effects proved to be deeper and more all-encompassing. Judging by the results of both modernizations, one can consider them fairly successful projects on the whole, although they also did not meet all the challenges and expectations placed upon them.
   Post-Soviet modernization also did not resolve all of the old problems and at the same time created many new ones. But it is far from complete and rendering a verdict on it is premature. Nevertheless, it is already possible to say that the political, cultural, and social rapprochement with the West over the last 20 years has been unprecedented in history. And this is natural: convergence had been the main trend in the development of Europe from the 18th to the 20th centuries, and in recent decades has transformed into worldwide globalization.

AB The religious education as a teaching on religion is an integral human right. The question is how to realize this human right in the modern plural society? The authors analyze the main strategies in religious education in Germany on the basis of international documents and the inter-confessional approach: the integration of religion into the mandatory school curriculum, the confessional religious education (partitive), and non-confessional one (unifying). The German's experience has significant importance due to the following: as a real pattern of the partnership between the state and religious organizations in the field of education in the framework of the State-Church cooperation model; due to availability of different approaches to realization of the religious education; due to reformation of the confessional education on the basic of ecumenism and tolerance; due to the experience in the field of the Islamic education. The authors study the programmes of the political parties during the election to the Bundestag in 2017. The religious education becomes a strong political issue, not only the social-pedagogical one. The detailed analyze of religious education in modern Germany shows that the trust in the Constitution, human rights, freedom of conscience and the broad social and inter-religious dialog promote unity in diversity.

DE empires; nations; nationalism; identity
AB The article focuses on the fact that in determining the formats of state-building and political organization of societies by modern historical science, not only national vectors should be taken into account, but also the diversity of imperial practices. The processes of state and nation building in the Imperial and post-Imperial dimension are analyzed on a broad historical material. It is concluded that the formation of empires led to the strengthening of the national at the expense of the colonial and to their active rapprochement. Colonizers and colonized in each historical situation by their goals, actions and inaction mutually determined the nature and dynamics of the relevant processes, re-perceived and identified themselves and the "other", while building social boundaries, highlighting cultural differences. Identity in the contemporary world is conceptually related to what is called the cultural frontier, when mental and cultural identity is not indifferent to the presence and ambiguity of the Other. A nation, a national culture cannot remain alone with its identity, so that distinguishes it from other nations, cultures. Identity requires communicative space and correlation with other socio-cultural fields.

AB The content of the concept 'social risks' has become a scientific problem for all areas of knowledge and social practices related to the study of uncertainty and its undesirable consequences. The author relies on the approach, according to which social risks should be interpreted as developing and manifesting themselves in the social sphere. The article analyzes the data of monitoring surveys of the Russian population conducted by the Institute of Sociology of the Federal Center of Theoretical and Applied Sociology of the Russian Academy of Sciences with the financial support of the Russian Science Foundation for the project "The dynamics of social transformation in contemporary Russia in the social-economic, political, social-cultural and ethno-religious contexts". The article shows the dynamics of some indicators of the changes in the social sphere: in addition to standard socialdemographic indicators, the author considers individual-personal ones such as emotional-psychological condition, assessment of the situation in the country, level of trust, confidence in the future, social orientations and preferences, satisfaction with different aspects of life. Based on the results of the analysis, the author makes conclusions of the theoretical and methodological character. For instance, the target-group analysis proved to be a method that expands boundaries and possibilities of interpreting data of the monitoring "contextual" opinion polls. Selection of subgroups of respondents according to the researcher interest allows to identify specific features within the general trends. The article shows that the group with negative assessments of social situation possesses the smallest resources to confront social risks and threats in all spheres of society. The estimates of the situation in the social sphere are determined not so much by socialdemographic characteristics or the level and quality of life as by individual and world-view peculiarities, especially by the perception of the state as the main adaptation resource.

   the standpoint of social epistemology
SO FILOSOFSKII ZHURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE political philosophy; political science; social epistemology; "natural
   attitude"; autonomy of the political
AB One prominent feature of contemporary intellectual climate is the current problematization of political philosophy (PPh). The author contends that the main challenge to this discipline came from the emergence of non-classical political thought in 20th century Europe, followed by the appearance of socio-epistemological (SE) type of philosophical reasoning about the meaning of the 'the political' in Lebenswelt. This challenge had important consequences: (1) the rejection of the traditional paradigm of the 'philosophy of politics' (PhP) which remained dominant throughout the Modern Age when political thinking remained a de facto part of the history of philosophy (HPh); (2) the emergence of analytical philosophy that left PPh wondering which of the methodological traditions of the Enlightenment were to be discarded. The publication of Carl Schmitt's theory of the 'autonomy of the political' can be viewed as a 20th century response to these difficulties. Schmitt's insistence on the autonomous nature of the political highlights the self-standing nature of the present-day political thinking as a discipline, its irreducibility to HPh with its academic tools, while drawing clear distinction between 'the political' and 'politics', the latter term signifying the sum of scientific disciplines known today as 'political science'. The author proceeds to illustrate the said distinctions with the help of the example of contemporary debates on the opposing categories of`structure' and 'agency'. In can be demonstrated that conflicting opinions in this debate are conditioned by the critical attitude toward analytical philosophy persistent in PPh, and, on the other hand, by its drift to non-classical SE. By sharing the SE thesis on the priority of Lebenswelt as against the 'scientific' attitude, PPh makes SE its own prime concern. This allows PPh to expose, among other things, the epistemic gap between the facets of political theory and leads to the conclusion that political science and PPh 'speak different languages'. Hence, among today's topics, there are those which can only be addressed within the problem field of PPh.

ID EVOLUTION; HISTORY
AB A series of independent calculations done by scientists from various countries and professions show that the 21st century is expected to be crucial for the human history. Current generations' activities will determine how exactly the turning point will happen and what direction the subsequent evolution will go.
   From time immemorial, the relative sustainability of human communities (from primitive tribes to nations, social classes or world confessions) has been provided by the image of a common enemy. Inter-group conflicts have been abridging in-group violence and with it, have been setting the vector for the creation of life's meanings. Yet, the current level of technological development completed by blurring lines both between war and non-war technologies and between the conditions of peace and war has made this psychological inertia suicidal. Therefore, the problem of life's meanings is becoming the nucleus of the 21st century global problems: Will the human mind prove ready to develop strategic meanings beyond religious or quasi-religious ideologies, which are always built on, the "them-us" mental matrix?
   Insights of great philosophers and prophets, as well as special socio-psychological experiments and some crucial episodes in political history have demonstrated that besides the image of a common enemy, both human solidarity and strategic meanings can be built on the image of a common cause (not aimed at an enemy agent), although the experience of assimilating this kind of construct by the mass consciousness is scanty. Instead, historical evidence is abundant showing that after long periods without real or potential wars, life's meanings "hang up" and the masses feel nostalgia for new demons. Actually, we observe an intensification of this trend in many regions of our planet accompanied by a growing instability in global geopolitics.
   An international educational program designed to develop cosmopolitan worldviews free from group-versus-group attachments is suggested in the paper.

AB The world is going through a transition crisis, which at this stage is stimulated by two factors - the consequences of the tour de force of civilization: the reality of a global mass society that has access to the achievements of the modern civilization, and secondly, the revolution of elites as a class and as individuals. The system of international relations is undergoing transformation, the sovereignties are redistributed and delegated, the nomenclature of foreign political organisms is expanding. The national state loses its former exclusiveness; other forms of political organization also compete in the international cosmos: interstate and supranational structures, system-countries, various kinds of subsidiarity autonomies and separatist formations; state-corporations and corporations-states, state-organizations with mobile borders, geo-economic integrations, influential anthropo-social communities - power outside statehood, that are renewing the system of world ties. The dispersity of the world order and cross-border mobility are growing, the world market is acquiring features of a special world order, the elite umbrella becomes more complicated as a regulator of power. The general trend of the historical process is the movement from the industrial and information landscape to the hilly landscape of the creative society. The toolkit of civilization is being updated, the imperative of the century is not the availability of traditional resources, but technological and anthropological advancement. The tuning fork: a complicated man in a complex world - the emphasis is shifted to venture personal coalitions instead of impersonal bureaucratic institutions. Institutions and rules play a smaller role. In the world, an influential character, manterpriser, manenterprise, is established as a dominant. Russia, in fact, competes today not with the US, Europe or China, but with a generalized "Elon Musk". Time turns out to be the basic strategic resource, it begins to dominate the shrinking (the effect of the development of physical / virtual communications) space. Movement replaces spatial organization as the dominant of social gravity and the essence of a new non-equilibrium system.

AB The authors consider the scientific works of the famous turkologist V.A. Gordlevsky (1876-1956), which are largely preserved in handwritten form, in particular, in the Archive of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and other archives. On the basis of the scientist's work, there is carried out the comparative analysis of the guild organization of artisans in the Crimea and in Asia Minor, with the study of craftsmanship of the Crimean Tatar masters, who produced casual leather shoes on the territory of the Crimean peninsula in the late 18th - early 20th centuries. There is emphasized the leading role of the scientist in studying this problem. The authors point out the features of his life and scientific activity, which affected the formation of his fundamental and profound knowledge of this issue. There are formulated the conclusions reflecting the main aspects of the craft culture in the Crimea The brotherhood of Akhi appeared and functioned in the Crimea as a voluntary union of the local professional and religious associations of guild craftsmen from the 13th century. In the opinion of V.A. Gordlevsky, these professional organisations played the leading religious, political and economic role in the region thanks to a "futuwwa", the statute of the craft unions, which in Crimea were called "selef-name" and included ethical and moral codes, such as generosity, honesty and modesty. In the Crimea, there also was a hierarchy of guild craftsmen; it included three main levels of the craftsmen (the student "shekird", apprentice "kalfa", master "usta") as well as administration headed by the supreme spiritual mentor of the guild "nakib" and the main masters "usta-bashi".

ID GLOBAL MEMORY; COMMUNIST
AB The reference to history in the context of Russia's foreign policy is considered as an appeal to the quasi-transcendence, whereby an ideal dimension is added to the practical (political, economic) aspects of international relations. It is noted that only in the 2010s Russian diplomacy began to pay special attention to such "symbolic games", designed to provide the moral basis for foreign policy through reference to the historical role that Russia plays on the international arena. This, in turn, leads to the dominance of performative practices, rather than to the building of dialogue spaces. In practice, the politicization of historical memory is conducted in two ways: inclusion in foreign policy discourse and by various symbolic practices of addressing to the common past during official visits. The author suggests distinguishing actual memory places and symbolic gestures aimed at their actualization. Russian-Bulgarian relations are characterized by asymmetry in the spaces of shared memory, memory places are mainly localized in Bulgaria. We outline main practices of turning places of memory into the common spaces of memory, but interpretations of these symbolic gestures in Russia and Bulgaria are structured by different national historical narratives. The memory of the Russian-Turkish war of 1877-1878 and the liberation of Bulgaria during the WWII are assigned greater importance in Bulgaria than in Russia. This asymmetry leads to the fact that a significant work of the Bulgarian authorities, Bulgarian and Russian public organizations on the arrangement of places of memory and setting up new memorials is invisible in Russia, while Russian foreign policy discourse is dominated by the emphasis on negative aspects (for example, actions of individual vandals to destroy the monument of the Soviet Army in Sofia). This deprives the ongoing work in the field of symbolic support and at the same time forms a myth of "Bulgarian ingratitude". The most striking example is the scandal during the 140-year celebration of the liberation of Bulgaria in March 2018, which is based on a different understanding of how the achievements of the Imperial period should be interpreted today.

ID JOHN POCOCK; HISTORY; DISCOURSE; LANGUAGE
AB The Cambridge School of political thought embraces several historians (John Pocock, Quentin Skinner, John Dunn) who began working at Cambridge in the 1960s and offered a unique approach to the study of social-political ideas. These authors insisted that political thinking is historical in its nature, and for that reason it should be studied in historical and ideological contexts. They also insisted that political ideas should not be considered as concepts that are separated from life or as a "tradition" which has persisted from Plato to the present.
   In recent years there have been attempts to adapt the method of the Cambridge School to a Russian context. The author insists that there are specific reasons why this is nearly impossible to achieve. This becomes obvious when the activity of the Cambridge School is situated in different contexts - in the context of the social and philosophical thinking in Britain of the 1960s, in the context of American political theory from the last quarter of the 20th century, and in the context of republican social philosophy of the early 20th century. One then finds first that the methodology of the Cambridge School went through considerable transformations as early as the mid-1970s; and second that the interests of scholars shifted either to political theory or to history for which their approach is not applicable for certain reasons. The author concludes that a continuation of the project of the Cambridge School is possible at best only in the field of contemporary social and political philosophy and not in the study of European political thought of the 15th through 17th centuries or American political thought of the 18th century.

DE Mongol Empire; Tibet; prince Godan; religious policy of the Chinggisids;

AB Research objectives: Analyzing characteristics of the legal status of Prince Godan, son of Ogedei Khan, who was often mentioned in different imperial, Tibetan, and late medieval Mongolian sources; clarifying the reasons why he was given the title of khan in some sources, though he never possessed this title. The author attempts to define the status, level of power, and real position of Godan among the Chinggisids and in the political structure of the Mongol Empire.
   Research materials: The basis for research comprises three groups of historical sources - Mongolian imperial historiography (works of Juwayni and Rashid al-Din, "Yuan shih", etc.), Tibetan historical works ("The Blue Annals", "Pagsam-jonsan", "Debter-chjamtso"), and late medieval Mongolian chronicles created under the influence of Tibetan Buddhist historiography ("Golden Tale", "Crystal Mirror", "Yellow History", "White History", "Jewel beads", etc.). The author also used the works of specialists on Mongolian and Tibetan historiography (such as Sh. Bira, R.E. Pubaev, Yu.N. Rerikh, A.D. Tsendina) as well as the works of researchers of political and religious history of the Mongol Empire (such as V.L. Uspenskiy, H. Franke, C.P. Atwood, etc.).
   The novelty of the study: It offers a systematization of historical sources of different origins to clarify some aspects of the political biography of Prince Godan, identifying his legal status as a Chinggisid and the ruler of an ulus. At the same time, the author tries to not refute sources with contradicting statements but to clarify the reasons behind such contradictions and to find information which could clarify and complement the data of other sources.
   Research results: The author tries to systematize different sources on the status of Prince Godan as one of the key political figures in the history of the Mongol Empire from the 1240s to the beginning of the 1250s and the ruler of a large ulus with substantial level of power, which could be compared with that of rulers of the Golden Horde, the Chaghadaid Ulus, etc. Also, the reasons behind the brief existence of Godan's ulus and loss of his status already by the time of his direct descendants are analyzed.

TI SIBERIA IN THE BIOGRAPHY AND LITERARY WORKS OF V.A. OBRUCHEV
SO IMAGOLOGIYA I KOMPARATIVISTIKA-IMAGOLOGY AND COMPARATIVE STUDIES
LA Russian
DT Article
DE V.A. Obruchev; Siberia; Tomsk; travelogues; The Sea is Noisy;
   feuilletons; On the Pillars; essays; Plutonia; Sannikov Land
AB The paper gives an overview of the Siberian episodes of the biography of the famous scientist and writer Vladimir A. Obruchev. From 1888 to 1912, he lived and worked in different cities, including Tomsk, for a long time three times. In the summer of 1888, Obruchev, a graduate of the Mining Institute in St. Petersburg, after completing his studies in Central Asia, was appointed a full-time geologist at the Irkutsk Mining Administration and arrived in Siberia for the first time. His letters can be read as a biographical text related to life in Irkutsk in 1888-1892, with studies of gold-bearing regions along the banks of the Lena, with work in the East-Siberian branch of the Imperial Russian Geographical Society. At the same time, they can be perceived as a regional text about Siberia, about its nature, geographical and climatic features, and about various peoples. In his second visit to Irkutsk, Obruchev spent four years, from 1895 to 1898, there. He studied the geological structure of Western Transbaikalia in connection with the construction of the Trans-Siberian railway. For the third time, Obruchev was in Siberia from 1901 to 1912, and this period is connected with Tomsk, where the scientist headed the Geology Department of the newly established Institute of Technology.
   The literary works created by Obruchev at this time and printed in metropolitan and regional periodicals are analysed. While still a student, he wrote a story called "The Sea is Noisy", which was first published in two issues of the St. Petersburg newspaper Syn Otechestva in 1887. While living in Tomsk, Obruchev again turned to literary experiments. He began to cooperate with Sibirskaya Zhizn', a newspaper founded by P.I. Makushin. Obruchev had a number of his political feuilletons published in it. In the archives of the Obruchev family, there is a story "On the Pillars", which tells about Obruchev's Krasnoyarsk impressions, and represents a historical and psychological story about young love, and how it is tested by the tragic upheavals of the revolutionary underground movement. In the story, Siberia is represented as a specific geographical, natural, historical, social and cultural space. At the same time, the ethical component in this universal description is significant in the story, for it makes it possible to perceive it as a topos associated with the existential choice of a person and with responsibility for this choice.
   Obruchev's idea of his science fiction novels Plutonia and Sannikov Land is analysed. In these novels, Siberia and its Far North are presented as a little-studied territory. The author dwells on the description of the geography and climate of Northern Siberia, the coast of the Chukotka Peninsula, the Bering Sea, the Beaufort Sea and islands located in the Arctic Ocean. At the same time, the writer perceives this region as a kind of future economic "reserve" of the humankind.

   allies; partnerships; world order; power; globalism; nationalism;
   transactionalism
ID HEGEMONY
AB After Donald Trump took office as President of the United States, Washington displays in many respects a new foreign policy philosophy, as well as non-conventional political practices. The 45th President has virtually resigned the liberal globalist paradigm, he is highly s.eptical about key transnational institutions of the world order, he would not hesitate to withdraw from key agreements signed by the United States if these agreements do not suit the current team in the White House. Trump's national capitalism, his trade protectionist practices have caused a major crisis between the United States and its partners and allies, enhanced tensions with rival states.
   The authors of this article compare basic philosophic and doctrinal elements of Trump's 'grand strategy' and major practical steps by his administration in the foreign and trade policies. The main conclusion from this analysis is that, despite Trump's obvious abdication of the U.S. leadership in the liberal world order and its institutions, he is in no way isolationist within the world system. This applies to everyone who takes office as U.S. President, irrespectively of his/her political views.
   Donald Trump's policies in 2017 and the first half of 2018 show that his America First rhetoric, his assurances of not seeking to impose the American way of life on anyone, do not contravene the use of force in conflicts in the U.S. interests, or widening the U.S. military presence abroad if Washington sees a threat to its vital strategic interests. This includes regions adjacent to the Russian frontiers. Power projection, as well as maintaining the U.S. - led security alliances - no matter how deeply they may be divided - is the key element of continuity in Washington's strategy. Increased tensions in the U.S. - Russia and U.S. - China relations are inevitable in these circumstances, since the Trump administration declared them 'revisionist powers'. Getting out of the deep crisis in the U.S. - Russian relationship becomes still more difficult and requires creativity and non-standard approaches.

DT Article
DE hakimiyya; legal domination; political domination; caliphate; din;
   Islamic state
AB The article analyzes the legal-political aspects of the concept of hakimiyya ("divine domination") devised by the Indo-Pakistani theologian Abul A'la Mawdudi (1903-1979). The author asserts that the doctrine of hakimiyya is based upon the recognition that Allah is the sole subject empowered to provide legislation to the Muslim community directly (the principle of "legal domination") and indirectly (the principle of "political domination"). The doctrine of hakimiyya acquires its political shape as the Islamic state (caliphate), wherein the Islamic community is entrusted with a limited right to legislation by means of agency (wikala). Special emphasis is laid on examination into the critical appraisal of the hakimiyya doctrinals in the modern Islamic legal science. The article explores the objections raised against the hakimiyya theory by the Indo-Pakistani religious scholars, including Abul Hasan Nadwi and Wahid al-Din Khan, as well as by a number of modern Arabic legal theorists, such as Hasan al-Hudaybi, Muhammad 'Imara, Muhammad Sayyid al-'Ashmawi, Haydar Ibrahim 'Ali a.o. The author concludes that the concept of hakimiyya underlies Mawdudi's doctrine of the sources of law and serves as the basis for his theory of the Islamic state, as well as for his concept of the "renewal of faith" through Islamic revolution.

TI LATIN AMERICAN APPROACHES TO GLOBALIZATION PROBLEM: A LOOK THROUGH THE
   21ST CENTURY
SO MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE globalization; Latin America; transnational corporations;
   transnationalization; national states; capitalism; integration
AB Four approaches to the globalization problem exists in Latin American global studies: apologetical, institutional, objectivist and critical, while two last of them are dominating. The apologetical one is represented by minority. Within the institutional approach, globalization appears as a function of transnational institutes' activities, is understood as a process controlled and organized by international financial and economic authorities. The objectivist approach assumes the attitude on globalization as a fundamental objective process - specifically as an asymmetric process in some sort, a theoretical "echo" of the dependent development theory, or "dependentism", once popular in Latin America, highlighting a structural division of the world capitalism system into center and periphery. In the Latin American authors' theoretical discourse, great attention is paid to political aspects and consequences of globalization. In particular, there are many fears and cautions before an eventual dilution of state institutes as part of this spontaneous process. Within the critical approach, the key concept is "neoliberal globalization". In the most explicit way, this approach is carried out by authors belonging to the Cuban school of Latin American global studies. The Cuban scientists use the "transnationalization" term as a synonym of "globalization". The most radical variety of the Marxist interpretation of globalization assumes its understanding as the highest and last phase of imperialism. A considerable part of Latin American authors investigates an alternative searching of globalization perspectives. In this regard, it is possible to single out three directions - sociocultural, ethical and integrational. The sociocultural direction is concentrated on the Latin American identity theoretical search. The ethical direction continues the Latin American "liberation philosophy" tradition. In the politological aspect, the integrational direction is elaborated the most. A common denominator of these theoretical views is the idea that the interstate regional integration of Latin America alone will be able to amortize risks and minimize dangers connected to globalization. It is viewed as a peculiar protective barrier against the impact of multinational corporations and supranational global control institutes related to them, both seen in Latin America as new forms of the U.S. imperial domination. Specific for this approach is its reference to the real international integration practice, closely connected to the "left turn" phenomenon. Since the beginning of the 21st century, the new integration architecture has been built in the region, targeting at the state national sovereignty protection. Summing up, the author proposes the following hypothesis: in the medium term, a "second round" of the international discussion on the "globalization" conceptual contents is quite possible as a result of large political and economic shifts on the international scene.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE economy of limited access order; dual enclave economy; innovation;
   institutions; routines; productive innovative entrepreneurship
AB The paper analyzes the institutional characteristics of the productive entrepreneur, aimed at creating innovations in "resource-type" regions of Russia. The modern Russian economy has features of dual enclave economy with an isolated export-oriented commodity sector. Based on the previous hypotheses on the relationship between institutional systems and types of entrepreneurship, a research is carried out on presence of "non-productive entrepreneurship" determined by the prevailing model of the institutional environment of limited access order, what is typical for the dual enclave economy of Russian "resource-type" regions. On the basis of sociological studies conducted in resource regions of the Krasnoyarsk krai and the Kemerovo oblast, it is concluded that productive entrepreneurs do not become actors of change because of such elements of the limited access economy as weak protection of property rights, a state manipulated, formed on the basis of the ruling coalitions consisting of the bureaucratic structure and large business, weak sanctions for rent-seeking. The transition from an innovative system of "technological push" (fundamental knowledge demanded by the state) to an innovative system of "market pull" (innovation demanded by business) is impossible in a way traditional for highly developed economies of the Western type through, what is true both for the Russian economy as a whole and for its resource regions, in particular. In order to form a new type of social contract between government, society and business with an institutional environment of order more "open" for an access to political and economic trades, it is more reasonable to transit to the mobilization model of the "triple helix" building the relevant relations within the development institutes of the Russian regions (strategic partnership of science and education, business and government, and the population).

LA Russian
DT Article
DE RCP(b); Leningrad; intra-party discussions; zapiski; rumors
AB The paper examines how political moods were expressed in zapiski that were submitted during district party conferences in Leningrad in 1925. In those zapiski, one can see what themes and questions were important for the delegates of the conferences. Delegates posed questions which they considered important for themselves regardless of what themes were discussed by the speakers from the regional party leadership. For example, delegates were not very interested in the question of "deviations" in the party politics in the village in contrast to the Leningrad party leadership. The analysis of zapiski reveals the lack of information on the issues of intra-party debates and the ignorance of causes of some decisions of the party leadership concerning Leningrad. The lack of information reflected in zapiski was a factor generating rumors. Delegates of district party conferences were sensible to those decisions of the Party's Central Committee that could symbolize the changing of Leningrad's status in the intra-party hierarchy. The article argues that, in 1925, the Leningrad party leadership sought to hide the existence of intra-party controversies; the Leningrad leadership was forced to self-censorship and to avoid discussions during such official party gatherings as district party conferences.

TI THE PHENOMENON OF TAHARRUSH AS COLLECTIVE SEXUAL VIOLENCE
SO LOGOS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE sexualized violence; taharrush; publicity; instrumentalization of
   violence; struggle for power; west-east
AB The article analyses the phenomenon of collective sexual violence which was clearly manifested in Germany and is associated with the influx of refugees and migrants in the last few years. In seeking to explain this phenomenon as the export of gendered forms of violence, the author explores its origins by means of a secondary analysis of monitoring data, tracking the escalation and discontinuities in the practice of applying sexualized violence associated with the political struggle during the two Egyptian revolutions. The conjunction of gender, ethnicity, social problems and the crisis of power that appears in a number of monitoring studies indicates that political values were introduced into sexualized violence or that sexual violence was converted by political forces into an instrument in the struggle for power. The practice of collective sexual violence called taharrush and its legitimation in the discursive space of modern Arabic culture have taken shape in this particular context.
   The practice of taharrush has contributed for a decade directly and indirectly (through discursive legitimations) to the masculine socialization of young generations of Arabic men. This type of masculine socialization is built on certain social norms that justify the use of violence against "transgressors" and establish moral and religious boundaries for women, and it is also associated with the potential for performing violent acts in public spaces. The experience of participation in the Tahrir uprising as a symbolic achievement of hegemonic masculinity made it possible for those who were subjected to economic deprivation through unemployment to compensate for the gaps in their masculinity and thereby restore male hierarchies. Reconstruction of the Taharrush phenomenon in the different, more Western context of emigration may be explained not only by the economic, social, psychological, and sexual deprivation of refugees from the Arabic world, but also as a form of socialization through equivalent direct and indirect practices.

DE Russian revolutionary movements; Russian populism; investigative

AB The reign of Alexander II was one of the most important phases in the political development of the Russian Empire. In the 1860-70s, a new political space was formed, where it was possible to realize new political actions. The paper raises the issue of how new political movements were perceived and constructed by different actors. The study of revolutionary activity is a guide to this political space. Therefore, investigative materials made during the inquiry of the case of "propaganda in the empire" are used in the paper. This political affair concerned a well-known event, named "going to the people". The methods of social network analysis are used in the research. This approach makes it possible to study the structure of the political movement through the visualization and analysis of a social network. The constructed model is a whole social network of revolutionary communities in Moscow in the first half of the 1870s. It is drawn from investigative materials and represents the views of the political police on the revolutionary movement. The protest movement in the 1870s was rather a complex intertwining of relationships, ideologies, political orientations, and not a world of united revolutionary groups. The movement was extremely inconvenient for perception. Therefore, the investigative bodies tried to unite this multidimensional political space and to make it accessible to interpretation.

TI Ideology in Late Modern Society: Disappearance or Transformation?

LA Russian
DT Article
DE ideology; post-Soviet Russia; modernity; late modernity; socialism;
   conservatism; liberalism; values
AB The article is devoted to the analysis of the specific role of ideology in the political reality of late modern society. The authors describe a notable contradiction between a steady interest of social science to the competition of ideas of the development of society and the growing doubts of the applicability of classical theories of ideology for describing and comprehending such a competition. The theoretical analysis of contemporary social theory shows that ideology can be described as an action-oriented system of beliefs, and that there are different views on the status of such systems in the political reality of late modern society. During the theoretical analysis, the authors conclude that the idea of the disappearance of ideology from the political process of late modern society has an important conceptual argumentation, but it does not find any cogent empirical evidence. It is more likely that ideology does not disappear from the political reality of late modern society, but it changes to meet new social requirements. Late modern society creates special conditions for the manifestation of ideology by diversifying the information field, reducing the role of political parties, discrediting many fundamental ideological projects, and reducing the class struggle. Altogether, these conditions make ideology change, but they do not make it disappear from the political reality. This hypothesis is correlated with the data of the sociological research conducted by the authors on the case of ideological competition in Russian society before the parliamentary elections in 2016. The analysis of the data of this research shows that ideology still exists in contemporary Russian society, and allows its description as a hybrid in the value kernel and local in its rhetoric system of beliefs. Thus, the authors conclude that it is possible to describe the political processes of late modern society with using the term "ideology". The term "ideology" which does not lose its heuristic possibilities, but requires a "reconfiguration" of the methodology of social science.

SO LOGOS

DT Article

ID CONTROVERSIES
AB Attempts to find alternatives to totalizing (which appears in the social sciences as explanations via society, class, gender, culture, etc.) and essentializing the understanding of the social lie at the heart of the contemporary efforts in the social sciences to appeal to a concept of multiplicity that enables rendering reality not only as various and fragmented, but also as inconsistent, complex and variously distributed within itself. Psychology, economics, political theory and many other disciplines have offered their own ways of conceiving multiplicity. In sociology the most well-known attempts to use this concept are by the neo-Marxist authors Michael Hardt, Antonio Negri, and Paolo Virno, and other such attempts are found in Schutze's phenomenological sociology as well as in the Goffmanian tradition.
   The article provides theoretical and methodological explications of the multiplicity concept in actor-network theory. In the theoretical terms, it is argued that Annemarie Mol and John Law make the distinction between multiplicity and plurality without resorting to relativism and social constructivism. They employ multiplicity to analyze the decentralized, distributed objects which combine actual existence with the potential to change. The methodological approach of the article is to delineate and analyze the foundations of three methods of explicating multiplicity in actor-network theory: the ethnographic one (Annemarie Mol, John Law, Charis Thompson), the "technological" one (Noortje Marres, Albena Yaneva), and methods of making conceptual figures (Donna Haraway, Michel Serres, Isabelle Stengers). The author maintains that the juncture between theoretical and the methodological consideration of the concept of multiplicity enables actor-network theory to provide definite ways to carry out enactments of social reality rather than merely describing it.

TI Political economy of Vladimir Putin: A view from China
SO VESTNIK SANKT-PETERBURGSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-EKONOMIKA-ST PETERSBURG
   UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
LA Russian
DT Article
AB This article is written as a response to the book by Chinese economists Guan Xueling and Zhang Man, devoted to the analysis of Russian economy and politics. It is distinguished by a thorough understanding of the Russian problems. The peculiarity of the book is that the policy pursued in our country, and it is defined as the political economy of Vladimir Putin, is, in its main content, referred to a realistic trend in economic science. From this "ideology of realism" point of view, the main characteristics in the reform of modern Russian society's reform have been considered. In the book they are presented as follows: a) the formation of an etatism policy with an emphasis on the centralization of the power resource; b) a bet on mixed forms of ownership and the use of selective protectionism with clearly defined goals; c) anti-Westernism and neoconservatism in ideology, reliance on patriotism and revival of national traditions. The authors paid much attention to the problem of using the raw material potential in the country's economy, which is considered in the context of creating a Russian version of resource nationalism. They justly prove that, from the point of view of realistic political economy, abundant resources "is wealth given to the state by forces from above, they cannot be a curse". The interpretation of the problem of Russia's geopolitical choice through a comparison of the two alternatives: "neo-Eurasianism" and "Euro-Atlanticism" is also of interest. It is clear that the Chinese authors have their own powerful arguments in favor of the eastern strategy for Russia. Of course, the book could not reflect the whole range of problems of Russia's development, it also has arguable issues, but this does not detract from its merits. It makes an appreciable contribution to the study of the problems of Russia by foreign authors.

AB The article analyzes the process of the establishment of archival continents of the Russian diaspora and the causes of the emergence of foreign archival Rossica. The article reveals the influence of migrations on this process. Authors show the diversity of archival materials on the Russian history which are kept outside Russia and often scattered in different archival collections, private and public archives and libraries. The emergence of communities of the Russian diaspora in several countries of the world led to the formation of extensive archival heritage. The study of this heritage is one the most urgent contemporary problems. The activities related to the discovery, restitution to Russia and use of this heritage have significantly increased in the last decades which is connected with the change of the political situation, researchers' gaining access to the archival collections of the Russian diaspora. The relevance of this fundamental research problem is enhanced by the necessity of eliminating the existing information gap at the current stage of the Russian history development - to reveal the information concerning foreign archival Rossica, the documents of the Russian diaspora and their locations in foreign archives and compile them in the unified information data base. The identification of the location of different documents of this group is aimed at the reconstruction of the integrity of the scattered archival collections by means of both restitution, exchange or copying of the documents and by means of virtual unification, for example, in the form of digital archive. These activities will also contribute to solving the problems related to the restitution of the archival heritage.

AB The article studies the ambivalent state policy in legalization of religious organizations in the post-war USSR. It focuses on the acute conflict between religious dissidents - members of the Evangelical Christian Baptists (ECB), led by the Council of Churches of the Baptist Church, and the Soviet authorities in the 1960s and 1980s on the issue of state registration of the communities. The first introduced documents of the CPSU Central Committee, the Council for Religious Affairs under the USSR Council of Ministers and the USSR KGB indicated that targeted intervention and tight control by the Soviet state triggered a response from religious nonconformists in the early 1960s. They began to perceive registration as a gross violation of the rights of believers and intrusion into the internal life of church. In turn, by the beginning of the 1970s, the authorities regarded the refusal of registration as the main threat to the political and ideological concept of loyal Soviet church. Thus, the authorities used a range of political, ideological and repressive measures aimed at forcing the supporters of the Council of Churches of the European Baptist Union to declare their loyalty and get registered. However, the efficiency of these measures was relatively low, since the faithful actively defended their religious freedom.

DT Article
DE political perception; country's image; image of government; image of the
   people; political context; factors of perception; identity
AB The article is based on the materials of the study of the perception of Russia by its citizens, implemented at the Department of Sociology and Psychology of Politics of the Faculty of Political Science of the Lomonosov Moscow State University. The research technique of the study included methods of semi-structured interviews and projective tests. To interpret the data, the authors used both qualitative and quantitative methods, in particular, coding and scaling answers to open questions and statistical analysis. As a result of the empirical analysis, the authors revealed certain features of the formation of the image of Russia in the minds of Russians regarding their rational and unconscious perceptions of territory, people, government, political leaders and the role of the country in the international arena. The authors also tracked the impact of certain factors on this process and recorded differences in the image of Russia among residents of different regions.
   According to the conclusion of the authors, although the process of the development of the image of Russia and the formation of the Russian national-state identity has been going on for as long as a quarter of a century, it is still far from completion. The psychological state of Russian society is extremely volatile. The revealed distrust of the citizens towards the government and the state proves that the negative trends dating back to the 1980s that led to a serious complex of "national inferiority" have not been completely overcome. The rise of national pride that took place in 2014 has not yet taken root.

DT Article
DE identity; methodology; interdisciplinary analysis; political psychology;
   uncertainty
AB The author discusses problems of identity presented in the 2017 publication of an encyclopedical volume edited by I.S. Semenenko through the lenses of political psychology. Methodology is one of the main lines of discussion in the study of identity. Analytical work made by the authors of this volume has shown that linking of different levels and areas of research is still a problem that needs to be solved; otherwise, all the construction of identity theory is in risk to stay a simple collection of particular disciplinary models. Another line of analysis is a "human" or "subjective" dimension of politics that was discussed in the book. This approach is close to political-psychological one. One of the most important topics of this volume is a topic of social relevance of identity theory, its capability to answer the real political issues that challenge this theory. Among those issues that make identity theory so popular in recent decades one can name such new phenomena as globalization processes, market pressure that transforms individual into a mere consumer, new forms of communication that produce specific forms if internet identities. An important phenomenon connected with identity is an asynchronism of political, social and cultural transformation with their reflection in people's minds in a process of identity formation. This "effect of delay" demands a thorough psychological analysis as it causes multiple new threats and challenge. Principal uncertainty is one of its consequences. Individual cannot reach any particular identity and adjust himself to this uncertain reality.

DT Article
DE Eurasian integration; Great Silk Road; BRICS; EEU; Russia; China
AB This paper analyzes institutional bases of the Eurasian integration, the role of China and the Eurasian course of Russia's development. The Eurasian regional centers are looking for additional opportunities in international cooperation largely determined by geoeconomic mechanisms. In addressing this issue, the paper clarifies relations among Eurasian countries-leaders (China, Russia and Kazakhstan) and provides a systematic review of regional organizations. Threats of the Eurasian development are both internal (economic recession, separatism, drugs and weapons transit, environmental problems, internal conflicts) and external (the U.S. presence in the region, growth of terrorist groups, extremism, nuclear arms race). Special attention is paid to the potential of the Great Silk Road (GSR) as a factor of national and cultural rapprochement. The Chinese GSR project promotes unity of the regional organizations' efforts, creates an image of Eurasia as a complete political and economic institution, economic and cultural "bridge" between Europe and Asia. The article argues that the Great Silk Road is a prerequisite for the revival of the states' economic capacity as well as for strengthening of the Eurasian integration. Thus, modern Eurasian integration is a politically constructed space that emphasizes civilizational complementarity, peaceful coexistence of peoples, and formation of an "interaction zone". However, the future of the Great Silk Road project depends not only on economic policy and ability to resist external destabilizing factors, but also on the involvement of Eurasian population into integration processes, daily practices of interaction and cross-cultural dialogue.

AB In the modern world there is a steady increase of scientific interest for the problems of state borders and border areas. This is due to trends of inter-civilizational and cross-cultural interaction, economic globalization, dramatic changes on the political map of the world, the democratization of information processes, and development of regional cooperation. Area studies emerged as a branch of science that studies, i.a., the spatial organization of the economy. The emerging new direction of cross-border regional studies is also focused on the economic issues of cross-border cooperation, which is new for the Russian regions. In the 1990s, the practice of these relations has evolved at a rapid pace leaving theoretical foundation and design within the framework of the scientific terminology behind. The border area, as part of the country, absorb the general tendencies of economic processes, and especially due to the peculiarity of geographical position. The same applies to socio-psychological processes. But if the economic potential, economics of frontier regions is reflected in the scientific literature, human potential, spiritual sphere, the state of the mass consciousness of various groups of the population are less studied, though, these factors are basic for social development. The article is devoted to the comparative analysis of the worldview, beliefs and attitudes of student youth of the Western and Eastern border regions of Russia.

DE Walter Benjamin; "The Moscow Diary"; Russian revolution; communal

AB In The Moscow Diary, Walter Benjamin tries to avoid value judgments: he declares his aim is rather to "record" the facts. The objective of this article is to make explicit Benjamin's evaluation of what he sees in Moscow by confronting Benjamin's Moscow observations to his political and aesthetic expectations described in his earlier writings. First of all, Benjamin discovers some alarming political signs in Moscow, the most important of which is the growing bureaucratization. In the Moscow of 1926, neither proletarians nor even "NEPmen" (a "relic" of capitalism) are the ruling class: the power belongs to the Party bureaucracy. Benjamin's concern regarding the political situation coincides with his concern of an aesthetic kind. What Benjamin observes in Moscow contradicts his idea of the "aesthetic revolution" as carnival (see Naples). As argued by the author of The Moscow Diary, the Russian revolution generates forms of alienation even more serious than those generated by the capitalist system. The article analyzes only one motive from The Moscow Diary-that of fragmentation of bourgeois dwellings.
   Cohabitation in communal apartments occurs due to a lack of alternatives, and is not voluntary. As a result, the inhabitants of Moscow's communal apartments are alienated from their dwellings, and the ideal of the commune as the voluntary cohabitation of people is flouted. Besides that, the fragmentation of bourgeois dwellings coincides with the fragmentation of the "building interior," i.e. the collections of rare objects and pieces of art which were kept there previously. The only acceptable form of transformation of bourgeois interior that Benjamin observes in Moscow is its museification. Only Moscow's museums, where the proletariat feels at home, allows him to hope for a successful outcome of the Russian revolution.

ID TECHNOLOGY; STRATEGY
AB In the theory of public policy, it is essential to find a fair procedure that could be used to obtain an equitable result in the course of choosing and making public decisions. Blockchain, as a network of distributed registers, is often positioned as a political institution that ensures the fairness of decisions by voting on the basis of a pure procedure. Political theory distinguishes between pure, perfect and imperfect procedural justice. The last two types of procedural justice are based on the criterion of a fair result, which is achieved on the basis of a perfect and imperfect procedure. Pure procedural justice is indifferent to a certain resulting criterion; it can be used to solve any issues. This article analyzes the political ontology of the pure procedural justice of blockchain technology, which relies not on the legal nature of the constitution of interaction in the network, but on the technical and social immediacy of cooperation and joint production. These qualities of pure procedural justice in the blockchain, as shown in the article, are provided by the relevant protocols and create the conditions for maintaining a reputation, forming an autonomous identity and building a special trust regime. An equally fair consensus procedure based on reciprocity and autonomy is also important. The article proves that such an institutional configuration of the blockchain acts as an analog of the political concept of J. Rawls's justice as honesty. The empirical basis of the study is the analysis of cases of using blockchain-voting on the platform "Active citizen" (Moscow).

AB The paper concerns administrative reform in the BRICS countries as a requirement of inclusive economic growth. The relationship between economic growth and equity describes the concept of inclusive development. In this respect, justice and quality of life is becoming one of its key factors and a stimulating cause of long-term economic development. The concept of an equitable (inclusive) growth strategy is based on the premise of the unity of governability, competitiveness and public policy through citizen participation. An important association of governability, competitiveness and fairness is participatory institutions. Four of these are crucial: strategic policy institutions; institutions of decentralization; institutions of "open government", and accountability institutions. The paper, based on analysis of the BRICS, demonstrates that these not only create an environment for development, but are also tools for citizens' participation.

ID RUSSIAN-ORTHODOX-CHURCH
AB In recent years, the defense of traditional values became one of the soundest strategies of religious authorities, as well as political powers in Russia. The author observes main arguments in the debates on traditional values presented by the hierarchs of the Russian Orthodox Church and political leaders, and figures out basic principles of the discourse: the "continuity" of the core values of Russian culture through its history; the opposition of Russia and "The West" as a significant reference point, which seems to be a recurrent thing in Russian identity building; the indissoluble link between [traditional] religion and morality. The author concludes that significant shortcoming of the ideology of traditional values is that they exist only on a discursive level, not manifesting themselves in everyday moral practices, although should contribute to the formation of national identity. Hence, the ` traditional values' discourse is aimed at the cohering the nation around certain meanings that are assumed as obtaining both historical and ideological integrity.

AB The article raises the relevant problem of the popularity of social democratic values in Russia and the difficulties of their ontologization in the modern political process. The modernization project of Russian statehood needs further theoretical development of the social-democratic idea in relation to Russian conditions. The axiological proximity of the social-democratic ideology to the needs of Russian society is, however, possible with regard to the pluralism of the argumentation of the basic values - freedom, social justice, equality, democracy, solidarity. The axiological pluralism makes Russian specificity acceptable in interpreting the values of social-democracy taking into account the peculiarities of the Russian historical path and the spiritual state of society. The "third way" for modern Russia is real in implementing the transformation of Russian statehood on the basis of the values of democratic socialism (social justice, equality, freedom, solidarity) and the concrete political, historical and cultural dimension of the nature of modern power.

DE A.F. Losev; school; knowledge; publicist article; mythology;

AB The article precedes the publication of the previously unknown A. F. Losev's journalistic opus The organization of the secondary school (see Appendix) and refers to the early period of the philosopher's work (late 1910s-1920s) the time of his greatest social and political activity. The main attention is paid to Losev's political journalism relating to 1918, devoted to problems of school education. The socio-political context that provoked the appeal of the young philosopher to this problem is revealed. At the same time, the aim is to enter this political journalism into the philosophical context of Losev's creativity. This approach helps to see the connection of Losev's reflections on the organization of school education with his reflections on the introduction of the human person to higher knowledge to faith. The author shows that Losev's thought is gradually moving from the analysis of political reality and solving the problems of spiritual education of the child to the consideration of the problem of objective truth and its historical transformations and, further, in the books of the 1920s and in the artistic prose of the 1930s, to the reconstruction of various types of thinking generated by religious doctrines and the social reality. The analysis allows to reveal the general basis of publicistic, artistic and philosophical texts, as well as to raise the question of possible convergence of social epistemology and Losev's doctrine of relative and absolute mythologies, the most consistently developed by the philosopher in his book The Dialectics of Myth.

AB The article is devoted to the initial period of establishing relations between the Kalmyks and the peoples of the North Caucasus in the middle of the 17th century, which at that time mainly had military and political nature. As a result of migration from Central Asia to the prairie lands of the Northern Caspian, not only the Nogai hordes on the Volga, Terek and Kuban were impacted by the Kalmyk cavalry, but also by other peoples of the North Caucasus, primarily Kabardians, who supported the Nogais and spoke on their side. Moscow used all political and military means against the Kalmyks transition to the right bank of the Volga and their appearance in the North Caucasus.
   Reflecting the first offense of the Kalmyks in 1644, Kabardian dynast could not finally stop the expansion of the Kalmyk rulers into their region as a result concluded an alliance with them.
   After the beginning of the Russo-Polish War of 1654-1667, Moscow state concluded a military alliance with the Kalmyks. This agreement was directed primarily against the Crimean Khanate, who took the side of the republic. The Kalmyk cavalry, already with the support of the tsarist government, again invades the North Caucasus to prevent the unification of the Crimean-Tatar and Kuban-Nogai cavalry and prevent them from joining the main military of the Russo-Polish war.
   The arrival of the Kalmyk people greatly changed the political alignment in the North Caucasus, and in the future was permanent of the Kalmyk people in the region during the 17th-18th centuries.

DT Book Review
DE Mongols; Turks; Tatars; nomadic peoples; Chinese sources; ethnonymy;

AB The present paper does not aim to be so much a review as a commentary on the 2015 book by Roman P. Khrapachevsky dedicated to the publication of translations of the fragments from Chinese sources of the 10th-14th centuries about the tribes known under the names of Tatar and Mongol. The book under review, in the opinion of the author of the paper, is a significant contribution to the study of the nomadic peoples of Inner Asia in Russian historiography and provides a very useful instrument for researchers who are not fluent in Chinese. Without touching on topic of the quality of translations given by Khrapachevsky, it could be noted that some research sections and references drew some comments. In particular, the author of the review considers uncertain some of linguistic identifications made by Khrapachevsky relating to the bearers of certain ethnonyms. This fact, accordingly, makes any following findings questionable. In addition, according to the author of the paper, the methodology for the reconstruction of non-Chinese words and names deserves a more fundamental justification as a whole. At the same time, as is pointed out, these aspects are too complicated in themselves and, in any case, would be of a debatable nature, something which makes this book of Khrapachevsky additionally important for their further development. The main observation about the book relates to its relatively scanty bibliographic apparatus, which, according to this reviewer, was reflected by the lack of depth of the book's commentary. In general, the book fulfilled its main task, providing Russian-speaking researchers, both historians and linguists, with new material for further studies of the history of Inner Asia.

   conditions; professional efficiency
AB The modern system of personnel management is aimed at enhancing the efficiency of each employee and therefore much attention is paid to the profiling of toxic managers, who negatively affect the environment and relationships at work. The analysis of the factors related to disorganized professional management have pinpointed weak motivation and disinterested performance as most important reasons for toxic behavior. This survey covered 60 mid- and top-level managers with 8-12 years' work experience. This study found the majority of these managers to be toxic. The following instruments, the 'Diagnostics of Disorganizing Factors in Personal Time Management'; 'Analysis of Personal Impediments'; 'Diagnostics of Self-Organization Features-39' (DSF-39) and motivational self-assessment profiles provided the data for the study. The findings show that the respondents' skills of goal-setting and goal-achievement were poorly developed. The majority struggled to set their goals and to choose optimal strategies for achieving them. Moreover, they faced difficulties in work organization, time management and planning. They found it hard to control their time and assess their own efficiency. The majority of our respondents can be described as toxic managers as they are unable to overcome internal and external difficulties and are reluctant to demonstrate determination or to control their negative emotional states.

AB The increasing spatial fluidity of the population in general and the inclusion of a wider range of people in international migration in particular is recognized as one of the most visible manifestations of globalization. However, processes contributing to the movement and global relations at the same time generate physical and socio-political immobility, alienation, and dissociation. The phenomenon of (im)mobility is considered from a political point of view. Making use of the institutional approach, the author defines (im) mobility as a process caused by international and national political institutions' activities, on one hand, and stimulating the emergence of formal and informal political practices, on the other hand. Government regulation of cross-border migration is reflected in the demands of the valid grounds for the legal entering the territory of a state, the development of distance forms of mobility management, the establishment of financial mechanisms, and the imposition of restrictive migration measures. The isolating practices of modernity meet up with postmodern digital practices. Herewith, political barriers prevent the movement of potentially dangerous individuals and groups, and those not representing a danger to the community, violating human rights and fundamental freedoms, which are so-called mobility rights. Initiatives performed by political parties and public associations prevent mobile citizens from accessing not only political leadership, but also their participation in political agenda setting.

AB The reviewed collective study "Cultural Complexity of Modern Nations" is devoted to the actual issues of nation and state building. These problems are considered within two frameworks of the world complexity: internal cultural identity diversity of the inhabitants of modern nation-states and plurality of country cultural patterns of these states at their different historical stages. Pluralism and multivariance of the modern world development have prompted the authors of this work to develop new conceptual approaches to the categorization of this world and to consider social processes within new analytical reference systems. Researchers are expanding the notion of diversity, making it even more versatile and accentuating its style difference component. Multiculturalism as a model of management of cultural differences in the "old" nations is presented in different guises - not only as a collapsed European integration project. This approach shows viability on the Australian continent. And according to Berlin example, many successes are on account of the successor of such policies, interculturalism, at the local level. The authors realize a fruitful "revision" of the used category of the nation, to which a plural meaning is attached. They demonstrate a transient nature, socio-political and regional specificity of this phenomenon, multiplicity of forms of nation and state formations. Hybrid, centaur-like type of new collectivities that emerged in the postcolonial period, is generated by their borrowing political institutions and norms of Western societies and the imposition of foreign models into inappropriate social and cultural environment. Pondering over the destiny of nations in the world, which is becoming postnational, the authors raise the possibility of the formation of post-national states. Probably one of the characteristics such social coalitions will be the abandonment of national sovereignty as the main attribute of the state in favor of trans-state institutions of governance. Their modern examples are transnational unions, cross-border religious communities as a kind of nation-community, created on the basis of faith.

AB Many of the modern comparative projects seek solutions to the problem of the "gap in explanation" in the "epistemological" Yogacara philosophy. M. Bitball in his comparison of phenomenological reduction and Buddhist meditation relies not on epistemology, but on ontology. He compares the "strategy of ontological deconstruction" with Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka. The author of the paper shows that, despite the promise of such an intellectual move for comparative studies, it is not sufficient. In order for the meeting of phenomenology and Buddhism could open the rich resources of Buddhist philosophy and "inner" science for the modern science of consciousness, it is necessary to have a more comprehensive picture of the nature, types and functions of meditation within the Madhyamaka.

AB The Internet has turned into a space of mass communication. The network resources successfully compete with the media in formats and outreach to the audience. The study of political processes in the Internet space, the analysis of participating parties, the volume and the quality of network communications, and the models of discourse give a new direction to the sociological research - the sociology of the Internet. The transformation of social practices in the modern world justifiably brings changes in the traditional mechanisms of socio-political interaction. Political communications, which are in vanguard of actualization, articulation and demonstration of the socio-political relations, are exposed to the innovative processes and have to adapt to new challenges. New quantitative and qualitative characteristics of political communications, used in the Internet space, should be assessed outside the rigid good versus bad categories. The dynamic transformations of modern organizational and communication technologies cannot receive any prompt yet clear public assessment, and many aspects of political discourse are still at the stage of formation. Thus, it is crucial to explore the possibilities of social networks, the communicating parties, and the forms of communication and evaluate the potential of regular citizens ( users) who are able to participate in the political discourse of the modern society.

AB Novel biotechnologies drastically enhance human capacities. However, initial optimism concerning new methods of therapy and body modification gradually gives way to fears that technologies can easily get out of hand and alter human nature in an undesirable way. Philosophers approach bioethical discussion from various assumptions and perspectives: while some of them believe that new technologies enhance and better human beings, others are concerned those technological innovations can be perilous. This paper overviews the discussion between utilitarians and bioconservatives on the extent to which human enhancement technologies should be permitted. I suggest an alternative communitarian approach to consider human beings primarily as members of political communities and recognition-seekers. I take the debate on doping legalization in sports to demonstrate how communitarianism doesn't reject new technologies and still argues for making them work for preservation and flourishing of human communities. All major decisions on regulating biotechnologies should be made by communities themselves in a democratic way and drawing on bioethical expertise.

AB The article considers the problem of delimitation of the Arctic maritime spaces at the close of the 19th century in the context of the Russian Empire, historical, political and legal factors that influenced the ambiguous and inconsistent policy of the Tsarist government in relation to island spaces having a direct historical and commercial connection with dozens of generations of the Russian Pomors.
   The role of fisheries and scientific research is substantiated as an ongoing policy of "effective occupation" in the Arctic Seas and archipelagoes. Spatial remoteness and total misunderstanding by the central authorities of the specifics of affairs in the Russian North led, ultimately, to a "policy of concessions" in relation to lands, as well as to the loss of geopolitical positions in the sea due to significant backwardness in technical equipment. The empire considered a certain benefit in the existence of "frontiers", since unstable borders predetermined a potentially beneficial territorial acquisition, "accretion", while its rigid fixation automatically served as a factor of self-restraint, which contradicted the very nature of the empire. The paper emphasizes the continuity of the process of scientific diplomacy, when science serves as one of the foundations of the territorial claims of states.

Kara-Murza has been developing unique genres of philosophic study, including philosophical travelology and a local study approach that lies at the junction of the philosophical investigation into the history of Russia and historical examination of local places. The method he is advancing could be called an intellectual topography of Russian history. This method of philosophical-historical research pioneered by Kara-Murza assumes an inquiry into the genesis of ideas, images, and artistic and historical associations that have been emerging as the cultural spaces of Russia and Europe meet and mingle: the semantic topoi of cultures that encourage thinkers and writers into creative and philosophical reflection.

TI LANGUAGE OF POLITICS OR LANGUAGE IN POLITICAL FUNCTION?
SO POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY
   OF POLITICS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE language; political function; speech acts; political communication;
   political reality
AB The article attempts to distinguish between the notions of "language of politics" and "language in political function". The "language of politics" is usually defined as language means used in political communication or for political purposes. The author suggests that "language in political function" would be a more appropriate term for such definition.
   Politics can be viewed as a communicative modus of human activity, in which language plays the role of an instrument or even an instrument of all political instruments. The growing influence of communicative and semantic factors upon the political processes entails an even greater increase in the importance of semiotic characteristics. However, the reverse perspective can also be true: interpreting politics as a special form of linguistic activity - accommodation of the world to words produced through the institutionalized speech acts. Performativity and autoreferentiality of institutional facts that constitute social ontology imply that under the guise of representing reality the text actually forms reality.
   The linguistic and semiotic characteristics of language in political function can be supplemented by communicative ones through introducing a political function into R. Jakobson's pattern of language functions. It can be interpreted as an inverted magical function, when "an absent or inanimate, "third person"" turns into not only an addressee, but also a sender of the message. In the process of the political communication, not only an addressee and an addresser, but also communication itself, are institutionalized. The real communication is formalized as its semiotic analogue. As in the case with the magic function of language, a speech act is assumed to lead to a change of the world, and the participants of this act are endowed with the appropriate power, but the source of this power is not mythology, but rather the social structure of society.

   interaction; confessional politics; legal foundations of confessional
   policy of Russian Federation; postsecularity
AB This paper is devoted to the study of the model of interaction between state authorities and religious organizations in modern Russia. Traditionally, it is believed that since the 1990s a separation model of religious and political interactions, which was set by the 1993 Constitution of the Russian Federation that proclaimed the secular nature of the state, has been implemented in the Russian Federation. However, today there are reasons to believe that the interaction between authorities and religious organizations is being transformed from state-confessional relations into the cooperative model in Russia. These changes are indicated by an attempt of the state to build partnership relations with religious organizations representing traditional confessions, by concluding cooperation agreements on their interaction in various spheres of public life. Despite the large number of agreements between the state and religious organizations, it must be recognized that they are "point-like", and their subject is cooperation of the parties in a particular sphere of public life. In the Russian Federation, there are no complex agreements (concordats) concluded between states and religious organizations. The current tendency to change the model of the religious-political interaction is not irreversible, since it is not fixed by any legal "steps". Moreover, a change of models has never been proclaimed by the state as the ultimate goal of changing the confessional policy. However, all the transformations concerning communicative strategies are not accidental; they reflect the changes that occur not only in the country, but also in the world, and they can be defined as the "return of religion to the public space". The desire of religious organizations to participate in all spheres of social life, including the political sphere, forces the state to seek new approaches to building state-confessional interactions, which, in the author's view, is not a consistent implementation of the state's strategy, but rather a forced reaction to the growing activity of religious organizations.

DE Plantinga; analytic philosophy; Christian philosophy; philosophy of

AB Alvin Plantinga played a pivotal role in bringing theological questions and ideas into the broad philosophical, predominantly non-theistic community. His "Advice to Christian Philosophers" (1983) was the turning point in the history of philosophical theology. In his "Advice", Plantinga talks about how best to be a Christian in philosophy. He suggests that Christian intellectuals should become more autonomous from the rest of the philosophical world, display more unity, and express greater Christian self-confidence. This advice, however, is addressed not to just any intellectual of a Christian affiliation. He addresses them to those (1) who have graduated from a conservative Christian college, (2) who have obtained a PhD in philosophy, and (3) who continue their career as professional philosophers. That means that the person should be well acquainted with the traditional Christian doctrine and practice, should be well versed in the contemporary analytic philosophy, and should be an acknowledged member of the established philosophical community. Thus, it would be a mistake to apply Plantinga's "Advice" to a person who does not meet all of the three requirements. The present day situation in Russia shows a dramatic shortfall of intellectuals who satisfy all the three Plantinga's conditions. It is still premature for Russian Christian philosophers to become autonomous from the rest of the philosophical community, to establish Christian philosophical clusters, and to display Christian self-confidence in the face of the non-theistic majority. Philosophical theology in Russia is currently in its "pre-Plantingan" phase. In order to improve this situation, the author suggests reversing Plantinga's advice into their opposites. Russian Christian philosophers ought to learn how to operate within the broad philosophical community. They should familiarize themselves with the contemporary analytic philosophy and its methods, and they should become acknowledged members of the established professional circles. Then, and only then, philosophical theology in Russia can enter its post-Plantingan era.

AB The paper is about social control practices over new religious movements (NRMs). Its first part describes the main trend in governmental judicial attempts in control over NRMs: from accusations in "brainwashing" to the "child abuse" allegations. The second part of the paper describes the factors we can find for explaining the evolution of judicial regulations on the NRM activities. Donald Black defines law as a social phenomenon, "governmental social control", which can be considered as a quantitative variable varying in its amount and type. William Chambliss introduces some sort of a conflict paradigm. James Richardson, combining both approaches, focuses on some key factors that influence the socio-legal control over NRMs. Firstly, following Chamliss, Richardson analyses key groups of interests, such as NRMs and anti-cult movements. He considers actors' characteristics including social distance between the victim and the offender and other points made by Black. Secondly, he analyses socio-cultural context as a platform for actors' interaction, speaking particularly about the "moral panic". Thirdly, Richardson focuses attention on such a crucial factor as characteristics of the legislative, executive and judicial powers, particularly, on the independence of the latter, and their historically shaped interaction in the local country. Fourthly, Richardson estimates the role of "third parties" (Black's concept) - groups that do not immediately take part in the conflict, but simultaneously support some side in the conflict. A special category of third parties in the situation around NRMs is academic researchers, who have been criticising the 'brainwashing ideology" for 40 years appearing as experts in courts. Fifthly, following Chambliss, Richardson considers "triggers" - outstanding events that reveal and enforce already existing social interaction networks.

DE ancient philosophy of language; history of logic; "Topics"; Aristotle;

AB In the paper, some problematic aspects of ancient linguistic conventionalism in the context of Aristotelian philosophy of language, developed in "Topics" and "On Interpretation", are considered. The dialectical (dialogic-eristic) principle of manipulating various etymological aspects of names (primary / present / suitable / literal) is analyzed within the framework of ancient theories of etymology. The paper substantiates the idea of certain functional closeness of ancient linguistic naturalism to conventionalism for the purposes of dialectical persuasion. Although linguistic naturalism is opposed to conventionalism as an alternative; nonetheless, conventionalism also recognizes the idea of semantic hierarchies of names in the context of primary/secondary, authentic/non-authentic, appropriate/inappropriate etymological entities for the purpose of didactics or discussion. Conventionalism and naturalism are functionally indistinguishable at the level of selection and use of etymologies. Moreover, for conventionalism, postulating the connection of a relevant etymon with an appropriate convention, the rejection of a conventionally established meaning of a word may have specific eristic value. In the paper, the etymological transformations of names proposed by Aristotle in "Topics" 112a are explored by means of Stephen Toulmin's minimal argumentative model. Aristotle's argument can be treated as a sophistic legerdemain: if the opponent alters the semantics of the proponent's argument (data), the basis of argumentation (warrant) becomes irrelevant and, consequently, the thesis becomes unsupported. The paper aims to raise research interest in ancient logic and philosophy of language.

ID SCIENCE
AB Nowadays, security issues are critically burning for the world community, the State and society as well as for an individual. Practical activities of states and other structures which ensure national security in general and its certain types in particular must be based on a comprehensive scientific study of such category as "national security" primarily from the philosopho-legal point of view. This is particularly reflected in the development of the science of security (SoS). This article presents a comprehensive fundamental philosopho-legal study of the national security system. The category "national security" is multidimensional and includes such types as state security, public security, personal security, information security, environmental security, transport security and others. In the article there is an attempt to reconsider the category of "national security" from the point of view of a systematic approach to the analysis of the basis of differentiation of certain types in its system. The study is aimed at understanding the essence, nature and characteristics of national security. The results of this study can be used in public administration and legal confirmation of political decisions. The author comes to the conclusion that it is possible to distinguish national security into types in terms of 1 - a security object (interest to be protected) which therefore is divided into "social" (primary) and "non-social" (secondary) and in terms of 2 - a source of a threat.

DE academic capitalism; entrepreneurship; academic practice; profiles of
   academic habitus
AB The reasons for the formation and spread of the practice of academic capitalism are considered. It is argued that the commercialization of the academic sphere is not only the effect of the spread of neoliberalism, but also the result of the activities of the academic community itself. The author asks the questions of which understanding of entrepreneurship underlies today's practice of academic capitalism, how it is realized, which common and different features the academic sphere and business have. It is shown that entrepreneurship is a product of agent-subject determination; it is represented by a variety of forms, which creates uncertainty in the use of this term in the academic practice analysis and the impossibility of its reducing entirely to the economic aspect. The forms of entrepreneurship in the academic sphere such as academic, research and educational are identified. It is stated that the formation and spread of the practice of academic capitalism is accompanied by a variety of behavioral models of academic community representatives. The author introduces the notion of profiles of the academic habitus represented by a set of typical forms of activity that characterize the modern practice of academic capitalism and form the dynamic framework depending on institutional structures and personal dispositions. As evidence, the author refers to the results of empirical studies, according to which the academic community is exposed to diversification and it is multilayered. It is concluded that interaction between the economy and the academic sphere is asymmetric. The reduction of government spending, the disposal of different types of academic activities and the formation of the "market" profile of the academic habitus make it necessary to preserve the academic sphere as an organization whose entrepreneurship consists in the universalization of knowledge as a public good.

AB In the paper, the author analyses the recent publications in journals Sociological Research, Sociological Journal, Sociology of Science and Technology (2015-2018), dealing with the institutional and social peculiarities of the functioning of science. These include methods for measuring the effectiveness of scientific activities, the problem of human capacities, scientific migration and management of science. The review shows the concern of experts on the spiritual, social and material status of the scientific community, the low level of protection of young scientists. The peculiarities of the functioning of science in modern Russia are determined by poor relations with business, lack of applied research. In this context, Russian science is still not adequately focused on civilian innovations, their search and promotion. For a long time, nobody has studied Russian science as a social institution, and this essentially affected its management, design and development. Yet given the context, facts and findings in the analysed articles, the capacities of science in Russia remain high. The gradually developing sociological discourse deals with the problems of science in modern society, the perception of foreign experience and effective application, which allows to hope for overcoming the obstacles that were previously created by incompetent management.

DE Russia; Dagestan; religion; religious organizations; Protestants
AB The aim of the article is to show the intensity of the development of the religious component of the Dagestan society by example of evangelical missions of Western preachers against the backdrop of the analysis of the socio-economic and socio-political development of the republic in the first post-perestroika decade. The authors proposed the following objectives to reach the aim: to determine the changes in the legislative basis of the post-perestroika time which served to promote the democratization of all spheres of society, including religious; to analyze the processes that took place in the socio-economic and socio-political life of the republic which caused a complex psychological resonance in the society and created a favorable ground for the "Evangelization" of the Dagestan peoples. The methodological basis includes the principles of an interdisciplinary historical sociological research approach, the systematization and comparative analysis of information, historical impartiality. Documents from the Central State Archive of the Republic of Dagestan, field material collected during personal visits to the religious communities examined in the study, as well as a sociological survey among the population of the republic carried out within the RFBR research project by a group of scholars including the authors of this publication, were used as materials for the study. The authors came to the following conclusions in the course of research. One of the most striking manifestations of the religious component of the country, including Dagestan, after the collapse of the Soviet Union against the backdrop of the socio-economic and political depression that developed in the country was the active growth and activities of Protestant organizations, including the emergence of new charismatic non-traditional churches. The activities of Protestants in the national republics, in particular Dagestan, became a very difficult psychological factor for Dagestan, mainly Muslim, society. Migration processes associated with the outflow of the Russian population from the republic had a negative impact on the ethnic component of the new communities in the republic. This is shown by a retrospective survey among the residents of the republic, which confirms that among the changes that took place in the republic in the considered period the "moral component of society" (55.2%), the "state of the economy as a whole" (49.8%), the "living standard" (51.8%) were worsening. The crisis in society provoked the "influx" of Western missionaries with the purpose of creating sustainable communities here. Visits of the missionaries were manifested in various forms. On the one hand, "exchange activities" (visiting the leaders of their brothers and sisters in other countries) from the local Protestant communities were organized. However, there were also missionaries who, having arrived in the mountainous areas and settled with their families in the mountains of Dagestan, "unobtrusively", relying on the Bible postulates of faith "in love that comes from God and rules the world, and God commanded compassion for those in need", tried to "build international bridges of friendship".

DE legal philosophy; positivism; idealism; inevitableness of philosophy
AB Legal philosophy is a disputed subject. Not only is the concept itself much discussed, but also the field it deals with. After the heydays of legal philosophy in the aftermath of idealist thinking when Kant, Fichte and Hegel developed their own versions of it, legal philosophy had a difficult stand. Many legal positivists tried to avoid it and instead coined the concept of legal theory. Thereby they wanted to avoid speculative arguments as well as the engagement with moral questions and tried to develop a scientific study of law. However, already the question whether there is a subject of legal philosophy engages in a philosophical debate and shows its inevitability. Fundamental questions about the nature of law and the status of its properties would remain unanswered, if lawyers as well as philosophers ceased to engage in it. Even speculative theories about the nature of law could turn out to be true for different arguments than the ones with which they were introduced so that it is not sufficient to criticize the speculative character of their theses. Instead one needs to discuss their merits in a philosophical debate. Answers to philosophical questions can be searched for from above, i.e. by applying general philosophical theories to law. This approach is typically taken by philosophers who are not familiar with a particular legal system. Contrary to that is an approach from below that starts from single legal norms as well as problems and looks for philosophical arguments to answer its questions. For this purpose the philosophical dimension of the current law is investigated. This is the typical approach of lawyers. Both approaches do not necessarily lead to the same questions, as not all philosophical questions are relevant for every legal system. The knowledge of a particular legal system is necessary in order to find the philosophical questions that are most relevant for it. However, the arguments remain independent of such a system and are thus philosophical in kind.

AB The article discusses the formation of the image of the Czechoslovakian Legion within the framework of symbolic and commemorative practices carried out by the Provisional Siberian and Provisional All-Russian governments in the summer of 1918 - the autumn of 1918. The image of the Czechoslovak legionnaires was built into the narrative of the "revival of Russia", which was considered a key element of anti-Bolshevik ideology. The image was formed in the official representation of the state power through the implementation of various celebrations, rituals, commemorations, and demonstration of certain symbols. Following R.S. Wortman, the authors analyse the representations of the Czechoslovakian Legionnaires within the practices that were part of the "scenarios of power" of anti-Bolshevik governments in Siberia in the summer of 1918 - the autumn of 1919. Czechoslovakian Legionnaires were permanent and integral participants of the military festivities, official receptions and celebrations, banquets and mourning events held in Siberia during the period under analysis. Having a a special symbolic status within the "scenarios of power" of the anti-Bolshevik governments, these events were to create a positive images of a strong state power and its allies, including Czechoslovaks. The motive of the all-Slavic unity was the key one. The idea of "brotherhood in arms" between Russians and Czechs was expressed through joint military ceremonies and in the images of heroes who "died for the Slavdom" in the process of solemn funeral and installation of monuments at the burial places of the Czechs and Slovaks victims. The authors conclude hat symbolic and commemorative practices in which the Czechoslovak Corps was involved were used by the political propaganda of the anti-Bolshevik governments in Eastern Russia and by the loyal press to create the image of "brothers in blood" as a collective Hero-Saviour, a source of legitimacy of the new state power in Siberia, a mediator for the restoration of relations with former allies in the First World War and other Slavic nations.

ID CONSCIOUSNESS
AB The main two-level theories of consciousness are metarepresentationism and self-representationism. According to metarepresentationism, conscious states are conscious in virtue of being targeted by suitable higher-order representations. According to self-representationism, phenomenal consciousness is injected into the world when subject's internal states acquire the capacity to represent themselves. So the disagreement is over the question whether it is possible to experience something without being peripherally aware of experiencing it or not. Examining the relationship between these two opposing trends may occur instructive, because it suggests that the sense of a mental state being conscious that self-representationists have fixed on may not be the same that most others have in mind. The author of the paper defends here the view that intentionality is explanatorily prior to consciousness. The primary aim of this paper is to show that while the way the self-representationalist approach captures the fundamental facts about the phenomenon of permanent implicit self-awareness gives it prima facie phenomenological adequacy, there is no ultimate phenomenological evidence in favor of self-representationalism. The author's argument rests on a straightforward observation that there are two types of qualities which self-representationalists fail to distinguish. We must make a distinction between first-order perceptual qualia and second-order "what it is like" to experience these qualia. The second type requires awareness and so is something distinct from the quality itself. When we are careful to draw this distinction, the assumption that qualia are irreducible appears unjustified: first-order qualia are fully reducible to representational content, and second-order qualia can be defined in functional terms. The argument proceeds as follows. The author elucidates the irreducibility thesis and cases that support it. Further he argues that Galen Strawson's case for cognitive phenomenology and Searle's arguments do not extend to unconscious intentionality. The author closes with some considerations making metarepresentationism preferable to self-representationism.

AB The concept of knowledge used in the computer science unlike the one widely used in today's philosophical epistemology (knowledge as justified true belief) does not involve the requirement according to which knowledge has to be justified. The neglect of this issue in the computer science originates from the philosophical logic of the 20th century where for various historical and conceptual reasons the concept of justification has been left out of the mainstream and as a consequence remained without a proper formal treatment. This situation has perceivable negative outcomes in the existing knowledge representation technologies, which makes a certain thinker become skeptical about the capacities of such technologies to convey truths or even about the truth concept itself. Recent research in the fields of proof-theoretic semantics, homotopy type theory and formal epistemology help us to outline a theoretical background for solving this problem.

DE Ramsey; Russell; paradox; logic; mathematics; language; set; class;
   statement; proposition; classification
AB The problem of paradoxes is discussed in this paper. At the beginning of the 20th century the problem was presented by Bertrand Russell and Frank Ramsey. Russell thought all paradoxes as similar to each other. Ramsey asserted that they are divided into two completely different groups. The paradoxes of group A are logical paradoxes. The paradoxes of group B are semantic (linguistic) paradoxes. The paradoxes of group A are connected with problems of some logical and mathematical concepts. The paradoxes of group B are connected with problems of linguistic expression of concepts. In the second half of the 20th century Ramsey's point of view was dominant. The modem Australian logician Graham Priest affirms that Russell was right and Ramsey was wrong for all paradoxes have a common structure and one way to solve them. The authors of this paper assert that it is a difficult task to distinguish paradoxes on Ramsey's basis because there are so-called "frontier paradoxes". These paradoxes can be interpreted to be logical as well as semantic paradoxes. But it does not mean that Ramsey was wrong at all. The authors think that Priest's assessment of Ramsey's classification of paradoxes is incorrect. Ramsey's classification is meaningful but it should be corrected. As a conclusion, the authors offer the project of a new classification of paradoxes. Ramsey's classification may be retained but it would be supplemented. The classification should consist of three groups of paradoxes: A (pure logical paradoxes), B (pure linguistic paradoxes) and C (frontier paradoxes).

AB In today's Russia, questions about national identity, nation-building, and nationwide integration are among the most discussed issues at the highest possible political levels. The issues become more acute in borderland regions, where more trans-border movement creates an environment for double or multiple cultural identities and diffuse representations about "ownness" and "otherness". Sociological surveys conducted in four regions of Russia (the Altai region, the Amur region, the Republic of Karelia, and the Jewish Autonomous Region, n=400) explored national identification, structuring ethnic diversity in Russia, and giving grounds for generalizations and stereotypes from the data collected with repertory grids and using hierarchical cluster analysis, PCA, Proctrustes analysis, and psychosemantic space building. Main results included elaboration of the original research tool, tested in the Russian borderland, description of Russians as they are perceived by borderland inhabitants, their relations with meta-ethnic groups associated with the Russian nation, and latent factors, influencing the assessment of people of different nationalities.

   communities
AB The decision-making process is characterized by a high degree of conflict between actors, each of which has its own portfolio of projects and proposals for overcoming the already actualized problems. Promotion of ideas in the agenda of public administration becomes possible through the efforts of network coalitions, whose success depends on the collective efforts of participants in managing network interaction, rather than of isolated actors. The political positions of a coalition can be weakened or strengthened by the action of external factors that are not controlled by it. Among these factors are changes in public expectations, deterioration of the economic situation, social structures operating in the political system and legislative restrictions. The success of a political coalition also depends on the promotion of new ideas, but they should be supported by the expert community and thus will have high chances of implementation in the practice of public administration. Bearers and translators of new ideas in the political and administrative system are epistemic communities - networks that unite professionals who claim to prioritize their expertise in a particular problem area. Epistemic communities are formed around specific problems that are becoming relevant in shaping the agenda. Their exceptional importance lies in the ability to create knowledge about the problem or a group of problems of interest to the decision maker. A typical example of epistemic communities is "think tanks" - research laboratories that create an intellectual product in various areas of public policy, which is the basis for making strategic decisions. The role of epistemic communities in the framing of the problem is due to two factors: the degree of uncertainty of the problem and the scale of the expert market. Combinations of these factors show the following possible roles: mediator, agent, advisor, shadow consultant. The influence of epistemic communities is explained by the following reasons: possession of up-to-day knowledge, ideological neutrality, non-participation in political competition.

AB The Civil War in Russia posed an important problem for the fighting sides to find allies and consolidate political, diplomatic, and military in solving internal and geopolitical tasks. As heads of governments, Admiral Kolchak and General Denikin saw the interaction with newly formed Slavic states - Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia - as a special factor in these processes. Official documents indicate their aspiration to retain Russia's leading role in the life of the Slavs to strengthen their international position in deciding their own fate at the Paris Peace Conference. The White Army governments sought to consolidate the Slavs, who shared cultural identity, the system of values and military and political attitudes in their struggle against "Germanism and Bolshevism". Kolchak and Denikin, as well as some representatives of socio-political organisations, considered Serbs, Croatians, Slovenians, and Carpatho-Rusins as particularly congenial in terms of "their inclinations and general interests" among all other Slavic peoples. The anti-Soviet governments believed that the memory of Russia's fighting for Slavs' freedom had resulted in their loyalty to Russia and readiness to defend it. Thus, these governments supported the formation of military units consisting of Yugoslav prisoners of war (approximately 200,000 people in Russia) to fight against the Soviet power and also funded Southern Slavs' organisations. They established diplomatic relations with Serbia and the Yugoslav government. In the new conditions, the White Guards failed, however, to achieve a desired unity among Yugoslavs to protect Russian interests.

DE culture; dialogue; global; local; postcolonial studies
AB Postcolonial studies transform the theory of the dialogue of cultures in the philosophy of culture. The key concepts formulated by Mikhail Bakhtin and Vladimir Bibler (understanding the Other, being on the border of culture, polyphony, ambivalence) acquire a new reading. The understanding of the dialogue of cultures as the interaction of equivalent cultures is rejected. The emergence of postcolonial discourse in social and humanitarian sciences is associated with the fixation of the illusion of an equal dialogue. In postcolonial studies, the emphasis is shifted to peripheral practices of upholding the independence and identity of oppressed cultures; the existence of dominance and subordination in the communication is emphasized. Bakhtin and Bibler formulated a thesis that, in the dialogue, the logic of culture is formed and the culture realizes its own uniqueness. In postcolonial studies, this thesis is strengthened. It is recognized that culture needs to defend the right to its discourse. In postcolonial studies, the border of cultures as a space of cultural creativity is interpreted as a borderland where hybrid cultures are formed. To analyze the simultaneous existence of multiple discourses in the narrative of a hybrid culture, the author uses the concept of a polyphonic culture proposed by Bakhtin. The border of cultures is not only their division, but also the space of their intersection. A hybrid culture bears the imprint of cultures on the edges of which it was formed. A hybrid culture is a symbiosis of other people's meanings. The concept of hybrid culture allows not only to describe the special status of a culture that arose in the situation of a dialogue, but also to fix its ambivalent and polydiscursive character. The narration of a hybrid culture about one's self demonstrates the ambivalent mutual negation and mutual conditioning of a minimum of two discourses. The popularity of postcolonial discourse in social and humanitarian sciences leads to an extensive application of postcolonial methodology. Traces of imperial discourse, domination and subordination begins are searched for beyond colonial practices.

AB Quite often in the philosophy of mind, individual arguments (in support or refutation of physicalism, functionalism, epiphenomenalism and various versions of dualism) are reproduced outside the historical context and without considering the linguistic turn, as if there was no linguistic turn. While explicating the logical possibility of a zombie, David Chalmers only mentions the book by the Australian philosopher Keith Campbell and the famous article by Robert Kirk (today Kirk continues to work closely on the philosophical zombie) in the commentaries. Usually, the formulation of any argument does not require (within the framework of a conceptual discussion) a return to the historical context. But some ways of thinking after the linguistic turn almost completely disavow the discussion of the logical (or metaphysical) possibility of zombies (and the discussion of an argument directly), and the discussion of other arguments. In this paper, some arguments from the philosophy of mind and the corresponding thought experiments are considered in the context of the philosophy of the late Ludwig Wittgenstein. Attention is paid to the argument of knowledge and the mental experiment "Mary's room" in the presentation of John Perry.

DE Orthodoxy; culture; sacred; secular; property
AB The main theme of the paper is the definition of the boundaries of the concept "Slavic world" on the example of its specified sample, the "Russian world", in the context of the essential idea that binds this world, that allows people living in this world, regardless of their geographical location in the coordinate system of the globe, to understand each other. That is, people can be on the same not only geographical, but also hermeneutic surface, within a single territory of conscious meanings; they can have shared meanings, social and cultural codes, though not always conscious. Moreover, they can speak about their common social, civil, political, cultural and ideological similarity as "Russian", regardless of nationality. Paraphrasing the words of Kant, we can say: the most valuable thing is to realize that it is us and that we think identically. The thesis of the paper is that culture, which indicates the appearance of a people, is determined by faith. A change of faith results in the disappearance of a people. In other words, social groups, communities, strata, peoples of the state will unite around certain values - even if first secular, they will necessarily become sacred; or first sacred and immediately recognized in their primevalness. At the same time, the way people behave in the presence of their sacred values testifies to their economic and social relations, everyday behavior, gestures, facial expressions, customs, traditions, habits, customs, laws, or, more specifically, to rituals, conscious or not yet conscious. In the first case, we can only speak about civilizational processes; in the second about cultural and civilizational ones. It is in the second case that we can speak about symbols, myths, legends, chronicles, epics, folklore, ideologies, and even about science, philosophy, political science and, particularly, sociology. In this regard, the representative basis of the research is the considered role of monastic life in the culture of Russia, namely, a study of the current problem of property and the attitude of the Church to it within the framework of the controversy between "possessors" and "non-possessors".

DE technoscience; humanitarian expert examination; methodology
AB In this paper, the author proposes a set of methodological approaches to the study of technoscientific projects. Their application allows to overcome two main shortcomings of modern science and technology studies (STS): (1) orientation only on the description of existing practices; (2) reduction of objects to their interactions. Humanitarian expert examination is a variant of overcoming of the first STS deficiency, as it implies a 'forward reaction' to the risks associated with the development of a specific technology. Simultaneously, the methodology of humanitarian expert examination includes the most dynamically developing approaches of the STS program: the study of social expectations and "sociotechnical imaginaries", the development of new approaches to expert practices. At the same time, the necessity to predict the socio-humanitarian effects of a technoscientific project assumes the creation of models of such development. The structure of epistemic networks and network models of innovation diffusion are considered as methodological variants of modeling, not so widely known yet in the Russian tradition of STS. In the framework of the humanitarian expert examination of a significant technoscientific project, a comparison of the structures of epistemic networks and networks models of innovation diffusion allows us to specify the class of strategies within which the adequacy of knowledge about the possibilities of technology can be sacrificed for the effectiveness of its dissemination. The implementation of these network models can overcome the first of the above-mentioned shortcomings of the STS program, but it is not free from the second one. Reduction of the social object to its interactions, in particular, does not allow to solve the problem of time lag between the development of innovation and its application. This problem is central for a number of areas of technoscience, for example, for translational medicine. In the framework of overcoming the second of the indicated shortcomings, the structure of network models should be supplemented by a more local and detailed consideration of the ontology of social objects and the discursive games occurring within the framework of their interaction. Ontological problems can be dealt with both within the concept of formation of group intentions elaborated by John Searle and within Gilbert Harman's object-oriented ontology. The conceptual apparatus for investigating discursive games is most fully described in Robert Brandom' s Making It Explicit.

TI INTERDISCIPLINARITY AND EXPERT KNOWLEDGE: A CASE OF "LAW AND ECONOMICS"

   JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY SOCIOLOGY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE

DT Article
DE interdisciplinarity; expert knowledge; law and economics; social
   epistemology; methodological imperialism; politics
AB The author discusses some aspects of interdisciplinary cooperation between law and economics. She argues that this cooperation has its own social purpose to develop an expert knowledge which is to be used as a source for political reforming. The author claims that interdisciplinarity in social sciences should be considered as an essential condition for the development of this sort of knowledge. She analyzes some epistemological issues of interdisciplinary collaboration in law and economics, namely, whether it should be considered as a bilateral dialogue or as an attempt of methodological invasion of economics into the field of law. In this respect, the author discusses some arguments provided by the supporters of so-called "methodological ecumenism" and "methodological imperialism". She argues that the expansion of the domain of economics should be understood as an attempt to create a unified social ontology. In this respect, she discusses the ideas of Gary Becker and Jack Hirschleifer who advocated the principle that "the social universe is written in the language of economics". The author also considers the arguments by Richard Posner in support of a bilateral dialogue between economics and law. It is shown that Posner aimed to find epistemological links between "law and economics" and legal positivism. These links were supposed to prove the unconventional idea that cooperation with economics corresponds to the principles of legal positivism (namely, with the "pure theory of law" by Hans Kelsen). The author shows that Posner's idea is built upon a misunderstanding of "pure theory", particularly, of the strict separation of sociology of law and "pure theory". That is why the author assumes that Posner provided his arguments only for political (not epistemological) purpose (for "law and economics" legitimization). Despite the regular theoretical debates on the foundations of "law and economics", this direction has already succeeded in the domain of expert knowledge. The author discusses two cases devoted to the problems of opiate and transplantation market regulation. The author considers these cases within the frame of expert knowledge which is to be used as a basis for political decisions. The author considers the specifics of expert knowledge in accordance with the ideas of Harry Collins and Robert Evans. She claims that expert knowledge in social sciences tends to be used as a guide for political reform - that is why it is supposed to be free from some relevant epistemological restrictions. In this respect, it seems to be reasonable to consider the issues of interdisciplinary cooperation in correspondence with the issues of expert knowledge.

DE museology; museum science; historiography; historiography of museums in
   Novosibirsk
AB Referring to the historiography of the museum of Novosibirsk it should be noted that a comprehensive study of this issue was not conducted. The period of the study covers the period from the 1920s. until now. A.M. Razgon was the first to write about the need to study the historiography of the museum work in the 1960s. In subsequent years, special articles by P. Ya. Bukshpan, G.I. Vedernikova were published. Against the background of the growing popularity of studying museum historiography, a large contribution to the study of museology in Russia and Western Siberia was made by Tomsk researchers N.M. Dmitrienko, L.A. Lozovaya, M.A. Butenko, V.S. Gluhov. Museum staff, local historians and members of the Society carried out the first museum studies of Novosibirsk for the Study of the Productive Forces of Siberia. Valuable information about the local history and museum activities of Novosibirsk is contained in the publications of the journal "Life of Siberia" in the section " Chronicle of Local History". In connection with the current political situation in the second half of the 1920s, the articles were subordinated to socialist construction. One of the most active figures of the museum and local lore movement in Siberia of the 1920s and 1930s. is G.I. Cheremnyh. His works contain the history of scientific organizations, showing the importance of museums in the studies of Siberia. In collaboration with N.K. Auerbach, G.I. Cheremnykh published a large article " The State of the Museum in the Siberian Territory". A detailed analysis of the activities of the Siberian museums of 1920-1926, which covers all areas of the museum work, allows us to compare and see the actual situation of the museum of Novosibirsk. Statesman A.V. Lunacharsky in his book "Month in Siberia" gave a positive review about the Novosibirsk Museum. In the early 1930s. G.I. Cheremnykh in the Siberian Soviet Encyclopedia was forced to write about the need for all museums to become the basis for cultural and social construction. During the recession, historiography of museums publishes brief articles about exhibitions, about the organization of the Siberian export department in the Novosibirsk Regional Museum and about the creation of a schoolroom at the museum.
   Since the 1960s. there is a revival of museum studies, including in historiography. L.I. Bozhenko covers the museum work of Novosibirsk in articles, in the works of V.L. Soskin. Omsk Professor N.A. Tomilov dedicates a number of articles to the Novosibirsk Museum, where he offers periodization of the history of the Novosibirsk Local History Museum. In 1995 and 2005, the Novosibirsk Regional Museum of Local History is publishing collections of articles for its anniversaries. In these collections, the main directions of museum activities are highlighted, articles by I.V. Salnikova and N.V. Melikhova with little-known facts about the history of the Novosibirsk Museum. O.N. Shelegina and E.I. Krasilnikova published monographs containing information about the museums of Siberia.
   The presented works allow to compare the museum work of Novosibirsk with other museums of Siberia, but at the same time it requires more careful study and detail in studying the history of museums of the city.

AB The main components of Karl Marx's doctrine are considered: the dialectical method, the concept of the materialist philosophy of history, and political-economic ideas. Class theory is reconstructed and analyzed. The author interprets Marxism as a philosophy of science, along with neo-Kantianism and positivism, which were dominant in the late 19th century, and shows the role of Marx in the development of the historical approach and the significance of his works for the establishment of subsequent methodological approaches in social sciences and the humanities, particularly for systemic and theoretical activity-oriented studies. The fate of Marx's ideas after his death is described in brief.

France has become a genuine political leader of the EU. The unification of Germany and the extension of the EU to the East as well as economic difficulties brought the French leadership in Europe into question, but at the same time, it did not reduce the ambitions of Paris. Macron's "European project" is seen as another strong impetus for further development of the EU and as an initiative that can restore the French leadership in the EU.

DE extradition; extradition of a criminal; international agreements;
   history of development; crime; transnational crime
AB Crime problems have long gone beyond national borders posing a threat not only to individual states but also to the society as a whole. These problems become especially relevant in the process of globalization, integration and unification of economic, political and cultural space. At the same time, the legal cooperation of states in criminal cases and, in particular, in extradition (extradition of criminals) is not efficient enough.
   The discussion and problematic nature of individual issues of extradition in the legal literature, abundance of legal acts that do not solve problems uniformly, absence of clear methods for international cooperation of states in extradition lead to the need to return to the origins of the establishment of the above-mentioned institution and the development of efficient standards that will enable it to provide the necessary assistance in fight against international crimes.
   The subject of the research is the international legal statutory instruments related to the extradition institution in terms of legal assistance of one state to another and fighting with the crime at the international level.
   The works of the following Russian authors has been devoted to the study of the extradition institute: A.S. Grishin, S.Sh. Daubasov, A.V. Plotnikov, N.A. Safarov, O.E. Simeon; as well as foreign: M.Sh. Bassiouni, I.A. Shearer, G. Gilbert, L. Gardocki, Sh.A. Williams.
   The purpose of this work is to study the phenomenon of extradition in modern criminal law through the prism of history, revealing its current state and inherent problems.
   Research tasks: to reveal the problems that accompanied the institution of extradition in the past; to assess the development of the extradition institute in the modern world; to study the problems that slow the development of the extradition institute; and to consider possible methods for their solution.
   As to methodology, historical, institutional, and complex approaches were used. Research methods: historical and legal, comparative and legal, logical and legal, extrapolation.
   The results of the study can fill gaps and neutralize the inaccuracies of the extradition institution, which are often complicated by interference of the political factor, relations of states on the world arena, which has a huge impact on the extradition process.

AB Ethnopolitical Studies is one of the most dynamically developing fields of political science, its importance and necessity for world development is hard to overestimate. The Russian tradition of ethnopolitical studies is well developed and widely recognized despite its young age. A new seminal work in this area has just appeared. The article is dedicated to the book "Ethnopolitical Dynamics of European Union" written by Alexander Tevdoy-Burmuli (published by Aspect Press in 2018). This is a textbook of the enlarged group of study fields 41.00.00 "Political Science and Regional Studies". It consists of a theoretical chapter and a few parts structured according to spatial (Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe) and scope (sub-national, national and supra-national nationalisms) principles. Largely this is a constructivist work; the author presents his views on ethnopolitical interactions in Europe, using a number of original explanatory and analytical theories. He also dwells on the peculiarities of ethnopolitical governance and subject-object relations in the ethnic field. The author places his work in the broader context of global ethnopolitical studies, referring to recent research conducted by leading European and American analysts. In the situation of present "conceptual quagmire" in the field of ethnopolitical studies, according to academician Valery Tishkov, the publication of this book is of significant importance for expert and educational community.

DE social democracy; democratic socialism; New Labour; Third Way; Neue

AB The article is devoted to the main tendencies of the evolution of European social democracy in the 21st century. By the end of the 20th century, social democracy dealt with haul problems caused by social, economic, socio-psychological changes in the Western countries, dysfunctions of the "welfare state" and the crisis of Keynesian socio-economic model in the era of globalization. The market-oriented modernization of social democracy became a response to the challenges. The processes of ideological renovation actively developed in the British Labour Party (BLP) and the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). Pro-market New Labour in Great Britain and supporters of "Neue Mitte" (The New Middle) in the German social democracy drew the principles of these parties nearer to social liberalism. Many other social democratic parties also adopted some elements of neo-liberal economics. However, the global financial crisis of 2008 stopped the shift of social democracy to the right. After 2008, social democracy began to return to more traditional agenda. Now European social democrats oppose neo-liberal "predatory" capitalism, defend the "welfare state" and social market economy, struggle against austerity. They criticize financial speculations and defend the regulation of financial markets, development of real sector and industrial policy. The BLP renounced promarket and pro-globalist doctrine of the New Labour, while the SPD placed social justice at the centre of its political philosophy. The author comes to a conclusion that European social democracy cannot renounce fully the vision of a new, post-capitalist society. The refusal from the vision can lead to intro party crises and the success of such left-wing socialists like Jeremy Corbyn and Benoit Hamon. On the other hand, imperative demands of globalization and the "new economy" will push social democrats to move to the centre of the political spectrum. The electoral success of social democratic parties will depend on whether they will be able to solve this dilemma. In the author's view, an important challenge for European social democracy is also a problem of migration regulation and integration of immigrants from the Third World into the Western society.

AB More than a half century ago, an outstanding English historian and political thinker Arnold Joseph Toynbee visualizing the future wrote that the previous world of separate and territorially limited civilizations would be gradually transformed into the world of plural, huge and universal diasporas of derent ethnic, religious, cultural backgrounds. The growth and expansion of present-day migrations is one of decisive features of the Global World structure and dynamics. As an outcome of wars, hungers, ecological catastrophes, ethnical and religious conflicts, predominance of local dictatorships, etc., millions and millions of human beings willy-nilly have to forsake their native birthplaces in search of favorable existence conditions. These massive processes drastically modify the whole picture of universal social, political and cultural history. The former world of relatively isolated civilizations seems to be almost finished; old European notions of tolerance and civil society need some kind of reconsideration; Oriental or Semi-Oriental clan structures are intensively "exported" to the countries of the West as well as to the Slavic area. This complex of circumstances provokes new challenges of xenophobia and mass right wing populism. All old notions of homogenous nation-state as well as those of "multiculturalism" seem to be obsolete. Thus, one of important imperatives of the present-day diasporized world seems to be connected with the search for new forms of cultural and political thinking based on renovated philosophical and political outlook.

AB With the start of international detente, the USSR searched for commercial partners in the Western bloc with the aim of adopting the most advanced technologies and influencing their foreign policies. Italy was one of the object of the Kremlin's attention. Through the ENI company, at the end of the 60s, Moscow and Rome launched their commercial relations which, in a few years time, led to the signing of two historical agreements on the supply of oil to Italy and on the construction of pipeline to bring gas from the Soviet Union to Italy. The Italian political class, while respecting international commitments, managed to elaborate bold political decisions to achieve its goals.

DT Article
DE Middle East; transformation; social changes; interfaith relations;
   religious identity; tradition; confessionalism; sectarianism
AB The main conclusion made by the author after analyzing changes in various areas of life in modern Middle Eastern states is that transformations in the Middle East are associated with interfaith relations but are not solely caused by them and are not necessarily a result of their deterioration. At present these changes can still be reversed but they may become irreversible in some aspects as a result of current trends. Universalization is the main trend that affects social relations in the region. It manifests itself both in the life of religious communities and in sociopolitical and economic regional contexts. There are shifts in the perception of the social role of religion and how religious relations are refracted in the political sphere. There is a discussion of the close connection between the religious self-perception of community members, on the one hand, and the form and nature of their participation in political processes, on the other. As a result, ideas of eliminating elements of political confessionalism (religion-based quotas in particular) are developing in a number of countries in the region. The author shows that changes in the religious picture of the world and self-perception of members of faith communities can be facilitated by both external and internal factors. The analysis of both groups of factors reveals their negative implications, such as the violation of the harmony of social relations and increase in various forms of social disintegration. These findings shed light on the deep level of socioeconomic and political-military crises that are destabilizing the situation in the Middle East region.

AB The article deals with issues of everyday life of Adygs (Circassians) under conditions of a protracted military conflict during the Caucasian war in the first half of 19th century. Based on the recollections of eyewitnesses and direct participants in the events (Russian military officers and foreign observers), literary works of local authors and folklore sources, authors of the study explore a human factor in the history of the Caucasian War, in terms of emotions, dramatic experiences, fears, and transformation of ethnic consciousness. In this regard, histories of everyday life, gender history, and history of mentality appear to be the most productive research methods and approaches. Using related research tools allowed analyzing an inner perception of death of Adygs in the violent conflict. Adygs appear in the study not as a faceless side of the conflict, but as an active and personalized historical subject.
   The Caucasian war was not only a chain of political and war events, but was full of personal stories, tragedies of loss and sorrow, female experiences. The routine of death strengthened a respect for the dead, rebooting related symbolic content and ritual practices. At the same time, an erosion of the mental foundations of traditional culture occurs due to the fundamental changes in the conditions of prolonged war.

DT Article
DE sanctions; Russia; European Union; CFSP; European Parliament; historical

AB Sanctions of the EU against Russia are an important example of success achieved by the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) of the European Union. For the first time, all EU member-states have overcome serious divisions in the aspect of the foreign policy and taken a common stand. This article is dedicated to the investigation of motives for imposition of anti-Russian sanctions from the EU-side as well as the analysis of disagreements in Europe concerning these sanctions and their reasons. Possibilities of softening and cancellation of sanctions are considered by the author, wherefore the mechanism of political decision-making in the European Union and a possibility of various political powers' and member-states' influence on this mechanism is explored. Considerable attention is paid to the analysis of the party political spectrum in the EU and its member-states regarding the implementation and prolongation of sanctions against Russia, and to the scrutiny of reasons for disagreements among them. The differences between national political parties and their fractions in the European Parliament, a regional controversy as well as a potential influence of Brexit on the EU sanction policy are noted in the article. The EU member-states can be divided into three groups in terms of their attitude towards sanction policy against Russia: hardliners, mainstream-states and soft-liners. The presence of these groups provides sustainability of the European Union's common stand. The mechanism of political decision-making in the EU makes the attitude of the leading member-states determinant. Positions of the sanctions opponents in the European Parliament, in hardliner- and mainstream-states are very weak, and adversaries themselves are disconnected. For softliner-states, the significance of the EU is greater than that of Russia. The stance of the European political mainstream, according to which main sanctions could be cancelled by implementation of Minsk agreements only, is expected to remain stable.

AB The problem considered in the article is urgent as modern psychological practice needs to determine the structure and content of the term "the corruption act". The purpose of the article is to determine the conceptual structure of the corrupt act, the contribution of structural components to the overall system and to verify the conceptual structure by empirical research. The main method of investigating this problem is the method of reconstructing the component structure of the corruption act of convicted people for a corruption crime (in correctional institutions). The structure of the corrupt act is a multicomponent psychological formation componentally isomorphic to a system of professional activity. The interaction within this structure forms new structural components (levels): reflexive, regulatory, motivationally-objective, activity-important qualities (anti-professionally important qualities of the subject). The model of the structure of the corruption act allows to formulate the concept of "the corruption act", to propose three stable types of structures of the corruption act, and to define invariant components of these structures and their main features. It will allow to develop methods for selecting, predicting and preventing corruption acts of a person who takes responsible decisions.

DT Article
DE Republic of Korea; democratization; fight against corruption; political

AB The article reviews the modernization of the social and political system, state economic management and foreign policy strategy in postauthoritarian South Korea. It looks at the factors that contributed to the success of the South Korean democratic transition, including the strengthening of the legislative branch and the empowerment of the National Assembly, political liberalization, increment in activity of the civil society and non-governmental organizations, as well as emergence of new forms of an Internet-driven political participation of South Korean citizens and youth. Although the number of political parties in South Korea that absorbed the interests of various social groups greatly increased in the postauthoritarian era, the majority of political forces are predominantly elitist and are formed on a regional basis. Those parties proved unable to control the President and top executives thus undermining the credibility of the government. The article also explores the evolution of relations between the government and big business, arising from administrative and economic reforms. Although the South Korean government undertook notable steps toward market openness and liberalization, which significantly enhanced transparency and reduced overall state intervention in the economy, it could not eliminate the top-level corruption that triggered the political crisis in 2016-2017. Finally, the article explores the impact of the democratic transformation in South Korea on its foreign policy strategy, including relations with major foreign counterparts as well as South Korea-North Korea dialogue. The growing demand of the South Korean society for a more independent global posture leads to modification of foreign policy which stays loyal to the military and political alliance with the United States while taking steps to diversify political and economic ties.

DE quality of life; innovative region; social and cultural development;
   Special Economic Zone
AB Tomsk Region has a high innovative potential. It is ranked fourth in Russia among the most innovative regions. At the same time, according to the social and economic criteria, the region is only on the 27th position. Underdevelopment of social infrastructure, low investment attractiveness, along with severe climatic conditions, have a negative impact on the quality of life in the region. In this regard, it seems relevant to consider how successfully innovations are introduced into the regional economy. The study showed that the largest contribution to the development of the region's innovative economy is provided by the Tomsk Special Economic Zone (SEZ). However, the situation is complicated by the fact that since 2016 the maintenance of the SEZ has been transferred to the regional level. Managing the SEZ infrustructural development is a difficult task for the region's economy. Already now, the SEZ began to lose its positions in the rankings and is characterized as a SEZ "at the development stage or requiring improvements". There is also another disturbing feature: the abolition of tax benefits. It is important to note that the benefits were one of the main incentives for entering the SEZ by innovative companies whose existence is associated with increased economic risk. This measure threatens the outflow of residents, and hence investors, from the SEZ. In social and economic terms, the SEZ still has a minimal impact on the regional development. The city changes that happened as a result of the SEZ include the construction of the Pushkin and Baltic road junctions, the repair of the Bogashevo airport and its international status, the construction of a fire station serving not only the SEZ, but also the surrounding areas. However, to maintain the status of Tomsk as a city convenient for life, this is not enough. The introduction of new technologies should go hand in hand with the growth of people's well-being. The awareness of the need for an innovative path is possible only in the society in which its basic needs are fully satisfied. The societal development promotes the improvement of innovative technologies, which in turn must change people's living conditions for the better.

AB After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Sea of Azov and the Kerch Strait, previously a single maritime space of one state, had became the subject of an interstate dispute between Russia and Ukraine regarding the determination of their legal status and delimitation. The article analyzes the legal and political positions of both sides and their conformity with the modern international law norms, and the national interests of each state. The advantages of keeping the legal status of the internal historic waters under the full state sovereignty of both states with regards to the Azov Sea are considered; the negative aspects of the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention's norms and provisions application to this marine area, leading to a decrease of its legal status and the appearance of third countries' legitimate interests, are analyzed. The Russian-Ukrainian treaties and agreements concerning this issue are examined, and the negative consequences of their denunciation are described. Examples of how the status of internal historical waters can be applied to the maritime region of joint use of several states, and why the status of the common natural and economic complex preservation for the Azov Sea is more in interests of both countries, are given. The problems of the Kerch Strait water area's legal status are touched upon, and the most acute plot of modern Russian-Ukrainian relations, namely, the construction the Kerch bridge, is not bypassed. The facts about the international practice of settling this type of disputes are given; legal claims of the Ukrainian side to the construction of this kind of hydraulic structures critically analyzed. Finally, the article shows how the entry of the Crimea into the Russian Federation led to a fundamental change in possible claims of Russia and Ukraine, as well as to the fact that the settlement of the situation on a number of issues in these areas has become even more difficult.

DE post-phenomenology; pre-reflexive cognitive activities; modality of
   perception; pre-modal matrix of consciousness; synaesthesia
AB The problem of pre-reflexive foundations of consciousness and mind has always been crucial for phenomenology. This problem has acquired a new perspective in the contemporary studies of the embodied mind. Bodily preconditions of consciousness are comprehended in neurosciences, psychiatry, psychoanalysis, analytic philosophy, pragmatism and post-phenomenology. Perception, spatial-corporeal orientation, body memory, day-to-day actions, psychological contact of a human with his own body, sense-gaining by means of gestures are considered as access points to the embodied mind. The author aims to study the perceptual level of the embodied mind by associating psychological data with phenomenological problems. Phenomena of an intermodal transposition, also referred to as synaesthesia, are in he focus of attention. The author hypothesizes that synaesthetic reactions not only have cognitive consequences but also are a pre-reflexive form of the embodied mind. She confirms her view with by analyzing the results of experimental studies of grapheme-color synaesthesia and color hearing of professional musicians. M. Dixon's experiments of grapheme-color synaesthesia show that ambiguous graphemes are perceived in different colors depending on whether test subjects see a number or a letter. Consequently, a synaesthetic reaction is not a result of perception of shapes or lines, it is caused by the meaning of graphemes in the context. It is also significant that most musicians with color hearing sense the keynotes of tonality in color, not the pitch level. It is not a certain chord, for synaesthetic musicians see the color of the keynotes during the musical composition, even if the keynote chord does not sound now or there are modulations in other tonalities. They rather hear the common center of harmonic gravitation in color. Notably, synaesthetic musicians lose these color sensations when they hear atonal music. In doing so, they hear enharmonic sounds and chords which have the same pitch levels but different notations in different colors. These important moments of grapheme-color synaesthesia and color hearing indicate the presence of a bodily-cognitive level of consciousness on which perception and meaning attribution are indistinguishable. Here occur the processes that can be defined as simultaneous processes of perception, thinking and meaning attribution. Namely, here we have the opportunity to observe a work of the embodied mind.

DE exaptation of Christianity; religion in modern Russia; tradition
AB The article analyzes the transformations of the social system that occur as a result of the use of its resources by other social actors. Using the example of the use of the heritage and the potential of the religious tradition for the construction of social stereotypes, ideologies, mythology in contemporary Russian society, the author concludes that, with the preservation of the name and stereotyped image of them, we are dealing with something fundamentally different from their original state. The ideological reception of religion in the post-Soviet period, when it fulfilled the role of the most important resource of creating a civic identity, is estimated as an exaptation of religion. This term, borrowed from Slavoj Zizek, is an instrument in the analysis of the transformations of the religious system. Thus, the author points to the ambiguity of the traditional manifestation in the religious sphere, where tradition neutralizes the protest, the intensity of faith transforms into world-accepting and world-affirming social practices. As a result, rituals, customs, forms of socialization, cultural artifacts as external manifestations of religiosity begin to prevail over internal religious experiences, spiritual search. The next important thesis about the connection between traditional thinking and negative identity is illustrated by an analysis of discourses on the themes of ideology, traditions, places and role of the church in society. Negative construction of identity uses various forms of exclusivism, primarily ethnic and religious. This process is accompanied by active social myth-making, which allows legitimizing one's own position. Tradition, in fact, is designed by intellectuals who have political, ideological intents. The attitude to the heritage is selective: only resources that allow one to substantiate their version of the tradition are used; historical events receive a free interpretation, cultural artifacts are used to articulate modern senses. Tradition is meaningful for everyone, and it formalizes religious experience. From the point of view of self-preservation, faith as a tradition is preferable for a social system. The social community, striving for self-preservation, transfers charism from personality to the formed tradition. The collective interest becomes sacred. Thus, Christianity for a structured social system is a dangerous deviation that threatens its existence; it is not traditional.

DE Wittgenstein; first incompleteness theorem; algorithmic proof;
   constructive proof; model theory; semantics
AB In recent years, Wittgenstein's remarks on Godel have produced many disputes and publications. The discussion overcame the framework of historical and philosophical research, and directly touches upon series of problems adjacent to the proof of the first incompleteness theorem. After the publication in 1956 of Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics, Kraisel and Bernays attributed a total misunderstanding of Godel to Wittgenstein. There were also apologetic readings. To date, almost all friendly or hostile interpretations consider Wittgenstein's remarks irrespective of the mathematical (purely syntactic) proof of the first incompleteness theorem (Wittgenstein's notes must allegedly be understood in the context of the semantic and philosophical implications of the theorem). Among such interpretations it is important to point out the historical and philosophical studies of Floyd (proofs of unprovability are considered here in the context of Wittgenstein's general position regarding the proof of the impossibility of certain geometric constructions). Or there are attempts to see Wittgenstein as the pioneer of paraconsistent logic. Undoubtedly, the semantic and general philosophical consequences of the theorem are of great importance today, and can be better understood in the context of Wittgenstein's remarks. In the article, the author considers the friendly reading of Wittgenstein by Putnam and Floyd (also considering Bays' criticism) (Parts I and II of the article) and the ground-breaking reading by Lampert (Part III). Lampert is notable for the following: he was the first to propose an apologetic reading of Wittgenstein under the condition of correlating the remarks directly with the proof of the first incompleteness theorem (Wittgenstein's approach to algorithmic and metamathematical (constructive) kinds of proof is also considered). In the final part, the author briefly dwells on the difference between two selected interpretations of Wittgenstein's remarks and on the general context of Wittgenstein's attitude toward Godel.

DE person; poetry; word; soul; destiny
AB In the history of Russian philosophy, there were many outstanding thinkers who are authors of original philosophical ideas and authors of sublime poetic imagery. One of them was Konstantin Aksakov, a Russian philosopher, publicist, historian and poet. He viewed poetry as a way to nurture human feelings by rising to spiritual ideals. For him, poetry was not only the sphere of realization of his creative work, but also the subject of his philosophical research. Aksakov developed an anthropological approach to the study of the essence and history of the language. He believed that the word was the distinctive feature of a person, by which a person organized life in accordance with moral laws. A person may be inclined to do both moral and immoral acts. The word is deeply connected with a person's essence, and varies depending on the person's inner experiences. However, one changes oneself and one's fate by distorting the meaning of words. The historical path of the development of the humankind is also inextricably linked with the historical stages in the development of the language. Aksakov distinguished ordinary words from poetic words. Ordinary words express feelings of different moral value. Poetic words give an unconditional moral value to human feelings. Wondering about the spiritualizing action of poetry, Aksakov distinguishes three stages in its development: from poetry as an abstract idea of art to the embodiment of this idea in specific literary works of different artistic merits and, finally, to high samples of poetic art. He expressed confidence that the birth of a poetic genius is possible only with its direct connection with the national literary heritage. A genial poet creates works that become the property of all humankind and perpetuate the phenomena of the human spirit. Aksakov saw the role of poetry in the spiritual life of a person in the fact that it helps one overcome the imperfections of one's temporary existence, and reveals manifestations of eternity in one's temporary existence.

DE European Union; Brexit; achievements and marginal phenomena; national
   elections and the future of Europe
AB The founders of the European Union dealing with urgent problems concerning the reconstruction of post-war Europe in the remote perspective started establishing the ongoing supranational structure provided with integral elements of sovereignity. Now they are facing challenges that are questioning European and world political development. In order to maintain the achieved and to move the European process of integration forward, it is essential to envision when, how and with what attainments and losses European politics would (or would not) be able to integrate a transforming European Union into a changing world. This/article discusses the challenges facing the EU, its problems and dilemmas. Nowadays one of the most severe challenges that the EU faces is Brexit. The unidirectional expansion of the EU's integrated economic and political space has been seen a change for the worse. Its consequences are not clear enough yet, but Brexit can pose some serious challenges. Degenerative changes are taking place in the countries where the basic principles of the EU are being violated - in Poland and Hungary. At the latest elections the parties originating from the anti-communist movements came to power and now are restoring the new form of authoritarianism. As a result, the threat of these countries falling out not only from the political area of the EU, but also from the legal one has become a reality. The latest elections in a number of countries-members of the EU, including the key players of the integration process - Germany, France, Italy - have revealed another serious problem - the increasing support of nationalist and populist parties and movements. In recent years two controversial processes have been clashing in the EU in a paradoxical way. On the one hand, the destructive movements and parties are enhancing their positions in the national politics. On the other hand, forces that promote various plans and scenarios of reorganization of the management system of the EU, delegation of the most important functions of the financial and economic activities, international politics and defense strategy to the supranational political bodies are also emerging to the forefront of European politics. Contradictions between political forces that are interested in further promoting integration and governance on the EU level and those that seek to destruct the Union will most likely have a strong influence on the modification of the European political space, causing exacerbation and unexpected reversals of these processes.

DE ethics; helping professions; job burnout; work motivation
AB The relevance of socio-philosophical analysis from the standpoint of the ethical and sociocultural foundations of helping professions is due to a dynamic change in the values of society and the reflection of these changes in the motivational profile of a specialist in helping professions. Being a special kind of social activity, the profession of the socionic profile contributes to the creation of a space of the main directions of people's life activity (medicine, education, social support, etc.). Therefore, it is necessary to take into account the need to identify two approaches to the definition of the object of activity of the helping professions that form their axiological basis. It can be said that the object of the helping profession at different stages of its historical development has its own specifics: at the first stage from the 17th to the beginning of the 20th century, from the moment when the professing professions were closely connected with philanthropy and applying the client-oriented approach in rendering assistance to the "needy", until the later stage of the development of the cluster of professions in the 20th-21st centuries, where humanism already replaces the values of utilitarian effectiveness dictated by the Soviet state and the object of assistance in this period is no longer an individual, but a social group of people united by an artificially unified problem, through the introduction of standardization and KPI in the organization of assistance. At the same time, activities in helping professions remain focused on helping individuals in need to integrate them into society with optimum quality. Specialists in the socionic type professions remain sufficiently autonomous in their activities, which necessitates the need for additional (in addition to normative and legal and technological) moral reflection of their own behavior. This gives grounds for determining the elements of different models of the motivational profile of specialists in the helping profession, taking into account their moral values, as well as the modes of being, answering the main question: what effect do they have on the quality and results of conducting professional activity by a specialist in relation to the object - the "needy".

The traditional penitentiary system shows helpless when it comes to imprisonment of extremists. The article examines the problem of radicalization among the incarcerated in places of confinement. The author touches upon the following questions: What do radicalism, radicalization and de-radicalization mean? How does radicalization take place? What stages does the process of radicalization flow through? What are de-radicalization measures taken by the governments? To what extent are these measures effective? The research demonstrates that while the traditional penitentiary system only exacerbates the process of radicalization of terrorists we still do not have a universally applicable and effective alternative yet.

ID RATIONAL-EXPECTATIONS; INATTENTION
AB The article is devoted to the role of the information background in household decisions on consumption-savings. The issue of behavioral prerequisites for decision-making has lately become the mainstream of economic theory. The crisis of the "absolutely rational subject" as a concept led to the development of theories of bounded rationality and to the search for noneconomic determinants of micro- and macroeconomic processes. As a result of interdisciplinary studies conducted at the intersection of psychology, sociology, political science and economics, modem economic theory has been enriched with new approaches and concepts that better describe the reality than models based on the axiom of homo economicus. The main limitations of the rationality of economic entities include the imperfection of information that is available and is at the same time reliable, as well as the necessary costs of its processing plus the probability of errors. The present study is intended to make a contribution to this theory by investigating the impact of the information component in the form of economic news on the behavior of Russian households in terms of disposition of available incomes. The research was based on a selection of news for 2006-2016 by the main television channels of the Russian Federation - the most accessible and trustworthy source of information for households according to public opinion polls. The news was evaluated as negative or positive with the help of linguistic and semantic analysis, and afterwards an econometric analysis of the relationship with economic indicators was performed. It turned out that an increase in uncertainty (expansion of the "spread of negativity and positivity" news) leads to a choice in favor of current consumption, which leads to a reduction of savings as the national investment base. In addition, the authors analyzed the relationship between the tonality of news and its dynamics with the business cycle. The analysis revealed that the "information" cycle correlates, with a certain lag, with the business cycle.

   phenomenology
AB This paper zeroes in on an example (paradeigma, argument based on parallel cases), which is, according to Aristotle, one of the two modes of rhetorical persuasive arguments. It was an idea of Vittorio Gallese, a prominent cognitive neuroscientist and neuropsychologist, one of the discoverers of mirror neurons, concerning the close relationship of simulation mirror resonance mechanisms and Aristotelian paradeigma, that served as a motive for the paper. First, the author considers Aristotle's interpretation of paradeigma in detail. In so doing, the appropriate paragraphs of Rhetoric and Prior Analytics are examined. After that, to make the paper self-contained, the key conception of transcendental appresentation (analogizing apperception) is briefly outlined as it was introduced and considered by Husserl in the Fifth Cartesian Meditation. The ground of this cognitive procedure is formed by the embedded and embodied mechanism of pairing, which makes it especially interesting, when a rhetoric example is concerned. With that in mind, the author proposes a novel reconstruction of paradeigma based upon the phenomenological conception of apperception, which provides the comprehension of a situation-as-stimulus in accordance with a paradigmatic model example. The core feature of this reconstruction lays in a very specific premise asserting the sameness of the stimulus and the model example within a certain category. The author consider this cognitive procedure to be grounded in a more fundamental faculty in charge for categorization and typefication. Thus, Aristotelian paradeigma (a) accompanied by an appropriate syllogism ad hoc (b) corresponds to Husserlian apperception containing pairing (a) and apperceptive transfer of sense from a model object to a new stimulus (b). The author argues for essential irreducibility of a rhetorical example to standard types of deductive and plausible arguments, including inductive generalization and analogical inference. The closing section sums up all the above and provides a suggestive explanation of the persuasive power of a rhetoric example.

AB There is a certain gap in Russian research and generalization of the world experience in the development of eco-campuses, as well as in the analysis of Russian practices to see how the issues of greening campuses are understood and implemented by Russian universities. The paper is designed to fill this gap. The first part of the paper explores the leading models of eco-campuses implemented in the world. Based on the features identified, the main components of the eco-campus are aggregated, and strategies of greening universities are identified. The second part of the paper is devoted to the analysis of environmental practices of Tomsk State University (TSU). This study is intended to determine which constituents of the eco-campus model are already being applied in TSU, and to outline possible strategies for further development in order to comply with world practices in this field. As world practice shows, universities create eco-campuses to achieve several goals that range from the creation of a comfortable and sustainable campus environment to the achievements of the leadership in promoting the principles of sustainable living being an example of how these principles can be implemented. Tomsk is often called a "university city" due to the presence of six large universities in it. This title suggests a more advanced, innovative development of the whole city, which should be provided by the spillover of knowledge from universities to the "city", the prevalence of highly skilled employees with a large share of scientific and technological personnel in it. Due to the fact that Tomsk universities have urban, not suburban, campuses, their synergy with the urban environment is quite high, which means a high degree of influence of the university on the development of the whole city. TSU actively uses various practices to interact with various stakeholders in the field of environmentally sustainable development, but they are not implemented systematically, which reduces the effectiveness of this interaction significantly. The initiatives of TSU have a great innovative potential and can contribute to the formation of a "green" infrastructure, ensuring the improvement and "green" development of the city and the region as a whole. However, for the full-scale use of this potential, TSU needs to develop a systemic and operational strategy, which allows creating a full-fledged eco-campus and become a driving force in the processes of developing a "green" city.

DE "flying intelligentsia"; Nikolai Yadrintsev; rhizome; university; youth
   migration
AB In the paper, further possibilities to use the concept "flying intelligentsia", introduced by Nikolai Yadrintsev in his work "The Flying Intelligentsia" (Fact from Provincial Life), are analyzed in order to explain the current processes of young people's migration in the Siberian region. For such cities as Omsk, the outflow of university-educated specialists becomes one of the indicators of the region's depressiveness, and is associated with a low level of social well-being. It is noted that the totality of today's phenomena regarding migration of educated young people in Siberia can be treated in terms of "flying intelligentsia" proposed at the end of the nineteenth century. The author believes that the analogy with rootless plants, drawn by Yadrintsev, is no less productive for the analysis of youth nomadism than the rhizome - the rootstock of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. If the rhizome is rooted, even having no central stem, the aquatic plant floating in the current is a more accurate analogy. There is a connection between rhizome discourse and university discourse. The Siberian University, according to Yadrintsev's views, was to grow its own "rooted" intelligentsia and serve as a magnet for "flying intelligentsia". The Siberian University coped with its task before the period of active university construction in the mega-region. Today, when educational integration and mobility require commitment, the nomadization processes of the Siberian students' community are becoming relevant again. A productive analysis of educational migration in the Siberian region is possible only on the basis of works by researchers that observe its origins.

AB In 2017 oil production in Venezuela, a country with very large if not the world largest recoverable oil reserves, declined by 12-13%. In the authors view, the main cause of the decline is subordination of the oil and gas sector to serving the irrational macroeconomic course. The economic and foreign debt policies pursued in the last two decades did not allow Venezuela to take advantage of the opportunities opened by the ongoing transformation of the world oil market. Sanctions imposed by the US in August 2017 against Venezuela's government and the central bank as well as state national oil company PDVSA heavily increased the risk of the nation's bankruptcy. From the position of independent and active player in the world oil market Venezuela is rapidly descending into a passive object of global oil policy. According to some estimates, cumulative foreign obligations of Venezuelan authorities and PDVSA already exceed 190 billion dollars. The bankruptcy of Venezuela seems unavoidable, even though it could be delayed by the current rise in oil prices and benevolent attitudes of the largest creditors. In the situation of deep economic and political crisis the government purged the top management in the oil sector. In order to prevent further production decline the new management announced seemingly relevant policies, including renewed stimulus to foreign investors in oil extraction. However, the overall irrationalism of the current economic policy prevents realization of relevant sectoral measures. Being in the latent default the government announced plans to issue a cryptocurrency petro supported by oil reserves. Petro is seen as a tool to abort widely spread financial speculations and to achieve de-dollarization of national economy. Political opposition qualified the cryptocurrency as a new fraud scheme of selling oil by using prepaid contracts. The US Treasury considers the digital currency emission plans as an extension of credit to the Venezuela's government what may be exposed to US sanctions' risk.

AB This article presents a review of a conference Debt: 5000 Years and Counting that took place at the University of Birmingham (Birmingham Research Institute for History and Cultures) on June 8-9, 2018. The conference was based on the recent influential book Debt: The First Five Thousand Years by David Graeber. The conference gathered representatives from all social sciences to discuss the understudied topic of history and ideology of debt. The review contains references to several papers discussed at the conference to give an idea of the approaches used in one way or another in many of the papers. The papers discussed in the review were devoted to the boost of micro-credit in Latvia after the 2008 global financial crisis, the ideology of trapped equity that led to this crisis, the attempt to resolve confusion between the view that debts are to be repaid and the view that profiting from lending is evil, credit in the Islamic Caliphate in the 7th to 10th centuries, the long duree of public debt since the Middle Ages to Early Modern times, and the royal debts in England in the middle of the 16th century. The conference was interesting not only because of the importance of the subject but also because of the originality of the format which helped make the event less hierarchical and less dominated by the academic elite. In addition, one of the aims of the conference was to combine academic and activist approaches. Among the participants there were a few activists. This experience is also described in the review.

AB The article examines the history of relations between the United Kingdom and the European Union from the 1950s till the present. The analysis emphasizes the impact of the European issue on national party politics (the relationship between the conservatives and labours, the interactions within major parties) and the British society. On the basis of historical analysis, the paper concludes that there was no stable consensus on membership in the EU throughout the whole period under review. Positions differed both on current policy issues and on the UK's strategic place in Europe. All UK governments were Eurosceptic in the sense that they objected to the increase of EU powers. The deeper was integration into the EU, the stronger Eurosceptic views were in the British society and political elite. Euroscepticism became more and more "tough"; Eurosceptics objected to the status quo and claimed weakening of the EU or the UK's exit from the EU. The political and even ideological gap about the functioning and development of the EU between London and continental Europe has steadily widened.

AB The accelerating restructuring of world energy balance, promotion of alternative sources of energy, shift in global energy demand to the Asia-Pacific region, strengthening of political and economic positions of national state energy companies in developing countries, enjoying a priority access to hydrocarbon assets, and other related factors place substantial pressure upon oil supermajors. Traditionally this small group of the world largest private vertically integrated oil companies play the role of a driver of the world oil market. The goal of the present article is to analyze the adaptation of European and American supermajors business model to the new circumstances of development. The analysis proves that the largest private vertically integrated oil companies remain one of the most dynamic player in the world oil market. Both European and American vertically integrated oil companies are constantly rebalancing the portfolio of oil extraction projects, using the competitive advantage of the highest order, namely the cutting-edge technologies. European supermajors more rapidly develop the natural gas business, compared to the American competitors. Of special importance is the fact, that after big deals, involving mergers and buying of assets, Royal Dutch Shell and Total became the leading players in the rapidly evolving global liquified natural gas market. In the last few years leading European oil companies intervened into a principally new direction of business - electricity. Pilot projects in the sector of new alternative energy sources, natural gas based electricity generation, smart grids and e-charging stations for electric vehicles allow the European companies to develop capacities to manage heterogeneous businesses and get ready for the integration of the latter in the general corporate structure.

AB In the article, the knowledge society is interpreted as a society of dangers and catastrophes, a society of generated risk in which security has acquired the status of the highest value. The very problem of risk is designated as embodying the paradox of modernity: the dominant resource of a society soaked in science is simultaneously a source of dangers and catastrophes. The article made a hypothetical attempt to find a universal measure of risk in the knowledge society by addressing the potential of a number of approaches.
   The knowledge society is designated as a society of sustainable development and at the same time as a society of renewable risk. Risk is attributed to the characteristic features of sustainable development. Science is called a means of modern politics, a decisive means of achieving sustainable development. It is shown that the universalization of risk was the basis that made the problem of "risk safety" a problem of paramount importance. Awareness of the magnitude of risk is interpreted as a preventive function. The situation of risk is designated as related to decision making; The context of the knowledge society, as shown in the article, forms an increase in the decision-making potential. The perception of risk as a solution, the calculation of possible losses associated with uncertainty, the calculation of benefits, limiting the scale of future losses - all this shapes the view of risk as a form of decision-making.
   The phenomenon of acceptance associated with the situation of acceptance or curing of decisions made by political and social institutions is considered. It is shown that the optimal approach to risk situations will be provided when the nature of the risk, its probabilistic nature, various aspects of the safety of the technologies being developed, will be analyzed at an interdisciplinary level. Risk assessment is interpreted as a multifactor phenomenon, which should take into account the measurement of potential damage, the possibility of risk management through the use of projective scientific potential, safety standards, Risk-Impact Analysis techniques, quantitative parameters of risk comparison, probabilistic risk assessment, expected damage, formal risk standard ("Objective risk").
   The thesis on the necessity of using the potential of the method of mathematical modeling and statistical methods in the evaluation actions is grounded; methods of decision theory and the theory of expected damage - these methods determine the possibility of calculating the total and hypothetical probability.
   The article substantiates the thesis that the limits of risk can be calculated using such approaches as formal-normative, psychological-cognitive, cultural-sociological.

AB In recent years the states of Central and Eastern Europe have been developing collaboration with the states of the South Caucasus. The greatest success has been achieved by the Check Republic and Azerbaijan. The topic has not been examined thoroughly in Russian and foreign Political Science. Therefore, the purpose of the given paper is to study the dynamics of the development of relationships between the Check Republic and Azerbaijan in the early XX-th century. The author uses statistical and comparative methodologies with the aim of analyzing the political and economic collaboration of the two states. The conclusion is made that the Check Republic holds the leading position among the states of Central and Eastern Europe in the development of collaboration with Azerbaijan and the whole region of the South Caucasus. The building of political dialogue between Prague and Baku boosts the enhancement of relationships in various areas. Pragmatic approach overshadows human rights issue in Azerbaijan, which is occasionally brought up by some political groups in the Check Republic. Both parts take an interest in resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, in expanded collaboration of Azerbaijan and the EU as a well as expanded bilateral trade links. Baku has an interest in Check investments and technologies whereas Prague needs Azerbaijan energy resources in order to lessen its dependence on Russia.

AB The paper examines the European Union's democracy promotion policies in Tunisia and Egypt in the 2010s, aimed at promoting democratization. After the Arab Awakening, the EU has undertaken considerable efforts to help both states in the process of democratic transition, but the actions of Brussels had a different effect. In Tunisia, whose authorities after the 2011 revolution expressed their commitment to democracy, the EU assistance played a very constructive although not a decisive role. In Egypt, where the EU found itself in an extremely competitive environment, Brussels failed to promote the country's democratic development and advance its own agenda. Thus, the EU had to return to a pre-2011 model of relations, based on cooperation with the Arab governments, which were not democratic but capable of ensuring stability in the neighboring region the problems of which tend to spill over directly to Europe.

DE Eurasia; the EU; Russia; Trans-Arctic; security; geopolitics; space;

AB Russia-EU relations are regarded within a framework of the ongoing author's "Trans-Arctic study", which allows to consider new formats of global interaction in the Arctic macro-region, often referred to as conflict-free. Behind the "conflict-free Arctic", the hybrid policy of "Smart & Intelligent Power" hides, which is fraught with the erosion of identity in the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation (AZ RF). Soft-power risks, which are brought to the AZ RF due to transformation of the Russia-EU interaction paradigm, are its part. The modernized "Northern Sea Route" and huge natural resources of the AZ RF are a colossal "capital" of Russia, which cause envy and generate the wish of foes to exercise economic, political, cultural and information control over this "capital". The multiplier of these challenges is the growth of global significance of the "Eurasian-Arctic field" in the Trans-Arctic, where the "soft-, smart-, intelligent-, sharp-power" has become a popular instrument of foreign policy. An analysis of the EU's ambitious integrated Arctic strategy and its model of interactions in the region suggests that in the near future, the European Union's presence in the Trans-Arctic will remain limited. And "soft-power risks" generated here by the EU will be "broadcast" to Russia through the actors of the Trans-Artic multi-level management system, who are closely affiliated with Brussels. For a safe Russia-EU interaction in the "Eurasian-Arctic Field" of the Trans-Arctic or in the AZ RF it is necessary to elaborate a new model, which would take into account the risk of "soft-power and sharp-power" intervention - the one that will not allow to awaken the dormant conflict-generating force of the Trans-Arctic.

AB The present paper considers various forms and practices of power-related interaction in the political system of modern society. It is noted that the institutional-normative and structural-functional aspects do not reflect the variety of forms and types of communication between public and power. The authors substantiate the methodological position according to which the activity of political subjects should not be considered in traditional theoretical and methodological coordinates, where attention is paid only to "positive phenomena", and power communication is not analyzed from the standpoint of "negative structures", i.e. those aspects which are not recognized as being fit into the dominant type of political and legal activity, into the framework of the emerging social order as a whole. The formal, informal, shadow and other power practices that exist in today's political space are considered in the work from this position.

AB The basic question of the concept of human rights is who actually has human rights. In other words, who is the human subject as the bearer of human rights and whose rights should be protected? The basic answer is people: they possess human rights simply because they are humans. But the notion of "person" or "people" as the bearer of human rights has changed significantly in the history of the development of the human rights concept. Entire groups by racial, gender, age and other criteria were refused to have human rights "by default" for a long time. In the period of antiquity, the bearer of human rights is an exceptionally free adult man living in a polis and satisfying other conditions, including doing military service and owing property. In the Age of the Enlightenment, the idea of a universal equality of everybody appears and is affirmed. However, along with this, slavery continues to exist, and no one seriously discusses issues concerning the possible equality, for example, between men and women. Children and many other social groups cannot realise human rights. In the mid-20th century, after World War II, a new stage in the development of the concept of human rights begins. In this time, the list of rights and the number of their bearers increase. The ideas of a universal equality are reflected in international documents binding for all countries. The rights of women, children, disabled people, etc. are described separately. However, the problem of the actual implementation of equality in rights is still far from being fully resolved. There are new challenges. One of the topical questions is when exactly a human becomes a human, in particular, whether the unborn have rights. From his decision The policy in the field of abortion depends on the answer to this question. Can animals have the same rights as humans? Should human rights be granted to robots? Thus, the issue of who the bearer of human rights is is still topical nowadays.

DE serial criminal; serial killer; causality theory; social factor of
   crime; psychological factor of crime
AB The article reveals the algorithm for evaluating the research value of individual causality theories of serial crimes. Despite the fact that the theories under consideration have both theoretical and practical significance, each of them has strong and weak aspects. Analysis of these aspects was the aim of the study. The result of the study was an analysis of the advisability of applying social and psychological theories of causality to serial crimes. In the conducted research, the following general scientific methods were used: analysis, synthesis and system-structural one. The following private-science methods were used in the study: biographical, statistical, comparative-historical analyses and expert evaluation. Among the factors useful for determining the value of the theory of causality of serial crimes, the following criteria of analysis were assigned: the content of the theory; the typical image of a serial criminal, resulting from the content of the theory; theoretical consistency and value; practical value and scope; empirical validity; strengths of the theory; weaknesses of the theory; political and doctrinal bias; current state and development prospects. These criteria were used in the content analysis of a group of social and psychological theories of the causality of serial crimes. This group includes such wellknown social theories as the feminist theory, the theory of subcultures, the theory of myth, and such psychological theories as the theory of personal destruction (psychotrauma) and the theory of evolution. The feminist theory explains the criminal behavior of serial criminals as the absolutization of the spirit of aggressiveness inherent in men. The theory of subcultures emphasizes the existence of social strata possessing a system of social behavior and values that exists separately from the dominant system of behavior and values. The theory of myth develops the thesis about the conspiratorial nature of separating serial crime as a method of social control of the population. The theory of personal destruction (psychotrauma) presupposes the existence in the structure of the psyche of a serial criminal of the destructive effects of psychotrauma obtained in childhood, as a rule. The theory of evolution is based on the idea that the behavior of serial criminals is not a manifestation of their degenarality, but reflects specific evolutionary changes in the psyche. One of the main ideas is the thesis about the targeting of each theory of causality of serial crimes.

DE science; system-communicative approach; philosophy of science;

AB The authors analyse the universal problem of scientific theorising: they study the definition of the principles of scientific communication. The authors find out whether scientific communication is an arbitrary option or it is the subject of the research that determines the sequence of steps that should be done to reconstruct theoretical description. The authors also pay attention to the concepts and terms that are necessary to begin scientific research. In order to implement this task, the authors turn to the ideas of the German sociologist Niklas Luhmann, who developed a contemporary system-communicative approach. The authors use Luhmann's ideas to study not only society, but also the social system of science. From the point of view of Luhmann and from the point of view of the constructivist methodology, distinctions should be used as a starting point of research. It is noted in the article that such distinctions should have a preference embedded. The authors justify that the sum of these differences can be reduced to a sequence of bases of scientific research or, which is the same, of scientific communication. The authors analyse the sequence of some concepts: complexity, difference, concept, limitation, theories, methods, scientific explanation, scientific problem, scientific project, scientific publication and scientific discipline. In order to determine the correctness of such "foundations of scientific research" and for the definition of scientific truth, the authors refuse to apply the traditional criteria of correspondence and adequacy of a theory. They summarise that the "best" theory is the theory that uses concepts that provide a larger observational survey. The authors recognise concepts that determine their own context and limit the conditions for the possibility of truth, thus becoming the conditions of limitation, to be the conditions of truth. The principle of limitation creates a general framework of the possibility of truth judgements, separating the complexity of the system and the uncertain complexity of the world. The authors note that limitation determines the correlation of theories and methods, external and internal references. The authors consider the interest of comparison to be another basis of scientific communication. It is noted that the interest of comparison as a search mechanism of scientific knowledge counterbalances the different conditions of the system. With the increase of empirical data that are used for comparison the limitations of possibilities to compare also increase. Thus, limitation of comparison contributes to the clarification of the scientific problem. The communicative function of the scientific method, as the authors argue, is to eliminate the epistemological risks of the excessively bold theories. The method organises a medial substrate, imposes the rules of its verification and measurement. So these rules then should be used to confirm or disprove the values of truth and falsity of qualitative judgements, ascribing the importance of the problem to some judgements. The authors point out that the conjugation of methods and theories determines the "game space" of science where the game represents itself as a testing of various explanations that are understood as the instant coherence of a concrete theory with a specific method. The meaning of the explanation is in the current verification of the validity of a given coherence of theory and method.

ID PATRIMONIALISM
AB The article is devoted to the analysis of the regional political regime on the example of Kemerovo Oblast. The article considers modern domestic and foreign typologies of political regimes, their correspondence to the realities of Russian regions. The practice of actual gubernatorial control over the arrangement of the main political and economic regional players in Kuzbass does not allow us to speak about the balance of branches of power in the region. The author, in his analysis of the problems of the regional political regime, relies on a neoinstitutional methodology. Studies of regional political regimes presuppose reliance on verifiable methods of analysing socio-economic and political processes in the region that allow us to identify the unique architecture of the regional political regime. At the same time, it is difficult to count on success, basing only on statistical and empirical materials. For success, it is necessary to keep political processes that partially overlap a particular region, take into account national political trends and perspectives that inevitably affect the perception and evaluation of local regional processes. The political order in most of Russia's regions is characterised by the prevalence of policy over economy. Institutional processes here are regulated mainly by informal conventions. In Kuzbass, power and property constitute an indivisible institution. Features of the regional regime in these conditions are: the phenomenon of "power - property"; redistribution type of economy; class model of stratification; orientation to the preservation of socio-political processes, and not to the innovative development of the region. The relationship between power and property is built around the theory of the administrative market with the dominant role of the regional bureaucracy. In Kuzbass, the formation of a free competitive market was not completed, and interest groups form a system of inequalities by the criterion of the opportunities for rental access, determined by the attitude of the first person (the governor). Stratification is of a cast-paternal, closed character, and is a derivative of the degree of possession of imperious resources. The regional political regime assumes the architecture of power on the basis of the "power - property" relationship and the formation of the ruling elite uncontrolled from civil society. Kuzbass business for many years mostly avoided solidarisation, preferring backstage arrangements with the governor of Kuzbass and his clientele. The boundaries and opportunities for regional cliques in the adoption and implementation of political (state) decisions are primarily determined by their links with informal and formal institutions of power; the personal composition of participants in these entities; compliance of resources and objectives of these associations with the regulatory restrictions existing in the state. The results of their activities can be judged by indirect data and, above all, by the results of the distribution of tangible and intangible resources in society, demonstrating the true beneficiaries of regional management. In Kemerovo Oblast, due to the poor quality of institutions, the apathy of the population, the weakness of civil society and the lack of control of the ruling elite, shadow structures (cliques, clientele, clans) currently have a decisive influence in approving regional policy goals and making key management decisions.

DE social liberalism; political ren; victimhood culture
AB With the "decline of labour society" and its transformation into the "rental society", the political struggle comes down to a struggle for the redistribution of rents. Political ideologies and movements also undergo a transformation into a "rental format", as evidenced by the growth of right and left radicalism and populism. The article shows how exactly the transformation of social liberalism into the rental format of "victimhood liberalism" occurs. The article describes the most characteristic features of the "victimhood culture", under the influence of which this transformation takes place. In the "victimhood culture", subjects insist on their victimisation. Thus, they acquire a higher moral status than criminals. In a situation where violators are oppressors and victims of the oppressed, it also increases the moral status of victims. This reinforces the incentive for new complaints and means that oppressed parties are particularly inclined to emphasise their victim status. The "victimhood culture" combines high sensitivity even to hints of "insult" and greater dependence on third parties. One perceives any form of "domination" as an insult. Victimisation of the "insulted" is the main way to attract sympathisers. Therefore, instead of emphasising one's strength, or internal dignity, victims emphasise their oppression and social marginalisation. This study regards "victimhood liberalism" as an ideological rationalisation for the search for political rent by various kinds of "minorities". In it, the status of the victim is a resource that gives rent. The mutation of modern social liberalism lies in the fact that this kind of liberalism simultaneously considers its subjects as "suffering classes" and accepts them as social and political subjects who are obliged to use their position of victims to solve their problems. The political design of this strategy, based on an appeal to state arbitration, turns it into a search for political rent. But now this search is becoming a strategy of an increasing number of people from the lower classes, and not just from elite groups and their close associates.

   politics; the old order; the liberal world order; the euro-centrist
   world; crisis; twilights
AB The article attempts to identify and analyze the most important factors of the crisis of values, ideas, principles of the liberalism that underlie political democracy. It is shown that liberalism and political democracy themselves represent answers to the challenges created by the transition of countries and peoples of the West from the Middle Ages to the New Time in the 16th-18th centuries. Being oriented toward a radical break with the past, they laid ideological and political foundation for the Great Transformation, in the process of which the new capitalist rationalistic civilization based on such values as human rights and freedoms, market economy and rule of law replaced forms of the medieval state system. It is emphasized that they originated in a relatively narrow group of peoples of the Euro-Atlantic world and played a huge role in their economic, technological and social progress. At the same time, the thesis is put forward that liberalism and democracy being historical phenomena are subject to the laws of origin, triumph, gradual decline natural for human communities. Its validity is evidenced by the tendencies and processes that liberalism and political democracy have experienced over the past two-three decades when they reached the highest limit of their development, and in the eyes of the intellectual and political establishment of the West acquired the status of the ultimate Truth. The article shows the factors that contributed to absolutization and emasculation of the values of human rights and freedoms as well as of other related ideas and attitudes, as understood by founding fathers of liberalism and great reformers of the 20th century. The main focus is on substantiating the thesis about possible completion of the liberal order domination era in the states of the Euro-Atlantic region at the country and global level. On that ground, it is concluded that we are witnessing the onset of a new era characterized by tectonic shifts in the existential basis of life with global reach, an existential shift that is equally large, perhaps even superior in its consequences to the Great Transformation that the Western world survived with the transition from the Middle Ages to the New Time.

DE language; history; Foucault; Coseriu; philosophy of language;
   structuralism; comparative analysis
AB The point in common of the French philosopher Michel Foucault and the German linguist (and philosopher of language) Eugen Coseriu (who wrote in several languages, Spanish and French, German and Italian) is that they belonged to the latest ("third") generation of structuralists. Structuralism moved beyond particular disciplines (linguistics, ethnology, history) and became an interdisciplinary philosophical methodology of human sciences. Also, it preserved a particular interest in classic problems of philosophy and linguistics: being of language, history and historicity, sign and meaning. This paper aims to compare the main ideas of both scholars about the connection of language and history. The author of the paper shows that the structuralism of Foucault and Coseriu tried to solve the antinomies of the classical philosophy of language: synchrony and diachrony, structure and change, derivation and determination (classical philosophy of language was often based on the methodology of physical sciences). Our authors solved some important antinomies of classical structuralism, but they seem to have created some other ones, especially those of conscientious and unconscientious structures in linguistic activity.

DE cynicism; P. Sloterdijk; postmodernity; modernity; Enlightenment
AB The article is devoted to the analysis of the modern phenomenon of cynicism in the context of its interpretation as a critical-reflexive form of worldview. Analysis of the phenomenon is based on the concept of cynicism by Peter Sloterdijk. Sloterdijk defines cynicism as the dominant form of modern consciousness. Cynicism is considered as a meta-historical phenomenon of consciousness, showing its specificity depending on the social and cultural conditions of the era. The specificity of modern cynicism is associated with the historical experience of the 20th century, the change of two sociocultural dominants - modernity and postmodernity. The features of postmodern culture are considered. It is noted that the situation of postmodernity can be characterised as a situation of "cultural trauma" (Piotr Sztompka). This situation is characterised by an increase in negative expectations in anticipation of any social change and a lack of confidence in the ideas of progress. The situation of trauma characterises the social, historical and emotional context, which acts as a medium for the formation of the subject, with a specific type of world perception, the result of which is the formation of a cynical form of worldview and reaction to the world. Structurally, cynicism corresponds to the end of any epoch. Within the structure of postmodernism, cynicism manifested itself as a further radicalisation of critical thinking presented in the Enlightenment. The postmodern revision of the basic attitudes of the entire Western culture led to the question of the possibility of obtaining reliable knowledge and truth. An individual finds oneself in a situation of uncertainty and impossibility of finding a stable basis of existence. This leads the individual to the need to remain in the position of cynicism, as the only stable orientation of consciousness, allowing to evaluate and interpret events. On this basis, cynicism is interpreted as a form of a critical-reflexive worldview, based on doubt about the possibility of achieving value universals, whose main values are personal, selfish motives, denying the possibility of development of society, etc.

DE Dilthey; history; humanities; interpretation
AB Dilthey's Critique of Historical Reason is the result of a profound analysis of metaphysical concepts from the Antiquity to the end of the 19th century. In this period, historical science did not exist from a methodological point of view. It was heavily influenced by philosophy or natural sciences. Dilthey's negative attitude towards philosophy of history is predetermined by his anti-metaphysical position. According to Dilthey, the search of the essence of historical science beyond its limits is not allowed. Therefore, the historian must occupy the position of a scientist, in whose interests there are only facts that are subject to impassive study. Human culture, in Dilthey's view, deserves the status of an object of an independent scientific study no less than nature because it possesses its specific properties that do not lend itself to the tools of natural sciences, in the application of which a proper result is obtained. History as a science has its advantages and drawbacks because of the subject and the object of the research that coincide in it. Self-awareness is the ability that allows us to successfully penetrate into the human world and create the most complete picture of humankind. We ourselves create sources of history, which become a "text". Scientists will be able to extract a part of the whole studied area and build it into a scientific knowledge in the future. However, it is impossible to finish the "history book". It needs to be studied within certain boundaries. It is possible to investigate the states or ages chosen for this, or one can accept the fact that it is an ongoing project that has certain regularities that cannot be predicted. For Dilthey, the existence of humankind takes an eternity, which is an area subordinate to history.

DE literature; text; author; reader; Roland Barthes
AB In 1968 a significant essay by Roland Barthes called "The Death of the Author" was published. It was a kind of manifesto of a new type of literature. This small text reflected a turning point in Western culture, when the very historical situation required the development of new values; it has not lost its relevance today, half a century later. The traditional role of the author as the legislator of the meaning of a work was called into question in Barthes' revolutionary project. However, this did not imply, as it might seem, the end of fiction. On the contrary, the idea of the author's death entails, as a necessary consequence, the statement of the immortality of literature. There is an attempt in this paper to reconstruct the main intentions that motivated Barthes to create his theory of literature, which he understood as the embodiment of the dynamic life of the language. Another task is to reconstruct his theory in the form of a holistic system of views on the contemporary literary process. The art of the modern era - compared with the classical one - underwent fundamental changes. Not the author, but the language is the main actor, which directs and determines any narrative. In such a linguocentric model, language from the medium of the transmission of ideological content turns into the space of the emergence of thought. First of all, it asserts the plurality of equal readings, challenging the habitual position of literary criticism, according to which the author's interpretation is the only true one. Such a polyphony of interpretations presupposes an increase in the role of the reader, who - as a co-creator of meaning - is now endowed with the same rights as the writer. Desacralisation of the author changes the status of literature itself: being deprived of the functions of "teaching and witnessing", which, according to Barthes, make it an instrument of ideology, literature acquires the necessary freedom to capture the spirit of the time, which, in addition to the will of the author, is preserved in the very fabric of the language.

DE Euroscepticism; European Union; Church-State relations; Christianity;
   religious institutes
AB The paper deals with the attitude of Christian Churches to the Euroscepticism. The author states that the Euroscepticism in the religious context is not equal to the primitive Fundamentalism (with xenophobia and intolerance elements), but could be described as a complex political phenomenon that supports the existence of European structures. The Catholic Church became a traditional base for rethinking of integration processes. The Catholic worldview is supported by state and semi-state Churches of the Western and Northern Europe, in the first hand, the Lutheran Churches of Germany and Scandinavian nations. They are allies of all European institutions because of their traditional loyal position towards authorities and their own liberal evolution. A decentralized structure of the European Orthodoxy determines the diversity of opinions and different impressions of the European future. The role of the Churches in the context of Brexit in the United Kingdom is analyzed particularly. Inside political clashes over the unity of Europe, the liberal Anglican Church and conservative Catholic Church are on one pole. On the opposite pole, there are the critics and enemies of the EU - the conservative Fundamentalists from the Evangelical Protestant Churches. The political spectrum of Christian worldviews is represented in the majority of European countries. The main components of the Christian Euroscepticism are: the defense of evangelical values rooted in the Bible (that unites Orthodox Christians, Catholics, conservative Protestants-Evangelicals); promotion of the Christian legacy of Europe (that unites Orthodox Christians, Catholics, Lutherans, less Evangelicals); preserving of a national peculiarity against infringements of a liberal bureaucracy (that unites Orthodox Christians, less Catholics).

It shows that empirical statements are not conclusively verifiable for, at least, the open texture of the terms involved. We cannot conclusively verify statements in which empirical concepts are used, because we cannot define these concepts in an exhaustive way due to their open texture. The author proposes interpreting the open texture as a possibility of vagueness; vagueness can be remedied by giving more accurate rules, the open texture cannot.

DE fashion; sociality; G. Simmel; justice
AB The article reveals the methodological importance of the principles of economy and modern social theory. The question of the possibility of thorough thematisation of the newest type of sociality by converging the discursive tools of economy and modern social theory is posed on the example of Georg Simmel's philosophical position on fashion. The prospects for interpretations of fashion as a cultural form that establishes social justice, as a form of the social "universal" responsible for the establishment of a universal public order are discussed. It is shown that the general theoretical reception of fashion as a social practice demonstrates its special hybrid status due to which fashion is in contact with diverse discourse fields responsible for the variety of representations of sociality. The subject of the discussion is Simmel's philosophical sociology. His concept of "forms of socialisation" treats the latter in the spirit of the universal cultural and social universals. One can talk about them in isolation from a specific historical content. But this does not prevent Simmel as a theorist from describing separate cultural forms as historically transitory and changeable. They declare themselves at a certain historical moment, have their own reasons for the emergence and their own history of "cultural socialisation". All this is only to indicate the general direction in the movement of a social formation as such. Simmel names fashion among similar forms. The article reveals the methodological significance of the economic horizon of representation, the mechanisms of the accumulation and exchange for the adoption of fashion as a significant cultural social practice that contributes to the establishment of a more equitable redistribution of public goods.

This paper aims to analyse the temporal and topological traits of the cultural and symbolic capital of the Tajik youth that study at Russian universities, as well as the possibility for Tajikistan to provide world-class higher education in the English language for future professionals. The author provides a detailed study of the governmental initiatives of both countries that intend to resolve the contradiction between the falling quality of education in Tajikistan and the increasing requirements for entering Russian universities. Since a large number of the Tajik youth aspire to enter Russian universities, teachers from Russia are now invited to work in secondary schools in Tajikistan. In the paper, the author focuses on the situation when after graduation from Russian universities, a part of the Tajik youth stays in Russia, thus helping construct a society of the "new Russian Asians" - active participants in various aspects of life in both Russia and Tajikistan. The methodological basis of this paper is formed by the works of Pierre Bourdieu; the empirical data was collected in the course of individual in-depth interviews with students of Tajik origin and heads of national Tajik diasporas in Siberian cities.

AB The factors and patterns of revolutionary dynamics are analysed on the empirical basis of the Italian and German revolutions of 1848-49. The article uses a theoretical-historical approach in comparative political analysis that includes shuttle movements between hypotheses and systematic comparison of cases for their verification and correction. The factors of the creation of a revolutionary situation are clarified and the hypothesis of "replenishment" of the missing factors is tested. The revolutionary wave effect is treated as an external influence of successful revolutions in neighbouring and/or highly referential societies. The principles of the interrelation in the revolutionary period of internal political dynamics and geopolitics are formulated on the basis of historical sociological and political studies generalisation. Military victory always raises the legitimacy of the victor, whose role can belong to a revolutionary government, a republic, and a counter-revolutionary monarchy. The bright military victories of the imperial centre marginalise an opposition, increase the loyalty of the border regions, and reduce the support of the separatists. External defeats intensify the political crisis at the centre of power, which weakens its military power and strengthens separatism. The external defeats of post-revolutionary regimes delegitimise not only power and leaders but also symbols, slogans and ideology of revolution. The fate of revolution depends on which field of struggle will be decisive. During the crisis period the intuitive sensitivity of the leaders to slogans and rhetoric is most significant for mobilising allies and masses. Presumably, the demonstration of involvement in such symbols, ideas, social and political projects that most closely correspond to the world picture, values, identities and actual interests of potential adherents comes to the forefront. In the most difficult cases of an approximately equal level of legitimacy for the conflicting parties, the main role is played by the ability of leaders to make both adherents and opponents believe that they have a predominant legitimacy and inevitably win. Since the majority of participants (including elites and law enforcement agencies) are opportunistic and fearful of being on the losing side, the peak of confrontation usually does not last for more than 2-3 days, after which the victorious party acquires more supporters. The approach presupposes that military and international factors, which usually serve as particularistic explanations ad hoc, are included here in the general concept and are formulated in universal concepts. Thus, the revealed regularities can be used for analysing a wide range of other revolutionary waves.

AB This paper is a reply to the paper "How the Modern Age Science Has Enriched the Humanity" by Alexander Nikiforov. The paper represents the key elements of the Modern Age science critique. The arguments of Nikiforov are considered through the advocatus diaboli metaphor. The author shows that the arguments about the inability of science to provide answers to eternal questions do not hit the target, since they aim to underline that the Modern Age science fully succeeded at its epistemological purposes. The author considers Nikiforov's arguments as ideologically biased and unjustified. The author compares these arguments with the ideas of Albert Einstein in his essay "Science and Religion". She claims that this comparison makes all of these biases clear. It is shown that the Russian philosopher and the great physicist shared the same basic statements but, nonetheless, have come to the mutually exclusive conclusions about the value dimension of science. This fact shows the vulnerability of Nikiforov's thesis. The author argues that the value dimension of science inevitably depends on the connections of science with the other social institutions (state, religion, education and law). The most important point here is the openness of the social institutions and their ability to correct their own normative programmes in accordance with the current scientific recommendations. Scientific knowledge could contribute to the process of humanisation only with the institutional support which aims to provide its integration. The author claims that scientific knowledge acquires a personal regulative meaning mostly if it becomes a basis for any institutionalised social norm, especially legal one. The author concludes that the institutional aspect of the value dimension of science could make the discussion meaningful.

DE urban studies; global cities; connectivity; devolution; functional

AB The article examines the role of global cities and new urban forms, which Khanna considers as the main centres of the new emerging world order. Khanna argues that the new "connectography" is functional geography that becomes more important than traditional political geography. He predicts the advent of the era of connectivity. Connectivity is a physical thing because it means infrastructure: roads and bridges, energy networks, the Internet, and so on. Cities, separated by hundreds of kilometers, are connecting into multi-city clusters. These new urban forms become the main factors of economic growth. Megacities, new transportation corridors, power grids and connectivity technologies are replicating the map of the world, where instead of state borders there are connections provided with infrastructure. Humankind is actually transformed into a global networked civilisation, in which the key role is played by cities. In this world, national boundaries are nothing but irritants that can be overcome. The process of devolution accompanies urbanisation and expansion of the territory and the growth of the influence of new urban forms. Devolution leads to the erosion of traditional boundaries and the emergence of new urban formations. Multi-city clusters become decision-making centres that are more interested in developing connections and networks than in restricting territories and participating in conflicts. Conflicts have a negative impact on connectivity, and, therefore, are disadvantageous to those who extract profit from connectivity. Khanna argues that new energy discoveries and innovations have eliminated the need for resource wars, global financial assets are being deployed to build productive infrastructure. We are accelerating into a future shaped less by countries than by connectivity. Humankind has a new maxim - Connectivity is destiny. Khanna argues that the most connected powers, countries and cities will win in the new world order.

DT Article
DE nuclear and missile issue; the Korean Peninsula; denuclearization;
   dialogue; peaceful resolution; non-proliferation regime; conflict
AB The author examines the situation involving the North Koran nuclear and missile issue. It is argued that the crisis on the Korean Peninsula has been aggravated in the past years due to persistent striving of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to drastically increase its potential of mass destruction weapons and the means of their delivery. During a quarter of century, neighboring and most concerned countries have made numerous attempts to involve North Korea into negotiations in order to resolve the problem by peaceful means, but those efforts brought no positive results. The situation even deteriorated after the new dictator - Kim Chong Un - came to power in 2011. In the past four to five years, Pyongyang has removed all previous self-restrictions to initiate at full power a large-scale program of the nuclear and missile weapons development. The complication is that the DPRK is not willing to advance any reasonable ideas on how to find a way out of the present deadlock and categorically rejects any proposals regarding aimed at unilateral denuclearization of the country. Although the military challenge coming from North Korean experiments seems to be exaggerated by the American side, the major danger stems from their negative impact on non-proliferation regime. Quite clear that the DPRK demonstrates very bad example for some developing countries, which possess excessive military or political ambitions. On July 4, 2017, Russia and China, who attentively watch the developments, put forward a set of proposals regarding an incremental resolution plan for the Korean issues, beginning from moratorium on nuclear tests and simultaneous freeze on South Korean and American joint military exercises. However, those proposals did not find support on the part of the USA and its Asian allies. In this regard it should be mentioned that at the moment, one of the main obstacles is the lack of coordination and trust between the five powers most interested in the Korean settlement - Russia, China, the USA, the Republic of Korea and Japan. All this necessitates the launch of a regular multilateral consultative mechanism in order to strengthen control over the dynamics of the situation and accelerate the search of constructive ideas aimed at the achievement of comprehensive nuclear problem resolution.

AB The article deals with the most widespread form of labor activity among workers - the socialist competition, the conditions of its emergence, the principles and problems of its organization in 1945-1956. The place and role of this phenomenon in the system of production relations are also identified, its main results and indicators are determined. The aim of this paper is to analyze the labor activity of workers in the military-industrial complex of the Udmurt Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in the postwar period, to identify the forms and directions of this activity, its results. The experience of carrying out socialist competition in the defense enterprises of the Udmurt Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in the postwar period is investigated on the basis of archival sources from the Central State Archive of the Udmurt Republic and the Center for Documentation of Contemporary History of the Udmurt Republic. A set of general scientific and special-historical methods are used. It is necessary to distinguish narrative and systemic methods among them. As a result, the author showed that the military-industrial complex located in the Udmurt Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic took an active part in the socialist competition that covered all areas of Soviet society after the war, and achieved significant results. The saved funds and materials were sent for the restoration of the western regions of the country and for the development of the Soviet atomic project. In the course of the research, the author comes to a conclusion that for the working class of Udmurtia, the postwar socialist competition was of a mass character: the number of Stakhanovites and rationalizers increased; along with general factory and departmental employment, individual social obligations were accepted. Among the shortcomings of the postwar socialist competition, which was unfolded at the defense enterprises of Udmurtia, it is necessary to note formalism and bureaucracy, falsification of results, and absence of a single coordinating center. The author points out the leading role of the CPSU (B) in the development of social competition. The political line of the CPSU (B) in the field of labor activity of workers in the defense industry made it possible to compensate the shortage of material, financial and labor resources of the postwar period. The author concludes that this policy contributed to the rapid recovery and development of the economic potential of both the industry and the country as a whole.

   Computer games can serve as platform for the information wars, first of all, directed against the Russian youth.
   Destructive communicative strategy is used in the computer games devoted to World War II where the role and value of participation of the Soviet Union in a victory over fascist Germany is leveled. It is reached in fictional images of Russia in virtual reality which do not relies on objective reality of historical process and carries a negative connotation.
   Computer games are time the tool which can put motives of political and ideological hatred, xenophobia or hostility concerning any social group or the country.

AB The aim of this article is to determine the role of the Red Banner Pacific Fleet Theater in the historical development of the Far East, its interaction with society in the context of ensuring the interests of the state. The article is devoted to the formation of the Red Banner Pacific Fleet Theater in the 1930s. In this period, the theater became one of the most powerful instruments of political propaganda. With the rapid increase in troops and with the threat of war in the Far East, propaganda work in the army and fleet in the 1930s became very important. The management of the Political Department, the central military and political authorities all participated in the educational and propaganda work in the Red Army and Fleet. Based on this, issues of the ideological struggle with the enemy must be considered together with the problems of the whole complex of the activities of councils of war and political authorities of the Red Army. In historical retrospect, on the basis of archival materials, official statements and relevant media publications, the activities of the Red Banner Pacific Fleet Theater are considered as important factors of the spiritual and moral development and upbringing of not only the soldier but also the civilian population of the Far East. This problem is little covered in historical science. The author notes that the theater had a significant influence on the formation of the world outlook system of the Far East. Within the framework of cultural construction, the author characterizes the activities of the theater as one of its effective instruments. The author analyzes the influence of the Political Department on the repertoire of the theater. The repertoire was given great importance, since the main objective of the theater during this period was the formation of a correct political orientation of the personnel of the military units of the Pacific Fleet and the Soviet Army. Therefore, the staged plays indicate not only the reflection of the genre specificity of the theater, but also the specifics of the time. Thanks to theatrics, the state implemented social behavioral standards of the "soviet soldier" or the "soviet person", who faithfully fulfill their duty in the rear and at the front. These heroes were "models"; thus, the viewer's spiritual search was facilitated. The Political Department understood how theatrics affected the viewer, especially if events underlying dramatic works were of great importance. In the article, attention is also paid to the problem of organizing the creative work of the theater with a lack of professional staff among actors and directors. A conclusion is justified that the establishment of the Red Banner Pacific Fleet Theater was a timely measure, raising the socio-cultural sphere of life of the Far Eastern region to a new level.

AB In the course of their development, people created a special type of culture, representing a specific world of things, values, symbols, which embodied the image containing an idea. One of the key issues in various scientific fields is the definition of the very concept of "symbol". Nowadays, there is such a scientific discipline as symbol study. The authors of the article suggest to consider the origin and the evolution of the concept "symbol" in the context of historical process understanding. A symbol is one of the key concepts of the humanities and social sciences: the culturology of philosophy, sociology, history, psychology, linguistics, political science, ethnography, aesthetics, etc. During the study they established that symbols played an important role in the whole variety of human culture manifestations - in ideology and religion, politics and law, literature and music, painting and architecture, literature, etiquette, advertising and commerce. In its turn, culture can be represented in the form of a system of different symbols embodying the ideas, the ideals and the meanings by which people live in and which determine the development and the functioning of the culture itself.

Notwithstanding both the complex liaisons between power and the people, between the various layers of society, even inside different factions of the ruling elite, the system has remained virtually intact for nearly 40 years. Mass opposition protests and demonstrations just before the 49th anniversary of the revolution made it evident that the process of the Islamic regime formation has not been finalized. The protests became the biggest challenge to the Islamic regime since 2009, although they did not develop into a nationwide mass movement. The reasons for the demonstrations were very different - both political and economic. Most of the slogans reflected the discontent of the population with the economic situation. Demonstrators criticized not only the economic policy of H. Rouhani's government, but also Rahbar Ali Khamenei, the leader of the country, and the Islamic regime as such. The research provides characteristics of various political forces and elements of Iran's complex political system. Much attention is paid to the role of the supreme Shiite clergy in power and that of the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps in the country's political and especially economic life. Specifications of some religious and political clans that exert the greatest influence on the policy of the Islamic state are given. The author believes that the sustainability of the Iranian political system is becoming increasingly dependent on political and economic inputs, that the contradictions between the authoritarian nature of Islamic power and growing liberal tendencies in the slab and economy become more distinct.

DE India; United States; foreign policy; non-alignment; non-proliferation;
   Kashmir
AB The article covers the evolution of the US-Indian relations in 1947-2017. After gaining independence, India adopted nonalignment policy which made the US consider it an unreliable partner. However, the US needed partners for military and political cooperation in Asia badly after China became a communist country. In the 1950s, the US found such a strategic partner. It was Pakistan that participated a lot in establishing such military blocs in Asia as South-East Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) and Central Treaty Organization (CENTO). The development of the US relations with Pakistan made India turn to cooperation with the USSR. In addition, the US neither supported India in the Kashmir conflict nor acknowledged the communist China, which made the development of the US-India relations even less possible. However, having understood the prospects of complete losing India out of its sphere of influence, the US devised economic aid programme for India as well as agreed for possible military aid against China in Kashmir during the J.F. Kennedy presidency. However, after the death of both J.F. Kennedy and J. Nehru, the US-India relations started to worsen. The US preferred to develop cooperation with China that was an Indian rival for the north-eastern part of Kashmir. In addition, the US did not support India in its clash with Pakistan in 1971, nor did they approve the Indian nuclear test in 1974. Indian reluctance to give up its nuclear programme caused worsening of the US-Indian relations in the 1970s-1980s. Moreover, the Bhopal tragedy in 1984 when the gas leak incident at the subsidiary of an American company caused death and injure of several thousand Indian citizens harmed the relations between the two countries. After the end of the Cold War, India sought for improving its relations with the US both in economic and military issues. India's economic growth provoked American business interest in cooperation. In addition, military cooperation between the two countries developed. The nuclear weapon test held by India in 1998 harmed the US-Indian relations, because the US promoted the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. However, very soon the US continued developing its trade, science and technology cooperation with India. The 9/11 events and the start of the global war on terror made further military cooperation between the two countries possible. Growth of energy and nuclear cooperation between the two countries made cooperation with India more beneficial for the US than interaction with Pakistan. However, because of the position China holds in Asia and the US foreign policy strategy, India still abstains from claiming the leadership position in Asia. In general, the US-Indian relations within 70 years were determined by nuclear and regional security issues as well as the Kashmir conflict and the position of China in Asia. Moreover, these factors may influence the US-India relations in future, though to a lesser extent.

AB The article studies regional integration and its innovative forms as well as the formation of innovative environment as an important condition for strengthening the competitive advantages of economy.
   The importance of the article is stipulated by the need for conditions necessary to ensure progressive scientific, technological and socioeconomic development of the regions in modern economic, political, technological, social and other trends. This situation becomes evident in the asymmetry of economic development of the territories as a result of inter-corporate interaction intensity and different types of business activity in them.
   The purpose of this research is to identify the impact of cluster integration on the volume of innovative products, works and services. We solved following tasks: review results of the researchs dealing with interrelation of integration level and innovative activity at the regional level; ranking of regions in Privolzhsky Federal district of Russia according to the degree of integration and the volume of innovative production, works, and services; assessment of interrelation of cluster integration level and indicators of innovative processes. On the basis of evaluation of innovation activity, we divided the regions into the following groups: innovative-advanced, innovative-developed and innovative-developing.
   The authors' hypothesis is based on the rationale for the development of mutually beneficial partnership in the regional economic systems, which in turn contributes to the stimulation of innovative processes in the sectoral and territorial directions. The formation and development of innovation clusters can determine the further vector of progressive innovative development of Russia as a whole. The study was based on the methodology of cluster analysis and methods of empirical research.
   The results of the research in the field of innovative processes can become a practical basis for the development and implementation of innovative development programs in the regions of Russia.

AB We study stochastic voting models where the candidates are allowed to have any smooth, strictly increasing utility functions that translate vote shares into payoffs. We find that if a strict Nash equilibrium exists in a model with an infinite number of voters, then nearby equilibria should exist for similar large, but finite, electorates. If the votes are independent random events, then equilibria will not depend on the utility functions of the candidates. Our results have implications for existing models of redistributive politics and spatial competition, as the properties of pure-strategy equilibria in such games carry over to equilibria in games with arbitrary candidate preferences. On the other hand, candidate utility functions will matter if the individual voting decisions are correlated. In the presence of aggregate uncertainty, such as changing economic conditions or political scandals, the preferences of parties and candidates with respect to shares of votes will have an effect on political competition.

AB The article examines the main methods of managing political investment risks at the corporate level, as well as the role of the assistance from the state and international agreements aimed at protecting foreign investments and ensuring investors' rights. Corporations use various instruments of risk management. The state, which itself is one of the sources of political risks, at the same time takes a number of measures aimed at reducing them for the national business entities. By concluding multilateral and bilateral agreements the governments provide a legal basis for protecting investments from political risks. Of great importance is the system of insurance of risks, in which the role of the state is also great. Finally, by taking measures for maintaining good overall political relationships with other countries, the government creates prerequisites for reducing the political risks of the national companies 'foreign investment activities. In Russia, the state pays certain attention to reducing political investment risks. At the same time, one can not help but see that the deterioration in political relations with Western countries that occurred in recent years has sharply increased investment risks for the Russian companies ' foreign activities. It is possible that some support for Russian investors could be provided by state programs aimed at improving the perception of Russian business abroad. Nevertheless, it seems obvious that the actual reduction of political risks in the foreign investment activities of Russian companies would be facilitated not by certain programs, but by the normalization of political relations with the leading developed countries. Russia's participation in international agreements aimed at reducing investment risks seems insufficient. Being outside of the process of drafting new agreements, Russia is deprived of the opportunity to influence the outcomes. In the future, the need for multilateral regulation of political investment risks will further increase. Russia's long-term economic interests will be met by expanding its participation in the development of a legal framework for regulating political investment risks at the global and regional levels.

SO STATUTE LAW REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB The age of globalization involves a rapid change in all areas of social life, which requires legislative bodies to monitor constantly various social processes, with discussion and introduction of new methods of legal regulation of social relations. However, their possible mistakes are a great threat to society. To minimize them, the Soviet lawyers created the theory of legal experiments, which has been repeatedly tested in practice and proved its viability. This concept was widely used in the 90s of the last century in terms of the reforms of land relations, local government, law enforcement agencies, and the field of environmental protection, which allowed cancellation of a number of inefficient patterns of the social structure. Increase of the guarantees of the rights of citizens and their associations requires further development of the concept of legal experiment, methods of its conduct, means of interaction with the public, and forecast of negative effects, which will reduce the risks of premature legislative decisions. The scope of application of the legal experiment can include all post-Soviet countries continuing the process of economic, political, social, and other reforms.

DE philosophical anthropology; personalism; personality; individuality;
   communication
AB In this article, the basic positions of personalism in the sphere of building philosophical knowledge about the human are explicated. The author explores these positions based primarily on the philosophies of Emmanuel Mounier and Jean Lacroix. He first describes the problem of defining personality as a form of being that does not lend itself to objectification. The concept of personality in personalism turns out to be very non-strict. This concept can not define personality as a subject of anthropological discourse, but it is capable of organising this discourse itself. Personality is always a project of a person who must become himself. Therefore, personality is anytime in the future, it is never available, it is only a task for the person, his goal. Personality is primarily "the desire to be yourself" (Kierkegaard). The author also considers the theoretical and practical aspects of the relationship between the philosophical concepts of personality and individuality. Man as an individual (individuality) is a set of "roles" that are in the state of conflict. A person as a personality is a unity in diversity, an integrative form of a person's conscious presence in the world. Then the author explains the understanding of personality as a transgressive communication in the philosophy of personalism. Personality is active in its self-definition. In his movement to himself, a person constantly goes beyond himself. This movement is not spontaneous, but normatively organised: the freedom to be oneself acts as a guide for such a transcending movement of personality. Freedom means overcoming the limitations and "impermeability" of the individual. Personality is open to the world and to all other people. Communication of solidarity is based on this principle of existential openness and love. In such communication, any personality is perceived as an absolute value. The high level of the value of personality is affirmed by the authority of the Absolute (God), who acts as a guarantor of human freedom in making responsible decisions and choices. The author maintains that in personalism, the philosophy of the human is converted into the practice of being a person, turns into a reflexive experience of finding oneself through a truly communicative existence, that is, through a responsible co-being with others and with the Other.

ID EUROPE; STORY
AB The concept "Second Demographic Transition" (SDT) plays an important role in the discussion about the demographic future of Europe and draws the attention of many researchers to this transition. The SDT theory was initially formulated by Dirk van de Kaa and Ron Lesthaeghe in 1986. They found that, since the mid-1960s, in many countries of Europe there have been significant changes in fertility and family formation patterns. The emergence of this concept required an explanation of what should be understood as the First Demographic Transition (FDT), since until then such a concept did not exist. One of the topics of the article focuses on the comparison of SDT and FDT, in particular, on the background and factors of these two transitions. The framework of the SDT theory has evolved over time, but its main points have remained unchanged. Th theory suggests a connection between changes in reproductive and matrimonial behaviour, living arrangements and changes in values - "ideational shift". The forms of marriage and family relations show a new dimension which hardly received attention in former times: the individual and independent choice of the partner, the equality of rights of partners, the importance of a lot of individual characteristics that match individual preferences, etc. The article deals with the idea, the phenomenon, causes and the extent of the universality of the second demographic transition. Despite the fact that the SDT concept is the mainstream conceptual framework of sub-replacement fertility and family changes, there is no consensus on its universality and sufficiency. The SDT theory suggests a hypothesis about the reduction of inter-ethnic heterogeneity in European countries through the "standard" sequence of demographic events. Moreover, the supporters of the theory emphasise the similarity in family formation and partnership behaviour in some industrialised countries of Asia, the Far East and Latin America, and predict the similar individual choice of living arrangements patterns. Can we find a convergence of marriage and partnership behaviour in different countries during SDT? Will SDT become a worldwide phenomenon (as the First "Classical" Demographic Transition) or will it remain "regionally diversified"? The article attempts to get closer to the answer to these main questions. The SDT theory has not only supporters but also opponents. In this regard, the article presents a critical review of the theory of the Second Demographic Transition.

DE care of the self; practice of freedom; aesthetics of existence; hedonism
AB The aim of the article is to analyze the ethical project that was created by Michel Foucault in his final years and whose conceptual core included a series of closely related concepts: "culture of the self", "care of the self", "aesthetics of existence", etc. Since this project had two correlated - historical-genealogical and ideological - dimensions, both of them are considered. The author also explores reasons and essence of the bias displayed by the philosopher when reconstructing the Hellenistic ethical model as well as the content of Foucault's own views on ethics which he defined as a "considered practice of freedom". As far as the genealogical side of the project is concerned it is based on a set of interrelated postulates. They are as follows. There is no universal human nature. The inner constitution of the modern westerner has been determined by the confluence of historically contingent conditions. It consists of a complex of heterogeneous historical elements. This complex can be transformed within the limits set by the previous development of that constitution. Though these very postulates contain obvious ideological implications, to the greatest extent does the ideological foundation of Foucault's project manifest itself when the philosopher outlines his own model of "culture of the self". Its conceptual core includes the following statements: The aim of care of the self is to become free. One needs to be free to cultivate knowledge and pleasure and, accordingly, to be free from the Law (in religious, metaphysical, moral and other senses based on them) that puts limits on the way to those objectives. Succeeding in such cultivation endows one's life with aesthetic value. The author arrives at a conclusion that Foucault's ethical ideal asserts the importance of an individualistic self-affirmation of the person on ways to transgression and hedonism. At the same time the problem of sense of freedom as a cornerstone of every ethical activity, according to Foucault, remains unsolved in his project. Plainly speaking, it sinks in the bad infinity of the ongoing widening of the borders of the permitted and experienced.

DE utilitarian understanding of science; cultural value of science;
   technology; truth; ethics
AB The article aims at a critical analysis of a thesis that science satisfies solely human biological needs through its technical applications beginning with its rise in the 17th-century Europe, while the cultural and spiritual development remains primarily the function of religion and morality. In contrast to this, the author demonstrates the limits of the utilitarian interpretation of science and technology which disregards their role in shaping the modern worldview. The article justifies an opposite understanding of science and technology as a valuable source of the general worldview and even the common sense features (the sphere of unquestioned foundations) of the contemporary generation. In this context, the sharp division between the biological (animal) and cultural (specifically human) needs appears obsolete for the modern society currently determines and even construes both of them. Science and technology receive here a particular and paradigmatic function. They serve as advanced cultural practices: selected and elaborated designs for the development of the individual and society based on the values of rationality, tolerance, reflexivity.

DE modern science; value of science
AB The course of modern science to pure truth is a reaction to the excessive moralizing and social determinism of the era. It is the desire of certain cultural industries to regain their specific functions and develop freely, without the total influence of the Church or the State. Science sought autonomy, which it had for centuries fought for in the struggle with the authoritarian mindset. If one interprets modern science as technoscience, it assumes that it has not sought to give its answers to existential questions. Its tasks lie in a different plane. Technoscience develops specific elements of life. However, their development would not have been possible if technoscience had not relied on the existential horizon in understanding man and culture. The existential-cultural context justifies the fact that technoscience is engaged in the development of human life and society. To provide means of human transformation, it is necessary to believe in it as a value. Modern natural science is a platform for the development of social and human sciences and plays an important role in the spiritual development of man and society. This development is the result of the humanistic and romantic mood of culture, on the one hand, and the experience of "homelessness" of secular culture, on the other. Spiritual development does not appear as distancing from the "ignoble" biological nature. Influenced by the ideology of the Middle Ages, the body and physical, biological needs were related to the sphere of shame in man and culture. Over time, these views have changed and physicality today is presented in different concepts as an integral part of spiritual development, as one of its bases and specific incarnations. Human physicality is included in spiritual formation, it is the result of ontogenetic, personal development manifesting its meaning and cultural components. Modern science has created the image of a scientist who works, explores and enters into communication nowadays. While treating science as technoscience, it is necessary to take into account a wide range of social-humanitarian research which studies humans as bearers of "human specificity" due to the modern view on personality.

DE antique culture; Greek rivalry; agon; F. Nietzsche; ressentiment; M.
   Scheler; cruelty; interdisciplinary analysis
AB The idea of "taking care of the self" and the ancient Greek agon are closely related. The situation of rivalry needs to be rationed. But the formation of "self-culture" also contains an agonizing element of competition with oneself. Friedrich Nietzsche's position and his analysis of Homeric competition are important to understand the nature of the ancient Greek agon. The ancient system of aristocratic education included physical training and agonism. The best person was selected by a competition. Greeks understood enmity and envy, which were usual in a competition, as valor. A person can get two important lessons from Nietzsche's analysis. Agon abounds in passionate states. In addition, competition includes different development possibilities: rivalry can be joyful and creative, but also can degenerate into a mutual and bloody torment. The analysis of the passionate, dark soul states proposed by Nietzsche on the material of ancient agonism was inherited by Max Scheler. Ignoring Nietzsche's idea of the connection of ressentiment with Christian ethics, Scheler paid attention to the very nature of ressentiment as a complex set of negative experiences. There are three important features here. Firstly, it is intense experience that can become the center of all the inner life of the individual. Secondly, it is deferred experience, revenge that waits for its place and hour. Thirdly and most importantly, it is ressentiment arising from the feeling of impotence, physical or spiritual weakness that makes a person restrain negative emotions. The nature of the shadow aspects of rivalry and its manifestations is un-rootedness in being and the value-built universe. Ressentiment as a pathology of the value sphere and a moral disease is able to acquire the character of an epidemic. Scheler's ideas about the painful manifestations of interaction in a society based on a "competition system" are relevant for studying the situation of the growing violence and aggression in the modern world. Special attention should be paid to the phenomenon of cruelty as a specific manifestation of human aggression. Clearly visible in the modern cultural space, it becomes a problem for philosophers, sociologists, criminologists. One of the most important questions of modern culture is how to develop a lifestyle in a competitive environment, how to learn to live with dignity without turning rivalry into a situation of conflict, confrontation, war. Manifestations of aggressiveness and cruelty are not self-sufficient. The study of cultural dynamics shows a certain rhythm that preserves the historical life: the archaic demonstrates the abyss of hatred, but the experience of the higher religious life on the cultural level of archetypes retains its own "musical" sounds. In the ethical sense, the highest values are salvific. Scheler cites Goethe's words: "Against the great superiority of another there is no remedy but love."

DE care of the self; state; church; Gregorian revolution; university
AB The modern classical university is considered as an extension of the original (medieval) university which was formed at the beginning of the second millennium AD as a supra-national social institution. The university supplemented the system established by the time of social institutions, including states, cities with their municipal authorities, the church, families, professional guilds, etc. The university remains a relevant system and an essential social institution in the present days and in the observable future. The conditions of careless questioning about the truth, which is its differential feature, are above all in the space of this social institute. The conditions of light-hearted questioning of the truth require a significant degree of institutional autonomy, which was and still remains the problem of the existence of the university. So, the modern network transformation of the university as offered by information technologies can result in its ability to distance itself from the expansion of other social institutions. The author acknowledges the heuristic actualization of the ancient idea of "care of the self" introduced by Michel Foucault. At the same time, the author argues variants of its hasty modernization in interpreting the worldviews of people of subsequent ages, and especially casts which doubt the correctness of its dissemination in the university community and among its representatives. "Care of the self" is the searching of microcosm to macrocosm. The Christian doctrine opened up the space, and macro-and microcosm its dimensions. The truth became the continuation of a conversation with God, with others before Him. The infinity of these dialogues is exempt from the concern of the final forms of the arrangement of life, the final formulas of truth: nothing is final; there is endless joy in query, questions and replies that give rise to new questions. In recognition of this priority carefree questioning gained the importance of an institutional form for allocating and even separating it from the church, through which the Christian faith was widely spread in Europe. Subsequently, Non-Churchism facilitated the penetration of the university in the space of non-Christian civilizations.

AB The actuality of subject raised is determined by the historical changes in society, class conflicts, the need to consider a structured system of exploitation of subordinate classes by a dominant class. The aim is to reflect the views of the followers of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels on a general approach to the analysis of society, where priority was given to economic activities and key discussions were limited to the central question of Marxism concerning the aspects in which the economic base determines the nature and the structure of society as a whole. The aim of the study is to identify a large space for a variety of applications of Marxist works in cultural studies, namely the majority of Marxist approaches to culture are a recognition that culture is created within the class to divide the community, and is involved in the maintenance and legitimacy of existing power relations, or resistance to this power.
   In the process of working on the article have been used different research methods: analysis, synthesis, theoretical research methods, mental modeling, comparison, comparison.
   The results of the study include the identification in the works of G.V. Plekhanov, G. Lukacs, E. Bloch, A. Gramsci, L. Althusser modern context understanding culture and class struggle. After analyzing a number of concepts related to the class confrontation, it is possible to suggest that cultural studies are more and more moved to post-Marxist phase. It should be emphasized that each epoch is characterized by its own economy and especially the structure of social classes, so the historical changes taking place due to the gradual economic expansion of the productive forces, the development of technology and the emergence of open class conflict and further development of the revolutionary process. Thus, it is necessary to conclude: Marxist social science is able to create strict laws that can facilitate the prediction of the historical development of a just society and the formation of its new structure, and also define a revolution as a progressive leap in the development of mankind, or destructive power. In addition, for the analysis of revolutionary processes should be based on knowledge of economics, political science, cultural studies, philosophy, sociology, social philosophy and other Sciences, to determine the understanding of the class struggle through the culture of communication of representatives of different classes. In my opinion, despite the rejection in the post-Soviet period, the ideas of revolution and class struggle, cultural studies and philosophy on the basis of historical and dialectical materialism is able to specify the methods and ways of solution of problems in modern society.

AB The knowledge society is interpreted as a society of generated risk in the article. The role of expert knowledge in decision-making processes is disclosed. Forms of integration of science into social structures and the new role of science in the pragmatics of decision-making are indicated. The role of procedural rationality in the development of justified expert decisions in the generated risk society is disclosed. To adequately assess the risks, it is necessary to address the possibilities of expert knowledge. A characteristic feature of the knowledge society as a society of generated risk is the expanded scope of democratic procedures for participation in decision-making. The problem of responsibility is shown in the priority positions. In the article, the author shows that the situation of the growing politicisation of science inevitably leads to the idea of the need for a stage of "expert examination", the formation of groups of "symbolic analysts" to conduct additional expert activities that allow reducing risks. The problem of the undeveloped methodology of "expert examination" is indicated as unsolved. The need to address the context and potential of new rationality is revealed. The methodology of an effective expert solution should be oriented towards the potential of procedural rationality. The thesis is substantiated that procedural rationality is based on reflection and a rationally planned attitude towards errors (the method of rationally planned problems and mistakes). The culture of decision-making is interpreted as a constituent and condition of procedural rationality. It is procedural rationality that makes it possible to assess the quality of the solution before the expert decision finds its application. A range of decision-making models has been determined, whose effectiveness in expert decisions is rather high (model of expected practical utility, models of intuitive decision-making, taking into account the connection of intuitive and rational decision-making in the development of adaptation mechanisms). The problem of confidence in the decision made by the expert community is considered, levels of expected confidence are determined. Factors influencing the degree and scale of the lack of confidence in the expert decision are determined. The thesis is substantiated that transdisciplinary forms of obtaining socially reliable knowledge allow reaching a new effective form of expert assessments. The role of implicit knowledge in the expert decision is shown. The thesis about the necessity of the theory of expert knowledge is disclosed; it is shown that the difficulty of creating a theory of this kind is explained by the lack of clarity of the role implicit knowledge plays in the expert decision. The author justifies the idea of the need for formalisation of implicit knowledge as an important condition for creating a theory of expert knowledge.

DE globalization; universalizm; multicultural globalization; cultural
   diversity; globalization
AB This paper mainly deals with two dimensions characterizing the globalization process: a universalist dimension which leads to unification of the world under aegis of the single dominating state, and a multicultural dimension which leads to establishing of world real diversity.
   The pinnacle concerning a discourse about globalization is registered in the nineties of the XXC. Theoretical debates in this period have different appraisals: from a negative definition of globalization as a global babble to a wide spread fascination for globalization. In spite of innumerable discussions and booms in the literature, the theorizing on this problem is in part developed. International Relations, Political Sciences, Sociology, Legal Sciences, etc. are all concerned with the analysis of the phenomenon of globalization, though globalization remains a pretty marginal topic for other disciplines. The discourse about globalization cannot be located inside one problem; it includes various dimensions, which extend the field of scientific knowledge and theoretical representation around the idea of globalization. Such discursive approach can be characterized as intersectional approach to globalization.
   In most recent theoretical debates, depending on the character of the process of globalization (homogeneous or fragmentary), two trends of investigation of this process arise:
   (i) globalization on the basis of the idea of progress which leads to an homogeneous world (universalism);
   (ii) globalization on the basis of representation of the world's real diversity (multiculturalism). Theorists of globalization stress the fact that an economic-homogenisation paradigm of globalization is becoming powerful in both academic and popular usage. They then focus their attention on the increased integration of the global economy and its homogenizing effects on state policy and culture. As for homogeneous (i.e universalistic) discussions, the tendency for many issues to assume opposite values-on the segment comprising versions of globalization and elite versions of globalization-arises. Even popular anti-globalist movements are nothing else but representation of the globalization process in alternative forms. S,contradictions, associated with the process of globalization are not external with respect to such process, but instead in it. Multicultural concepts of globalization based on the recognition of the world cultural diversity, are still popular because of their non-repressive and tolerant forms. Appraisals of multiculturalism as an intellectual trend, which could be evaluated as a core of recent multi-globalization processes, are controversial (as it is foe example demonstrated in the works by authors like J. Searle, R. Porty, C. Taylor, W. Kymlicka). The theorists on globalization stress the fact that contemporary globalization processes includes many instances of globalization.

DE American philosophy; market; discourse of bargaining
AB The article deals with the specifics of the spiritual life of America through the introduced category "market". An attempt is made to define the notion "American philosophy" through the discovery of common features of Ralph Emerson's transcendentalism, pragmatists, neo-realists, naturalists, and analytical philosophers. One of the most important factors that influenced the formation of American culture in general and philosophy in particular is the market - a special form of transactions and contracts. There also appeared a special kind of discourse, which the Russian researcher T. Venediktova designated as the "discourse of bargaining". As a form of communicative relations, this language practice has spread in all spheres of American socio-cultural life. Bargaining is not only an economic category, but also a communicative one; it involves the dynamism of the participants in communication, participation in bargaining can expand the horizon of one's "I", help learn more about oneself after learning that there is the other. The subject of this system constantly reassesses, overcomes the present state and any definition-restriction. Within the political process, representative democracy can be viewed as the exercise of political power in the process of exchange. It can be assumed that the dissemination of this discourse is wider, and its influence is stronger: the less the relations of people are predetermined and unchanged, the more important for them the freedom to choose their destiny, mutual circumspection and readiness for compromise are. Discourse of the market can serve as a model for an ideal "incessant dialogue", however, not the dialogue that implies the completeness of self-disclosure, attentive attitude to another individuality, but the kind of dialogue characterised by convertibility, substitution of truths, competitiveness, deception, manipulation, unpredictability. The author believes that American philosophy has a number of authors whose works can be interpreted through the "market" model as a special kind of an "incessant dialogue". Thus, Charles Sanders Pierce formulated the idea of a pragmatic approach consisting in identifying the meaning of the concept with its consequences, and his idea of fallibilism introduces the intersubjective agreement of the scientific community as a criterion of "intermediate truth". William James gave the pragmatic method of the all-encompassing region and established the "working capacity", the simplification and saving of the subject's efforts as a criterion of the truth of the idea. In the approach to explaining being, James uses the principles of pluralism and indeterminism: truth is not the result, the result of research, truth is an event, a process, its value and significance, and lies in the very process of its confirmation. In the works of John Dewey and George Herbert Meade the contextual characteristics of knowledge are actualised. Ideas, according to Dewey, are tools for practice, subject to improvement as new problematic situations arise. The communicative nature of culture and knowledge is especially evident in the concept of "solidarity as tolerance", of reaching an agreement based on an ironic attitude to opinions, values and beliefs, and on willingness to sacrifice them because of their non-absolute character. Thus, the ideal of a philosopher and philosophy is universal, but at the same time unique for every culture.
   The peculiarity of the American ideal that emerged in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and is in the force field of market practices, political democracy and a developed system of mass communications lies in its proximity to the game model and the "market", which implies adversarial cooperation, consensus, tolerance, recognition of the involvement of all subjects of communication. This type of discourse is not exclusive in the culture of the United States and, of course, is inherent not only to it, but, replicating itself through the business, political, journalistic, literary and philosophical word, it has become one of the most important means of self-creation of the American nation as a cultural whole.

AB Clarification of the bases of the Aristotelian approach to the interpretation of time and the specifics of post-Aristotelian studies allowed revealing the degree of the proximity of the classical theory and a number of non-classical concepts to the ordinary or instrumental representation of time. The analysis of Heidegger's counterargumentation to instrumental ways of interpretation of time which goes back to Aristotle is carried out. The counterargumentation shows Aristotle's ideas going beyond instrumentalism in the interpretation of time. The conducted research disclosed the incompleteness of judgment of the ideas stated by Aristotle on the basis of the ordinary or instrumental interpretation of time formulated as statements: (1) time is identical to the results of measurement of duration, (3) time is identical to the results of measurement of duration which is determined by the frequency or probability of events at the speed of a body close to that of light, and (4) time is identical to the results of measurement of duration which is determined by the frequency or probability of events in the perception field of the subject. According to Aristotle, time can be interpreted as a sphere in which the grammar of language expresses the horizon of the expected acts and states peculiar to people. Therefore, Aristotle fits the interpretation of time both into the context of statement (1), and in the framework of the thesis (2) time is identical to the basis of being, in versions (5) time is identical to the basis of being that coincides with the questioning type of being, and (6) time is identical to the basis of being that coincides with the subject type of being. The continuity of Aristotle's ideas and the instrumental interpretation of time as systems of measurement of processes are combined with an anticipation of alternative approaches to the interpretation of time. Time is related to the subject of a statement and shows the connection of representation of time and existential characteristics of anything thought to be included in temporal changes.

AB In this reply to Professor Nikiforov, the author critically discusses Nikiforov's arguments according to which science is inseparable from technology and has made a very small contribution to the moral development of the humanity. For each of these two points, the author argues that no convincing justification has been provided for them, and that they are false. In his discussion of the first thesis, the author argues that Nikiforov's arguments have not established a necessary connection between science and technology to argue that they are two component parts of a unique phenomenon. His description is just as well compatible with science and technology being completely different enterprises which only happen to co-operate within society. The author draws examples from history of science showing that a well-developed science could co-exist with a poorly developed technology further suggesting that the two phenomena have a different nature. The author also points out that in order for Nikiforov's thesis to stand, it must be shown that mathematical and logical research is not detached from applications and that its object of study can be reduced to the applications that mathematics and logic have. Finally, the author appeals to a novel research in STS suggesting that scientific ethos is special and has an impact on a scientist making the enterprise of science unique. Against the second thesis, the author points out that the idea that science and technology have not contributed to the moral development of human beings must be justified by a number of arguments. Among these arguments is an argument according to which science itself has no moral or artistic value. In other words, it must be shown that developing a scientific theory does not contribute to the esthetic legacy of the humanity. And if we assume the contrary (i.e. that the beauty of a scientific theory is on a par with the beauty of a musical symphony) we will get a direct refutation of Nikiforov's thesis. Finally, the author brings up evidence provided in Pinker (2011) suggesting that science has been one of the factors that allowed the humanity to reach a significant decline in hostility and violence.

DE science; technoscience; scientific ethos; philosophy of science;
   worldview
AB It is shown that the criticism of science and its achievements from the standpoint of the worldview which seeks answers to "meaningful" questions - why a person lives and what one should strive for - is incorrect. Alexander Nikiforov keeps a seemingly biased account of the losses and gains of the humankind in connection with the formation and development of modern science, but his conclusions are too radical: people have not become better in the moral dimension. What is more, science has contributed to the development of hedonism and consumer sentiment; hence, science is inhuman and immoral. The initiator of the discussion also states that philosophy of science, which built the image of the researcher living in an ivory tower (i.e. as beings that are objective, not interested in the financial "customer", generously presenting results of achievements for the general good), made the grossest error. The modern scientific picture of the world, especially cosmological, which completely banished the traces of any anthropocentrism, deprives people of courage and dignity. The modern worldview, based on the achievements of science, does not give humanity a moral point of support. These objections, from the author's point of view, recall the famous article "Dilettantism in Science" by A. I. Herzen. The great writer and philosopher visibly warned that the development of scientific knowledge would force to revise the usual everyday ideas and values. It is this adjustment that takes time, because in the face of the huge dangers that threaten the earthly existence of man (monstrous diseases, natural and man-made disasters, hard and hopeless work, etc.) only the development of science and technological progress allow us to hope for the best. The modern answer to the traditional question of Christian theology "What can I hope for?" can only be searched for in this intellectual space. Science, as now understood, is not supposed to interfere in religious matters, to touch the emotions of a believer. Polymorphism of culture is a challenge and an imperative of our time.

AB The article analyzes the question of the specifics of the New European approach to the study of the world. Technology played an important role in the development of scientific knowledge. The development of technology was not always accompanied with the development of science of the New European type. The experiment played an important role in the development of the New European science. Elements of experimental knowledge were present in the cognitive activities of other epochs, for example, in the Hellenistic era, but at that time it served to confirm the "speculative" knowledge of the world focused on the search for the "ultimate laws of the universe". The New European science has focused its efforts on "constructing" new research practices, tools and research fields. As a result, it seeks not only to explain nature, but through "constructing" to change it.

DE argumentation theory; formal philosophy
AB In the article, the author discusses Elena Lisanyuk's logic-cognitive theory of argumentation (LCT) and tries to show that it belongs to the sphere of "formal philosophy", whose ideology is formed by a combination of a 'logicistic' tendency towards total formalisation with a critical mindset aimed at the analysis of linguistic material. The argumentative interaction in LCT has the form of a dispute, which falls into three kinds: rationale, persuasion and practical argumentation. The formal apparatus of LCT is based on Phan Dung's logical theory of argument structures and echoes Henry Prakken's formal systems of argumentation. Rationale, persuasion and practical argumentation are modeled by formal means of LCT, where an argumentation system with specific properties is constructed for each type of dispute. Formal results concerning the possibility for non-trivial conflict-free sets of arguments to expand up to stable and encompassing extensions of their own make it possible, within the framework of the minimal system, to strictly express the properties of the weak and strong consistency of the position in the dispute-rationale. For the formal representation of the dispute-persuasion in LCT, a standard system is constructed, assuming the no longer "trustworthy" but "skeptical" semantics of the description of positions. The "internal" criterion of consistency is replaced here with the "external" criterion of persuasiveness, so that the opponent recognises only an argument that is safe from all attacks. The position is convincing if all its arguments are protected from all attacks of arguments of other positions. The weak point of LCT is the naivety of the terminological apparatus of the theory of argumentation: special meanings of word-terms are interwoven, first, with their ordinary meaning and, second, with their non-terminological use in the language of science. Their systematic differentiation for the whole theory requires the deepening of either cognitive (empirically oriented) or logical (theoretically oriented) components, but not the two of them together. In general, Lisanyuk's logical-cognitive theory of argumentation creates a good basis for the analysis of a wide range of communication phenomena, and is immaculate in relation to logical methodology, since it consistently differentiates the logical core and external data.

AB In response, a brief comment to the critical remarks is presented, as well as a summary of the discussion. The author provides further arguments in favor of the thesis that science and technology repeatedly increased physical strength of humans, human power over nature and created conditions for a prosperous existence, but this did not affect human morality. In contrast to this, there are increased global risks that threaten the destruction of the humankind, examples of which are global and local wars. The increase of the negative effects of technological development has not only failed to offset the growing moral consciousness, but also leads to a crisis of the latter in the consumer society. Science in overcoming this crisis has no chance to replace other forms of social consciousness.

DE "end of history"; creativity; personality; paganism; Christianity
AB The article discusses Alexander Kojeve's concept of the "end of history" in the context of the current state of culture. The presentation begins with the key notions of Kojeve's concept: Slave, Master, Citizen. The "end of history" is the "sublation" of contradictions between the Slave and the Master by the emergence of the Citizen of a universal homogeneous state. Before that, the Slave only labors, it is his duty; the Master only fights, it is his prerogative. The Citizen is involved in labor, as he created the state he lives in; he is also involved in fighting because he defends the state he created. Therefore, the Citizen unites and reconciles the Slave and the Master. The Citizen appears as the Artist in art. Before the "end of history" the Artist is not able to realize his potential completely. This incompleteness is reflected in the fact that perception stops at a thing the Artist created and does not "reach" his personality; there is no communication. The "end of history" is a condition when the Artist completely embodies his personality in a work of art. Therefore, through the perception of a work of art the personality of its creator is perceived; perception becomes communication. The "end of history" is the overcoming of the modern. The modern in its essential features begins to take shape during the Renaissance. The peculiarity of the ideology of the Renaissance, and further modernity in general, is that it is the result of the "diffusion" of Christianity and paganism. The mechanism of this "diffusion" is considered on the basis of the discussion of the Tabor light in the formulation of Gregory Palamas. To describe the differences in the Christian and pagan understanding of a work of art the provisions of John Damascene are used. Overcoming the modern at the "end of history" is a return to Christianity cleared of "diffusion" with paganism. This return is seen in the phenomenon of mass culture. Mass culture is "unspiritual" in the New European sense of the term, which means that there is no opposition between the spiritual and the physical. In the movement towards the spiritual which mass culture demonstrates, the physical is not denied but "sublated".

AB The article deals with the semantic specificity of the concept of action, the ascriptive and descriptive functions of action verbs, and how one can ascribe responsibility using these verbs by example of Herbert Hart's philosophy of action. Furthermore, some critical arguments against Hart's approach have been analyzed. The authors argue that this criticism does not defeat Hart's main idea that the denial of the physical and psychological components of action allows to conclude that, firstly, the concept of action is a social concept and logically dependent on the accepted rules of conduct; secondly, it is fundamentally not descriptive, but ascriptive in character; and, thirdly, it is a defeasible concept to be defined through exceptions and not by a set of necessary and sufficient conditions, be they physical or psychological.

DE education; fashion style; habitual profile; symbolic capital
AB The article reveals the methodological importance of the principle of habituality for understanding modern education within social theory and subject analytics. The question about genealogy and transformations of fashion identity and subjectivity at the intersection of philosophy of fashion and philosophy of education is raised. The habitualization strategy of their constituting is discussed. It is shown that the development of education from the era of modernity contributes to the growth of the symbolic social capital and reveals the activity character of any educational practice as - initially cultural and social, consistently integrated into the existing system of social values. A person who is focused on the success in the labor market is able to achieve it in two opposite ways. The first market strategy is to choose an educational path and to use its final product (acquired knowledge) in such a way as to fit perfectly into the already existing order of the social division of labor. The second strategy aims to break the existing configuration of the social and professional sphere, to supplement new professional and competence positions that can compete with the existing ones. The first of the described modus operandi represents a kind of a "habitual education profile" which repeats the classical formulation of the question about the actor of educational practice and continues to be reproduced. The fashion style, or the habitual "fashion profile", with which it should be correlated from the point of view of the subjective ordering of the social world, inculcated in the corresponding "subjective mood", is very reminiscent of the yuppie fashion culture. In contrast, a completely different combination of subjective inclinations and habits, ways to act in the nearby segments of the social field (economic/political/educational) is demonstrated by the hipster fashion culture.

DE Constitution of Russian Federation; Basic Law; constitutional theory
AB The aim of the study is the analysis of the transformation of the meaning of the term "constitution" over time. In the course of it, the views of authors of different periods are considered, and a final definition, which can become suitable for the modern science of constitutional law, is proposed. The study is based on the theoretical material, which includes the works of V.F. Zalesky, A.V. Daisi, B.N. Chicherin, C. Borzho, G. Jellinek, G. Kelzen, F. Lassalle, N.I. Palienko, M.A. Reisner, A.I. Elistratov, V.N. Durdenevsky, V.K. Dyablo, V.I. Lenin, N.P. Farberov, A.N. Kokotov, O.E. Kutafin, V.E. Chirkin, N.S. Bondar, V.V. Nevinsky, T.Ya. Khabrieva and other prominent scholars, as well as the materials of the RF Constitutional Commission and the RF Constitutional Assembly. The methodological basis of the research is dialectical, historical and legal methods. In particular, the use of the dialectical method contributed to the study of the term "constitution" in its formation and development. The use of the historical and legal method helped to substantiate the historical significance of securing the term of the Constitution of the Russian Federation in the modern constitutional law of Russia. The author analyzes Russian and foreign doctrines, and outlines the main trends in the definition of the concept "constitution" that took shape in the pre-revolutionary, revolutionary, Soviet period and when discussing drafts of the Basic Law of the Russian Federation. On the basis of the foregoing, the researcher developed his own approach to the modern term "The Constitution of the Russian Federation". It is noted that in the development of the constitutional and legal thought, the content of the basic laws of states also changed, provisions on human rights and citizens were added. As a result, the author came to a conclusion that the science of pre-revolutionary, revolutionary and Soviet state law, despite the absence of appropriate constitutional templates, prepared a theoretical basis for defining the concept of the Constitution of Russia; this material was also relevant in the development of a new Russian constitution, which is confirmed in the materials of the RF Constitutional Commission and the RF Constitutional Assembly. The author believes that the unity of the state and social system generates not only the constitutional order, but also determines the direct interaction of the state and civil society, which is permanent, stable and systematic. In this regard, it is proposed to understand the Constitution of the Russian Federation as the legal superstructure of the life of the state and society; the basis of the legal field of the home state; the Basic Law, which establishes fundamental social relations, the basis of the legal status of man and citizen, the federal structure, the organization of state power and local self-government; a political and legal act which is based on the values of the state and society, having a programmatic character.

AB This article first compares Richard Florida's theory of the creative class and Guy Standing's theory of the precariat. Attention is focused on the inconsistency of the grounds for social stratification in these theories. Their authors consider different, but interrelated processes of transformation of the sphere of labor. As a result of the synthesis of the social structure models, a social group was identified that corresponds simultaneously to both the precariat and the creative class. This social group, the creative precariat, is formed as a result of the internal segmentation of creative industries and the intensification of social and economic instability. The approach to its consideration existing in the scientific literature does not allow taking into account the dynamics of interprofessional stratification processes. The criticism of this approach convicting the creative precariat in the context of Florida's and Standing's theories needs analysis. On the basis of these theories synthesis, the specifics of the processes of the inclusion of creative industry workers in the new social group are revealed.

AB In the article, the author criticizes the thesis by Alexander Nikiforov on the role of modern science in the contemporary world. The author's first claim consists in denying Nikiforov's contradistinction between "science as search for truth" and "science as technological development". First of all, this contradistinction leads towards a false hierarchy of disciplines whose subject of investigation is science, i.e. philosophy of science, history of science, sociology of knowledge, etc. By defining the "true nature and purpose" of science as technological development, Nikiforov either rejects or oppresses other definitions and ways of investigation, the philosophical one included. Further, this contradistinction does not take into account the fact that fundamental scientific theories have existed and still exist without a necessary development of technologies, so it can hardly be said that science per se is just a way to make gadgets for satisfying human needs. Though the simplicity of this dualistic approach may seem to be quite appealing, its theoretical benefits (especially for epistemology) are questionable. The development of fundamental science and the so-called "technoscience" are the results of a single process, i.e. general scientific development. That is why they cannot be considered as two opposite phenomena. The author's second claim covers the lack of Nikiforov's attention to the contribution by social sciences and the humanities to science in general: these disciplines do not create any technologies in the sense of tools or gadgets, but their development successfully influenced societies in their political structure, social policies and civil rights, especially in the First World countries. Then the author argues that some concepts by Nikiforov like "biological needs" or "spirituality" are opaque and their link to scientific development is groundless. Finally, the author claims that the very answer to the initial question on the moral value of science is incorrect, because it is based on the substitution of the thesis.

DE Hamann; Enlightenment; Socrates; axiology; metaschematism
AB The paper analyses the social-political ramifications of Johann Georg Hamann's 1759 debut treatise Socratic Memorabilia, in which he challenges the cultural and ideological expansion of the ideas of the French Enlightenment in Prussia. Using his own "metaschematism" method, Hamann takes the role of a Socrates of his own time and criticises the policy of enlightened absolutism of Frederick the Great. He poses an axiological alternative to his addressees Immanuel Kant and Johann Christoph Berens: serving the truth irrespective of the consequences or conscientious pleasing those in authority under the slogan of enlightening the public. Hamann rejects the labour ethic of the Enlightenment, which praised even hard and meaningless labour for the sake of the flourishing of society. Instead, he proposes the concept of "leisure" (Lange Weile), which allows him to preserve the freedom of creativity. Hamann attempts to destroy the concept of the public as a societal ideal by viewing it as an abstraction that does not have a referent in the real world. Being a widely spread practice in the Enlightenment context, an attempt to please the public would conceal the fact that it is the elite (and not specific people hidden behind the terminology of the "public" who are being exploited) that becomes the beneficiary of such activities. According to Hamann, a philosopher who views his calling highly will not necessarily count on wide recognition by society, but must be ready to be misunderstood and lead a life full of hardships.

DE mental representations; computability; intentionality; classical model
AB The paper is devoted to Jerry Fodor's classical computational theory of mind. Fodor is one of the brightest proponents of the theory, the one who developed it during almost all his research career. The paper discusses the major features of classical computationalism which starts from the Turing idea. The classical approach describes the mind as an independent program level. There is no great necessity in the knowledge of brain neurobiology, because we can describe the mind as an autonomous level, equal to the program level of the computer. The main point of the computational theory of mind is that the brain is a real analog of the computer, and the mind is a real analog of the program level: it is not a system which we could only describe as a set of programs, but a system which lacks the corresponding ontological status. The main feature of the work of this level is that syntactically driven computations are made over the mind's symbols - concepts. Computations are independent of the meaning of concepts; and the only thing the system should 'know' is the formal rules which govern the behaviour of concepts. The major advantage of a classical approach is that it could explain intentionality via causal links between objects in the world and symbols in the mind. It is shown that this explanation of intentionality can block John Searle's well-known Chinese Room argument. One of the strongest sides of a classical model is that it could explain intentionality, on the one hand, without appealing to biology terms and, on the other hand, without relativising or eliminating it. Another advantage of computationalism is that it uses such notions as mental states and understands mental states as representations. Of course, the computational theory of mind lost many of its proponents just because of the rising of opposing models - connectionism, for instance. And there has always been a strong eliminativism movement in philosophy of mind which finds additional power within connectionism, but classical computationalism has its own advantages because it saves and uses the notion of mental representations and intentionality and comports with our common-sense view.

AB In this paper, the author analyses some methods for weakening the universality of the Hilbert-Bernays derivability conditions associated with the application of modal logic to the theory of proof, in particular, in the proof of Godel's second incompleteness theorem. The phenomenon of intensional non-equivalence of combinations of modal operators is considered as an explanation of the intensional character of Godel's second theorem. It is shown that the cause of the appearance of deviant concepts of consistency of a formal system is the ambiguous translation of informal mathematical concepts into a formal presentation, as well as the effects of translation of formal theories with different signatures from one to another.

DE passive euthanasia; practical argumentation; Plato; Aristotle;
   Hippocrates
AB To treat or not to treat hopelessly ill patients? Not to treat, Plato answers in The Republic, since for this decision it is sufficient that the doctor knows his patient as incurable. To treat, says Aristotle in The Rhetoric, since for this decision it is sufficient that the doctor knows of the possibility to return his patient's health. The authors show that these Plato's and Aristotle's explicit answers reflect their positions only partly, and under certain conditions they imply the opposite answers, too. The authors discuss the issue of passive euthanasia as the doctor's refusal to treat hopelessly ill patients from two angles: from the viewpoint of this practice in ancient societies, and from that of practical argumentation regarding actions by means of which the decisions over patients' euthanasia are justified. As concerns euthanasia practices, there are three features characterizing ancient societies: such decisions rest on the epistemic grounds, they employ a paternalistic approach to doctor-patient relations and a functional view on what health is. Therefore, the goal of medical treatment is solely the return of health, and no palliative care corresponds to it; it is his knowledge that enables the doctor to euthanize, and no patient's consent is required. In its full-fledged form, Plato's answer is: not to treat, if and only if the doctor knows about the incurable condition of the patient, and to treat if the doctor knows that the patient can be cured. Since the conclusions in practical arguments are plausible and defeasible, they amplify the rigid framework of the dichotomy in Plato's argument "from virtue" which erects doctor's knowledge to a professional virtue understood as his contribution to the well-being of society performed by treating those who deserve that and refusing to do so with those hopelessly ill. Doctor's knowledge is essential in Aristotle's argument "from patient", according to which a hopelessly ill patient has to be treated if and only if the doctor considers his treatment possible, and not treated if he thinks otherwise. The doctor determines the possibility of treatment with the help of a practical syllogism, outlined by Aristotle in The Nicomachean Ethics. In this reasoning the doctor determines a line of conduct with respect to the goal of returning health to his patient, and he has to refrain from treating the patient if no such line can be determined.

DE J. Locke; ideas about miracles; Western historians of philosophy
AB The article reveals the characteristic features of the understanding by contemporary Western researchers of the ideas of J. Locke about miracles. Numerous scientific materials are analyzed in detail. The problem field of the understanding of the ideas of Locke about miracles is reconstructed. The years of publication of Locke's works that the researchers used are mentioned. The references of the researchers to the analyzed fragments of these works are checked and listed. In the first part of the article, the works of R.M. Burns, M.R. Ayers, R.J. Berry, M.S. Rabieh, J.J. MacIntosh, N. Wolterstorff, G. Brykman are analyzed. In the second part, the works of J. I. Israel, T.B. Mooney and A. Imbrosciano, V. Nuovo, M. Losonsky, A.L. Herold are analyzed. In conclusion, the following derivations are made. Firstly, it cannot be said that the understanding by contemporary Western researchers of the ideas of Locke about miracles is systematic. More often it is produced in the context of the study of any aspects of Locke's religious-philosophical and related ideas. Secondly, in spite of this, contemporary Western historical-philosophical literature addresses all the basic problems of Locke's reflections about miracles in varying degrees: (1) the epistemology of miracles, (2) the meaning of Christ's miracles, (3) the definition of a miracle, (4) genuine and false miracles. This is due to the fact that when describing and understanding Locke's ideas about miracles, the researchers turn (separately and in various combinations) to the materials of all sources most significant from the point of view of the topic under consideration. However, again, it cannot be said that all of Locke's ideas about miracles have been studied systematically and thoroughly. Thirdly, herewith, the researchers make an accent on the interpretation of some of Locke's ideas illustrating his (indeed, substantial) contribution to the formulation of the ideas related to the justification of faith in miracles that confirm the divine revelation, as well as the divinity of Christ. Nevertheless, which is especially important, the questions of the ambivalence of Locke's ideas about miracles are quite often raised in contemporary Western historical-philosophical literature.

ID MODEL; NEED
AB For a long time, pain, like other issues related to the corporeality of a person, was beyond the sphere of sociological interest. Since the second half of the 20th century, the situation has been changing, and the established models of the "disembodied" actor have been gradually denied. It is still too early to claim that sociology of pain is an established domain of research, but Mark Zborowski's People in Pain (1969) made a substantive contribution into studying pain as a complex phenomenon embracing physiological as well as psychological, cognitive and social aspects. Despite the methodological and conceptual differences, sociological approaches to the study of pain share a common feature that is a protest against the reductionist, unidimensional approach to pain that obtained a dominant position in the scientific discourse due to medical influence. Sociologists highlight that pain is always subjective, while medical representatives, being the main source of a "valid" knowledge of pain, are inclined to leave this subjectivity beyond their analysis. The article examines how the attitude towards pain in medicine has changed with time in order to understand what the prerequisites for the appearance of pain issues in the focus of sociological analysis were. The achievements of medicine promoted the transition from treating pain as an independent entity, conceptualised in terms of the mythological, the supernatural, to considering it only as a concomitant sign of physiological damage, without any independent value. The development of medical technologies has made it possible to proceed to such methods of diagnosing, in which patient's complaints become irrelevant, and it is possible to reach the disease "directly" without resorting to subjective factors. This reduction of personality to an organism as a mechanism that went out of order caused a certain protest from sociologists and promoted the increased interest in studying such issues. Meanwhile, at the moment in medical science too there have been significant shifts in the study of pain: first, it regained its independent status, which was reflected in the formation of a specific domain of pain studies and the creation of a specialised international association, and, second, an evidence base was accumulated that confirms that the relationship between the pain stimulus and pain as such is far from unambiguous and depends on many factors, including social ones.

DE cultural environment; sociocultural habitat; threats; risk; social

AB The vulnerability of a sociocultural locus in three groups of factors - natural, anthropogenic and technogenic - predetermines habitat degradation under their unregulated influence. The habitat considerably loses its historical and cultural uniqueness, but risk escalation connected with the destruction of the visual shape of cultural and historical landscapes can negatively influence the identity of people living in these territories. Owing to the compatibility with the riskogenic environment the consciousness, emotional condition and behaviour of people change. Risks become social, they are accumulated when people design their own social reality and are concretised in ideas of it, influencing not only the perception of external environment, but people's life. The analysis of the connection was carried out on the basis of the data of expert and mass polls in regions with the maximum and minimum levels of environmental and technology-related risks that have an impact on the sociocultural subenvironment locus. The threats experts noted - the destruction of historical and cultural objects, historically developed cultural infrastructure and the basic foundations of national identity - are reflected on by the population in a different way. Due to the assessment of the level of life stability, satisfaction with life conditions, assessment of the social atmosphere in the region, the perception of the environment as riskogenic is not the same in different age groups. There is a raised reflection on threats connected with cultural monuments demolition, losses of historical memory, cultural traditions, ethical standards destruction, feelings of uncertainty and risk. A decrease in satisfaction with life conditions happens, to a great extent, under the influence of historical monuments demolition. Deterioration of the cultural atmosphere in the region and, in this regard, growth of social tension in the regions correlate with the demolition of cultural monuments, loss of historical memory, destruction of moral values. Herewith, the analysed threats ambiguously impact the social feeling of the youth with their greatest optimism towards social reality as well as the modern approach to the preservation of historical and cultural heritage which combines protection of material objects of culture with the updating of cultural traditions and moral standards.

DT Article
DE State; USA; standoff between federal government and society; President;
   individualism; egalitarianism; etatism; Founding Fathers; social state;
   "limited" state
AB Why do not American people like their government? What does it mean? How Donald Trump happened to come up on the U.S. political stage, and does it stem from the general discontent of the people? To answer these questions, the authors of the article turn to intellectual origins of the American state, namely to the concepts of individualism, egalitarianism and etatism. Basically, when one says that Americans dislike their government, one means that people are dissatisfied either with the fact that there is too much government in their everyday lives or, vice versa, that their government cannot protect them, and its engagement is not enough. The authors explore prominent works of such thinkers as T. Hobbs, A. Hamilton, J. Madison, J. Jay, T. Pain, etc. to understand why American Founding Fathers have created such a system of checks and balances - to protect the people from the government or to protect the government itself from decay and degradation to the mob rule? How did they come up with the idea of Republic, and could they imagine to which extent the Federal government would broaden its authority only 100 years later? Starting from abolition of slavery, and later, the Great Depression established the course on the Welfare State building, and the Federal Government staff has grown up to three million people, broadening its capabilities by creating new Federal institutes. Since then, the power of the Federal Government has never come to the level the Founding Fathers designed it. Such a trend has spiraled into a situation when a part of the American electorate is always dissatisfied that they have to pay too much of taxes, go to wars, sponsor other countries' safety programs and help to build democracy abroad, so to say, that the State is regulating too many aspects of their lives, whereas the other part of nation feels not protected enough, first and foremost, economically. During the last 15 years, that dissatisfaction has been growing so dramatically, that American people who brought B. Obama to the White House with great expectations for changes, turned to be disillusioned and chose D. Trump, hoping that a non-politician will be able to break the pattern. People are very tired of the Government which lives torn from the society and its needs, which has turned the sacred election process into a show "with dirty laundry". The whole "Russian intrusion" hysteria as well as numerous social protests that have been shaking the United States since Trump has come into power, are now aimed at one thing - blocking the normal working process in the Government. And the Democrats who are in charge of all this, together with some Republicans, who cannot bear D. Trump's leadership style, will sooner or later also face the need to make a compromise with their electorate. Will people accept the new conditions, or will they prefer to get rid of the State itself? It is an open question, because that is how America was designed by the Founding Fathers.

AB This paper dwells upon the reasons for far-reaching Euroscepticism among EU citizens in order to explain and forecast public sentiment in the European Union. As more and more politicians call for the withdrawal from the EU, especially after the British referendum in 2016, demand for analytical methods to explain the attractiveness of such ideas increases. The article presents a comprehensive mathematical model explaining Eurosceptic sentiments among EU citizens, which allows to reduce costs of further research of this phenomenon. The quantitative method of structural equation modeling proves the validity of a model including factors related to (dis-) satisfaction of citizens' needs of citizens, perception of specific EU characteristics, and the general (mis-) understanding of EU politics. The model has proved to be instrumental to forecast Euroscepticism appeal through application of Eurobarometer public opinion polls of May 2017. The discrepancy between proportions of forecasted values and citizens' real answers does not exceed 6% in each of the EU member states.

DT Article
DE national memory; symbolic mediation; Russia; Ukraine; mnemonic standoff;

AB J. Verch from Washington university in Sant-Luiz (USA), in an attempt to define the substance of contradictions around Ukraine, finds out that they are much deeper than it is often presented. He explores correlation of political discourse and "symbols of national communities" in international attitude and in Russian-Ukrainian conflict. The author does not give a comprehensive answer. However, the publication of his paper in the Russian journal "Historical examination" is an endeavor to look beyond the narrative. Analysis of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is frequently focused on the elites' confrontation. As a result, the views of politicians and public opinion are artificially associated with symbols of national communities and an adequate analysis of perceptions suffers. Unless it is rectified, the settlement of one of the most dangerous conflicts in Europe is problematic. The author concludes that "memory wars" are highly counterproductive and it is an imperative to shift the discourse from political to academic dimension.

TI THE PERESTROIKA IN THE "HUMAN DIMENSION": THE ACTIVITIES OF MINISTER
   V.I. CHERNOIVANOV IN DEFENCE OF AGRARIAN SCIENCE
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE V.I. Chernoivanov; perestroika; agrarian science; research and
   production integration; the USSR
AB The article deals with the activities of V.I. Chernoivanov, the minister of agriculture and food of the USSR, who defended agrarian science at the final stage of the perestroika. The primitive-market views of the initiators of the perestroika on the problems of research and production integration in agriculture had the effect of worsening the situation both directly in science and in scientific and production structures. The shift of the focus in financing the science towards market mechanisms in the face of the increasing economic entropy created the danger of destroying the scientific potential. At the same time, the unjustified reorganisation of scientific and innovative structures significantly limited their opportunities. V.I. Chernoivanov as a scientist who headed the agrarian ministry actively resisted the destructive tendencies. He demanded an increase in the budgetary funding of science from higher authorities, proposed measures to improve the material and technical supply and staffing of scientific and production structures (sectoral pavilions of the Exhibition of Achievements of the National Economy, educational and experimental farms of universities, research production and production systems), considered it necessary to abandon the questionable reorganisation. In order to improve the financial position of institutions of science, to maintain the functioning of innovation departments, he repeatedly appealed to the top leaders of the country, including the president of the USSR, M.S. Gorbachev. As a rule, these appeals remained unanswered. Participating in the discussion of the draft of the new union treaty, V.I. Chernoivanov strove to ensure the preservation of the "single scientific and technical space", the structural and scientific ties between the republics of the "renewed" Union, which was in the interests of science; he opposed the destructive processes in relations linked by the historical destiny of the peoples. The situation was complicated by the confrontation between the two centres of power - the Union and the alternative Russian. In the author's opinion, the top management structures of the USSR and the RSFSR, absorbed in the struggle for power, were not interested in the scientific support of agriculture, their attention to science was purely situational in nature, it was determined by political opportunistic considerations. Therefore, the selfless work of the last soviet agrarian minister V.I. Chernoivanov, as a rule, did not lead to the desired results.

TI TOMSK SCIENTISTS - STALIN PRIZE WINNERS IN THE FIELD OF SCIENCE FOR
   THEIR ACHIEVEMENTS DURING THE GREAT PATRIOTIC WAR (1941-1945)
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL

DT Article
DE Stalin Prize; Tomsk; scientific community; Great Patriotic War
AB In the article, on the materials of official documents, periodicals and personal sources, the achievements of Tomsk scientists in the field of science during the Great Patriotic War that were marked with the Stalin Prize are considered. The perception of this award and its criticism for conjuncture and prejudice in the selection of winners are highlighted. Nevertheless, there was a high symbolic significance of the Stalin Prize. It was the highest form of national recognition for the soviet scientists during the modernisation and the "scientific Renaissance" of the 1930s-1940s, and it was the litmus test of scientific progress in the USSR. From 1942 to 1950, 14 scientists of Tomsk, some of whom were in this city in evacuation, were awarded the Stalin Prize for research achievements during the Great Patriotic War. Eight scientists (physicists V.D. Kuznetsov, M.A. Bolshanina, chemist L.P. Kulev, surgeon A.G. Savinykh, specialist in locomotive construction S.P. Syromyatnikov, histologist A. A. Zavarzin, geologist K.V. Radugin, specialist in mining N.A. Chynacal) in 1942 and 1943, and six scientists were awarded during the postwar years (surgeon D.A. Zhdanov, physiologist B.I. Bayandurov, pharmacologist N.I. Vershinin, botanist V.V. Reverdatto, therapist D.D. Yablokov, biologist B.P. Tokin). Their activities were integrated into the strategic directions chosen and coordinated by the Tomsk Committee of Scientists: research and development of medicinal raw materials, mineral deposits in Siberia, organisation of consultations and scientific support of industrial enterprises, solution to the "Ural-Kuzbass" problem, etc. The scientific context of the discoveries and works that were awarded and their practical application (introduction into industry, medical practice, transport, etc.) are analysed. The perception of these achievements by other scientists, the "large" scientific community, including international recognition, is reflected. The influence of political aspects on the selection of winners is considered. It is concluded that the Stalin Prize in the field of science during the period under review representatively reflected the main achievements of scientists, and it was a marker of research development, including on a regional scale. It is emphasised that, taking into account the impressive monetary value of this award and the privileges accompanying the title, the Stalin Prize was an important part of the "symbolic capital" of the soviet scientist during the Stalin era.

DT Article
DE India; disparities of development; disintegration of economy;
   "dualistic" economic growth; caste system; economic geography;
   "stationary" type of development; "isolated" type of development; SAARC;
   South Asia
AB With India taken as a case-study, the author gives special attention to the "polarized" type of development (disintegration of national economy), which affects the economic potential of the state. India, like many other transitional societies, is still at the middle stages of market-governed development and is still to resolve the controversy between economic growth and social equity. In such cases, "free market" is not in a position to find the optimal balance between initiative and intervention. According to the present writer, economic parameters per se cannot be treated as a yardstick for trajectory of development. Disparities in interregional development tend to be more articulated under rapid economic growth. The global recession of the 2010s has made a task of instituting a balanced socio-economic development even harder to attain. Across the terrain of subcontinental landmass, two basic types of socio-economic development are singled out: number one-stationary (the most populous states of India), and number two-isolated (the Northeastern states) due to geographic "separation" from the "mainland" India. The states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar accounting for a quarter of India's population, suffer from poor infrastructure for development and need a "blitzkrieg" of investment in power, roads and agriculture to generate economic growth. Lack of investments will make it more difficult to achieve and sustain a high rate of growth in the years to come. The political context of development in the "superlarge" states is aggravated by erosion of the Hindu United Family, on the one hand, and by synchronous pressures of rising social aspirations and stagnant or slow-growing incomes, on the other. Northeast India, a diverse region comprising eight states, is connected with "mainland" India by a passage less than 29 kms wide. The region lost connectivity and market access as a result of the Partition in 1947. The connectivity loss is instrumental for sluggish development of India's North East that has now fallen behind other states and territories of the country. Given the geographical proximity of the area to South East Asia, economic cooperation may accelerate growth in India's North East. Nonetheless, blending of domestic policy with foreign policy has not yet attained desired economic results. India is undergoing not only an economic but also a political change. The future of the country is ultimately dependent on harmonizing interests of winners and losers of development. In terms of political economy, both types of development are to be encouraged by targeted investments to overcome "stationary equilibrium". According to the author, India's (existent) investment potential is not adequate to stimulate economic growth. One of the "hidden" resources for rapid growth and advanced geoeconomic potential is tentative investment cooperation with foreign countries, including Russia.

TI HISTORIOGRAPHY OF ALEXANDER BOGDANOV'S SCIENTIFIC WORKS
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE historiography; history of science; scientific work of Alexander
   Bogdanov; tectological system analysis
AB This article contains analysis of Alexander Alexandrovich Bogdanov's (1873-1928) scientific works historiography and allocates the main directions of his scientific heritage study. The first stage of this study, the period of the 1930s-1950s, is characterized with the Marxist-Leninist ideology domination. Back then Bogdanov's works were interpreted only according to Georgy Plekhanov's and Vladimir Lenin's polemical texts, and it was the reason why the tectological system analysis method created by Bogdanov was defined only as an anti-Marxist philosophical doctrine. Some changes took place in the 1960s-1990s, when the main attention of historians was focused on Bogdanov's practical research in the sphere of medicine and system analysis. The main methodological features of the latest historical research are also characterized in this article: 1) the field of research is consciously narrowed to one-two aspects of Bogdanov's activity, which are studied in a profound detail; 2) the analysis of Bogdanov's works is rigidly associated with a specific area of knowledge: economics, sociology, political science, medicine, public administration, etc., and his tectological system analysis method is groundlessly attributed to philosophy; 3) scientific works of Bogdanov are corresponded with the modern situation in the respective areas of theoretical and practical knowledge, and are analyzed without any connection with the real level of science development in the time of Bogdanov's life. It should be especially noted that historians in the 2000s-2010s preserved the aspiration to interpret Bogdanov's developments as philosophical "discourse" only; it is also necessary to estimate the heuristic potential of a similar interpretation as low because it leads to the replacement of Bogdanov's system research analysis by a significantly less productive procedure of comparison of Bogdanov's opinion with opinions of other historical persons who lived at the turn of the 20th century. An alternative for a "discursive" interpretation of Bogdanov's scientific heritage is the integration of the tectological system analysis method with the research of the historical process and, respectively, the correlation of all "discursive" interpretations not only with each other but with the main forms of social, economic, political and scientific practice reconstructed according to primary sources, too. This methodological approach will allow to disprove a widespread conception of history as a "collection of subjective judgments about events of the Past" and will allow to restore the status of historical science as exact knowledge about the system of cause-effect relations between accurately established facts.

DE European Court of Human Rights; Council of Europe; pilot judgment
   procedure; structural (systemic) problems; implementation; general

AB The article examines the issues related to the influence of the procedure of pilot judgments of the ECtHR on the improvement of the legal systems of the Respondent States. A brief overview of some of the pilot actions taken in respect of the Respondent States is made; the effectiveness of the adopted measures of a general nature is assessed. The purpose of pilot judgments is the desire of the European Court and of all bodies of the Council of Europe involved in the procedure of pilot judgments at different stages to create a system of effective remedies at the national level, since a large part of duplicate cases confirms this necessity. The author emphasizes that the European Court should exercise special care and diligence in the indication of general measures in a pilot decision, as these measures conform with the constitutional principles of the Respondent State, historical and political-legal traditions and possibilities of the state budget. A conclusion is justified that the pilot judgment procedure should be applied only in exceptional cases, when there is an opportunity to find means to solve the problem at the national level. The methodological basis of the research consists of general scientific methods of cognition: dialectical, logical, systemic, functional, etc. Methods used in the science of international law were applied: system-legal, comparative legal, and method of interpretation of law. The latter was especially needed in addressing issues of a legal nature and specifics of the proposed pilot judgments of the European Court of Human Rights. The transformation of national legal systems, often associated with changes of value and mental approaches in a natural way, can not happen in a short period of time and require continuous and progressive work of national authorities on solving systemic problems. According to the author, the practice of making pilot judgments plays an important role in establishing the uniformity of the procedure and allows using the experience of states in overcoming systemic problems. Exchange of experience in addressing complex structural problems between the states and with the Council of Europe bodies greatly accelerates and improves the quality of pilot judgments execution. For a successful improvement of the legal systems, the member states of the Convention must have a set of legal, institutional and financial mechanisms that determine the productivity of the pilot judgment procedure. The effectiveness of the implementation of most pilot judgments can be considered satisfactory and in some cases, when overcoming the challenges of the post-Communist system, positive enable the Court to harmonize and unify the common legal space of the Council of Europe. However, to fully implement most of the measures taken by the Respondent States require constant monitoring of the state of legislation, the improvement of certain aspects of legal practice and, equally important, the timely and sufficient allocation of the necessary budget funds to award compensation.

AB This article is devoted to the study of Islamic factor's role in political processes of the Republic of Tatarstan. Today, the influence of the Islamic factor on republic's political process is determined through the political participation of the Spiritual Administration of Muslims of the Republic of Tatarstan. This organization conducts a dialogue with the republican authorities on behalf of the entire community and is an intermediary between it and the state. The political participation of Muslim organizations of the republic is limited by secular regional and federal legislation. Spiritual Administration, having no legal possibility to exert direct influence on the political processes of the region, makes efforts for indirect influence. The organization accumulates its political capital by concentrating non-political resources in its hands, or rather by influencing the legislative process in the republic and introducing the Islamic factor into the economic, social, educational, information and other spheres of public life. However, the influence is fragmentary, which is facilitated by many reasons: lack of financial independence, control by secular authorities, lack of cohesion of the regional ummah, etc. Today, the Spiritual Administration of Muslims of the Republic of Tatarstan is characterized by a loyal attitude to secular authorities and the purpose of its political participation is not the replacement of political power in the region, but the solution of such problems as: strengthening of morality on the basis of Islamic values, preservation the ethnic identity of the Tatars, the revival of Islam in Russia, preservation and strengthening of traditional Islam, as a condition for effective opposition to Islamic extremism. The influence of the Spiritual Administration of Muslims of the Republic of Tatarstan on the regional political process will grow as the Islamic factor in international politics becomes more actual, the political activity of the Muslims of the North Caucasus intensifies, the Muslim infrastructure in the republic spreads and the radical Islam gradually enters the political space of the region.

DE diversification; additional vocational education; modernization; social
   worker; professional standards
AB The authors substantiate in the article the urgency of modernizing the system of additional vocational education for social workers. Diversification of education is one of the ways to solve this problem; diversification of education provides a new vector of the development of the system: its flexibility, accessibility, the ability to respond promptly to any changes in the social sphere. Diversification is the principle of innovative structuring of the system of additional vocational education, providing the possibility of variability in educational services and programs, forms, types, technologies of instruction. The authors demonstrate the mechanisms for implementing diversification processes in the context of additional professional education for social workers. The globalization of information technology, the socio-economic transformation of Russian society, the problems of its development require a rethinking of the quality of education that meets national interests, goals and strategies for progress. The problem of improving the quality of education has received a special sound today in connection with the actualization of the task of innovative education, which could provide training for specialists capable of carrying out innovative activities in all spheres of society. The introduction of professional standards of specialists in the social sphere, independent evaluation of qualifications against the backdrop of socioeconomic changes in modern Russia make new demands on the professional level of social workers and the availability of professional competences. The social worker of the new formation must possess a whole range of professional knowledge, skills and skills in the field of social work, innovative technologies of social services for the population, be financially and legally competent, and be sociable, tactful, diplomatic, empathetic, etc. [Lomakina 2001]. The current state of Russian education confirms the dependence of the structure and functioning of this social institution on the conditions of the socio-cultural and political environment. State policy and the management process in the field of education are closely related to modern Russian modernization processes that have revealed crisis phenomena in Russian society, affected virtually all spheres of public life, and have and continue to have a serious impact on the functioning of the main sociopolitical institutions.

DE identity; dynamics of identity; constructivism
AB The article is devoted to the analysis of factors of the dynamics of group identity. Identities are considered in the frame of theory of constructivism and structural-functional approach according which they presented as complicated system of identities divided into types, forms and modes of functioning. Three groups of factors affect on the dynamics of this system. First group of factors are identified as fundamental and they refer to the general conditions of functioning of identities. Second group of factors (particular) applies to the existence, functioning and transformation of communities which are the part of the general one and result from their interrelations. Third group of factors - topical - are the most inconstant and formed peculiarly from institutional-discursive structures of communities and society as a whole as well as from reaction of to this phenomenon of carriers of identity. It is necessary to analyze these three groups of factors altogether because each of them is identified through other and has an impact on each other. These three groups of factors can form several trends of dynamics of the system of identities. On a fundamental level stable and unstable state of the system can be distinguished. Unstable state of the system is divided into two types - "modernizational" and "archaizational". The differences between them is based on the directions of modification where first is widening of potential of the system and the second is its reduction. Similarly on the level of particular factors of the dynamics of the system some generalized types of them can be distinguished. Since on this level interrelations of communities are analyzed, the trends of this relations can be identified - integration, incorporation and separation. On topical level communities and its sub-groups can develop three options of state: self-reproduction in present conditions, dissatisfaction with own state and generating conflict towards other communities and society as a whole. As a whole sociocultural dynamics represent reluctant which made by totality of described factors and will express in both situations - in internal redistribution of attitudes of communities and in shifts of types of identities. This all in its turn will affect on changes of relations among the elements of the system of identities.

DE transnational identity; national identity; postmodern society;

AB The article discusses the problem of national identity formation and its alternatives in modern society. The actualization of postmodern paradigm in studying the problems of identity is justified and theoretical and methodological foundations of investigating identification and its outcomes in postmodern society in the context of non-linear development are revealed. Identity formation in postmodern society becomes very changeable, this process is implemented in various identity patterns. Post-modernity is characterized by lack of structural properties, decentration and plurality; identity is thus viewed within the framework of the contemporary socio-philosophical discourse in the light of singularity principles. Singularity, as viewed by J. Deleuze, is a dot meaning-producing event. The individual everyday life space is expanded, a single center of this space is lost, causing diffuseness and delocalization. These characteristics of contemporary man life space become particularly prominent in the circumstances of migration, which is becoming global and determining formation of transidentities. The process of identification in postmodern society is losing its former regularities. The birth of new identities is undergoing in the circumstances of constructive chaos and is characterized by fragmentation and contextuality. The problem of preserving national identity and forming transidentities in the conditions of transmigration is discussed by the author on the basis of materials of sociological survey, conducted by the author in April - May 2017, using qualitative approach and methods of deep interview, as well as a series of formalized interviews. Major informants were emigrants, which moved from Russia to the US, Western Europe, Israel, Canada and Australia in the post-Soviet period. The analysis of the data obtained made it possible to identify a number of tendencies, including weakening of national identity, its delocalization, the growth of importance of ethnic identity, the emergence of plurality of the concepts of Motherland, non-linear character and plurality of life scenarios. The implementation of these scenarios is based on singularity principles, objectified in biographical scenarios of transemigrants and the formation of new mentality.

   "Interviews on Physics"
AB On the material of archival documents, sources of personal origin and periodicals, the article covers the history of Interviews on Specific Issues of Physics and Related Branches of Knowledge (or a scientific seminar) held during 1918-1920 in Tomsk as one of episodes from the life of the Tomsk academic community in the difficult period of its history. They were organized by N.N. Semenov, the future full member of the USSR Academy of Sciences, a Nobel Laureate, and then a teaching assistant of the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics of Tomsk University. The socio-cultural space of Tomsk on the eve and during the Civil War is considered. At that time, hard financial and living conditions contrasted with the flourishing of cultural life in the scientific and educational complex of the city. This was due to the fact that in connection with the political events in the country, the evacuation of Perm and Kazan universities there was a high concentration of scientific forces at that time in Tomsk. This greatly intensified the educational and scientific life in the city, the most striking manifestation of which was the organization and activities of the Institute for the Study of Siberia (1919-1921). The events of N.N. Semenov's life preceding his appearance in this cultural center are traced. It is emphasized that he combined the duties of a university teaching assistant with the organizational educational and scientific activities. He started a physical circle and opened a student seminar, and in October 1918 organized the Interviews on Physics. They were public in nature; announcements about them were published in advance on the pages of local newspapers (Sibirskaya zhizn', Narodnaya Gazeta, Znamya revolyutsii). The thematic and problematic fields of the reports presented during the 40 Interviews are analyzed (they concerned not only different sections of physics, but also astronomy and mathematics), as well as the set of the lecturers. B.P. Weinberg, a professor of Tomsk Technological Institute and concurrently of Tomsk University, attended the Interviews. However, mostly young scientists, teachers and students of local universities took part in the Interviews. It is noted that among them there were four future academicians (N.N. Semenov, V.D. Kuznetsov, G.A. Shain, G.S. Landsberg) and 10 professors (L.N. Bogoyavlensky, V.M. Khrushchev, M.A. Velikanov, R.O. Kuzmin and others). It is concluded that the Interviews on Physics became a valuable organizational tool for scientific and disciplinary cultural exchange and one of the brightest episodes of the socio-cultural history of the academic community of Tomsk during the Civil War.

DE male; female; gender studies; postmetaphysical thinking
AB This article is devoted to the study of the specificity of conceptualization of the categories "male" and "female" in modern philosophy. In the article, modernity is seen as a unique combination of profound changes in the sphere of social life, the mechanisms of the functioning of public institutions, on the one hand, and fundamental mental schemes, on the other. Social metamorphoses of sex are one of the most acute issues of our time, and their emergence and dissemination correlates in the Western European tradition with the transformation of the ways of conceptualizing reality, deep thought patterns. In general, this transformation of the fundamental mental structures is commonly referred to in modern philosophy as the term "post-metaphysical thinking". The main feature of this type of thinking is the development of various strategies to overcome the traditional philosophical style, based on essentialism and dualism, operating binary oppositions. Discursive mobility, associated with the "melting" of the binary principle of the description of the world, society and man, is consonant with the change of reality itself, the transformation of the social order. In a special way this unique combination is revealed regarding the problematic of sex, which is a definite focus of metamorphosis. Obvious and irreversible mutations in the sphere of family and sexual relations seem to be accidental only in isolation from the context of profound metamorphosis in the ways of conceptualizing the world, society and man, as well as the changes in the ways of thematization of categories "male" and "female" that are closely intertwined with them. The study of the fundamental transformations of the ontological status of these categories in the context of changing philosophical paradigms can clarify the fundamental importance and the main meaning of those changes in the field of sex and sexual relations that cause so many questions and concerns on the part of both enlightened critics and ordinary contemporaries.

DE freedom; liberalism; antinomies
AB The article combines theoretical studies of the concept of freedom, the history of thought, and the study of the history of political activity aimed at the embodiment of the ideal of freedom. Relationship of the history of thought with the history of liberal and neoliberal practices determines the problem field of the article. The article aimed at problematic, debatable moments of understanding the idea of freedom, as well as difficulties and distortions of implementation practical politics. The personal aspect of the concept of freedom and its social meaning considered in the theoretical part of the article. Essential characteristics of freedom studied through analyzed its relationship with awareness and rationality. The problem of the choice, constructed from the outside of desires, raised in this work. The problem of predetermined solutions of the personality by the social environment, designated by M. Scheler, analyzed in the first part of the article. The study of the existentialists' approach to understanding human freedom in extreme situations and its relation to the fate complements the analysis and gives a holistic view of the theoretical development of the concept of freedom. The scientific novelty of the research is the disclosure of various essential understandings of the idea of freedom and its dynamic connection with political practice, which determines the various interpretational modes of the concept of freedom. The factor of contextual conditioning of the understanding of freedom investigated turning from the consideration of the interpretive modes to the consideration of the political realization of the concept of freedom and concrete situational conditions in the second section of the article. The article shows the following contradiction expressed in opposite understanding of freedom of various political movements, as well as the heterogeneity of positions and the inability to achieve a common understanding within the liberal movement. In addition, the article describes political intervention in the field of theory, as well as philosophical concepts and meanings adapt to justify political expediency.

AB The article analyzes personality of orientalist Mikhail Arkadievich Polumordvinov (1867, Saratov province - 1917, Tomsk), a military ethnographer and collector of Buddhism and culture of Asian peoples (China, Mongolia, Japan, Tibet, etc.). The basis for the study is the Mikhail Polumordvinov' Book Collection, which is located in the Tomsk State University scientific library, and other materials, stored in the Tomsk Regional Museum named after Mikhail Bonifatievich Shatilov, namely books, photographs and manuscripts with attribution of artefacts.
   The article tells about the content of the personal library of Mikhail Polumordvinov and the places where books were published with special attention to the Printing House of the Imperial Academy of Sciences, the Publishing House of the Eastern Institute, the Printing House of the Uspensky Monastery under the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission, the Tipo-lithography of the Zaamursky District Headquarters, the Russian-Chinese Printing House "Yuan-Dun-Bao", Electro-steam typo-lithography of the "Bergut and Son" Partnerships. Also, we consider Mikhail Polumordvinov's interest to books of certain content according to his military interests (in terms of duty) and cultural interests (Buddhism and the culture of Asia).
   Further analysis number of books published in different decades from the point of view of fashion to the East, which affected the publishing industry and the world exhibition movement, which, in turn, provided materials for research and procurement of Mikhail Polumordvinov.
   Further analysis themes of books of Mikhail Polumordvinov's collection on the regions, his priorities in the collection of publications and the reasons for these priorities are highlighted.
   The article also reveals the degree of prestige of Mikhail Polumordvinov among his colleagues and other orientalists of the Manchurian region; his belonging to the unspoken oriental scientific community as an authoritative specialist and considers his publishing and translating activities in the 30 OKEIC (Zaamursky District of the Border Guard).
   The result of this work is the opportunity to consider the personality of Mikhail Polumordvinov as an Orientalist, not a serviceman, and as an enthusiastic collector seeking to gather better information about his subjects. Also, the article will assess the scientific approach of Mikhail Polumordvinov to the collection of Buddhist art objects. Also, this article will allow to evaluate the scientific approach of Mikhail Polumordvinov to collection of objects of Buddhist art and his perception of Russia, the mainland and insular South-East Asia as a unified political and cultural region.

DE evolutionary-epistemology; epistemic-logic; non-normal-modal-logic
AB From the viewpoint of evolutionary epistemology, it is not perfect that the formula "If agent knows that q, then q" belongs to the set of theorems of epistemic logic calculi. Not formal defects of those calculi in which the formula is provable are meant but not-adequateness of such calculi from the philosophical content viewpoint is implied. It is suggested to exclude the mentioned formula from the set of theorems of epistemic logic in such a way that being not a theorem the formula is deductively derivable from an assumption. The assumption is precisely defined in this paper by means of such an axiomatic epistemology system to the set of theorems of which the following theorem belongs: "If agent knows that q, then, if agent a priori knows that q, then q". The axiomatic epistemology system precisely defined and exploited in this article synthesizes the rationalism (a-priori-ism) and the empiricism (a-posteriori-ism) philosophical doctrines consistently. Thus, the paper gives a precise axiomatic definition of exotic epistemic-modality-notions "agent a priori knows that q" and "agent a posteriori knows that q". In the conceptual opposition-square-and-hexagon submitted by the author, the mentioned exotic epistemic-modality-notions are not contradictory but contrary to each other. Generally speaking the axiomatic epistemology system under investigation is based upon not a normal modal logic as Godel's necessitation rule does not belong to this axiom system. Nevertheless, in the particular case (subsystem) of purely a priori knowledge Godel's rule is derivable. It is not derivable as a general rule of inference of the axiom system as a whole owing to that axiom which defines the epistemic modality "agent a posteriori knows that q". The heuristic power of the epistemology-axiom-system is exemplified by applying it to investigating logic aspect of the "epistemic paradox" formulated by G.E. Moore. The problem is divided into two parts and the parts are considered separately. The investigation results are the following. If it is implied that the knowledge in question is a priori one, then Moore sentence does entail a formal logic contradiction. A formal deductive proof of this statement is constructed within the epistemology-axiom-system under discussion. But if it is implied that the knowledge in question is empirical (a posteriori) one, then the so-called "paradox" of Moore does not entail a formal logic contradiction: the notorious sentence can be true.

DE nation; the historical memory; the temporal image of the country
AB The temporal representation of the country is studied in the article as an important element of the national civic identity. This representation is an awareness of the past, present and future of the country and identification with it. The temporal strategy of the nation is formed at the macro level of society and present oneself the prevailing structure of the past fixed in the minds of the citizens of the country. In this meaning can speak about the nations of the past, present and future. Russia in this logic is a nation of the past. In the mass consciousness of Russian society circulates mythological ideas about the past of Russia. The article attempts to investigate some of these images and representations. The empirical base of this article is the data obtained as a result of a questionnaire survey conducted in MarchApril 2015 and March-April 2017 among adult residents of Tyumen (aged 17 and over). The dimension of the representative selection in both measurements was 1600 respondents. In the process of data analysis, four age groups were identified based on a generational approach: the Soviet generation (born before 1972), the late Soviet generation (1973-1984), the post-Soviet transition generation (born in 1985-1993), the post-Soviet generation (1994-2000 years of birth). It can be stated the key tendency saved which identified in 2015. Firstly, the continuation of the line for the nationalization past of the country in the administrative-mobilization logic of a vertically integrated personalistic political regime. At the same time, there are obvious signs of a loss of its mobilizing power, a rise in the level of public consciousness of skepticism about this line because of its divergence from reality. Secondly, in the temporal construction of the representation of Russia, the priority of the past remains. However, in 2017, an increase in the degree of identification of respondents with the present of Russia and its future was recorded. This allows us to talk about the exhaustion of the energy of the past in the mobilization and consolidation policy, which is likely to result in its immediate change in the direction of increasing attention to the future, constructing the corresponding narrative "from above". Thirdly, the preservation of the conservative trend in the construction of a national narrative about the country's ideal past, both at the level of political discourse and at the level of mass representations of citizens. At the same time, conservative sentiments are more pronounced in young generation groups, which, in particular, is manifested in the assessment of the role of Soviet historical experience.

DE deviance; ontological insecurity; Jock Young; social control
ID SOCIOLOGY
AB The article discusses the viability of the sociology of deviance. Over the last few decades, the claim that this research specialty is dead has become increasingly vocal. The proponents of this idea suggest that the study of norm-violation in today's relativistic and pluralistic world is archaic and counterproductive. The paper assesses this argument by examining how the deviance is generated and managed under the conditions of late modernity. In these purposes, the theory of criminologist Jock Young is outlined. He took the concept of ontological insecurity from sociologist Anthony Giddens (1990), while the latter in his turn took it from psychiatrist Ronald Laing (1960). Young concludes that ontological insecurity is one of the key topics for understanding the nature of deviance in postfordist societies. On the one hand, the feelings of insecurity generate the request for the creation of rigid lines of demarcation between social groups. Effective tool of such borders management is othering, i.e. actions by which a member of a group becomes classified as "not one of us". Othering is based on the process of essentialization, i.e. attributing essential, natural characteristics to members of specific culturally defined groups. In addition, insecurity contributes to the development of the culture of control, including privatization and decentralization of social control practices (the rising private security sector and the increasing number of gated communities are the signs of it). On the other hand, feelings of insecurity are the sources of the deviant activities, including crime. Considering this, Young explores the phenomenon of expressive deviant actions, or voluntary risk taking activities in terms of Stephen Lyng, the author of the edgework theory. Thereby, examining the relationship between deviance and insecurity, J. Young creates the link between Robert Merton's strain theory and constructivist labeling approach. The paper concludes that deviance is one of the core elements of late modern society.

AB The purpose of the present piece of research is concerned with functional peculiarities identification of the category of evaluation as manifested in the Barack Obama election discourse. Present-day linguistics emphasizes the importance of such studies whose findings could be applicable not only in the process of linguistic analysis proper, but also in the related spheres of knowledge such as political science, political rhetoric, etc. Furthermore, taking into account the innate ability of a human-being to perform the so-called evaluative reasoning, it seems topical to consider how this reasoning is reflected in the political discourse of key political figures. Evaluation is treated as a heterogeneous phenomenon typical of human cognition and psychology. Evaluation constructs the ideological basis of a discourse as well as builds and maintains relationships between interactants. Evaluation in discourse is realized within three interacting domains of attitude, engagement, and graduation. The first one (attitude) is seen as of special interest within the scope of the present investigation.

ID PICTURES
AB The aim of this article is to display the constitutive features of analytic philosophy of depiction (APD), a research field barely represented in Russian scientific literature. While sharing some core methodological implications and stylistic patterns with other subdivisions of analytic philosophy, APD tends to form rather enclosed philosophical community with its distinctive theoretical "canon" and highly specialized set of research questions. Philosophers of depiction explore the concept of picture rather than more conventional and broadly understood 'image'. From this perspective pictures are defined as two-dimensional objects simultaneously possessing some material vehicle (plane, surface) and some visual representational content. Philosophical understanding of pictures usually presupposes reflecting on problems of how pictorial representation works and in which respect it differs from other representational systems, of how ontological duality of depiction may be explained and of how to discern the conditions and singularities of pictorial experience and basic pictorial understanding. Some of these questions were initially posed by philosophers of art, but APD has already obtained theoretical independence from aesthetics at the current stage of its development. The core APD accounts include illusion theory (E.H. Gombrich), structural theories (N. Goodman, J. Kulvicki), seeing-in and twofoldness theory (R. Wollheim), make-believe theory (K. Walton), recognitional theories (F. Schier, D.M. Lopes) and experienced resemblance theories (J. Hyman, R. Hopkins). It is shown that despite their radical discrepancies, they share core standards of argumentation along with tendency to provide "strong" but concise explanations of depiction-related problems as well as to introduce novel, unorthodox notions in order to make their conceptual apparatuses more specified, fine-grained and nuanced. The most original and somewhat idiosyncratic feature of APD is that it generally avoids preoccupations with historical, political or ideological implications of pictures and social conditions of their production, circulation and reception. Hence any further applications of APD's theoretical accomplishments have a strong need to be supported by comparisons with other directions of research concerning the pictorial and the visual (such as interdisciplinary image studies, visual studies, iconology etc.).

AB The article deals with a very interesting and original approach to a new understanding of the role of definition in legal science, developed by the representative of Scandinavian legal realism, Alf Ross. It is shown that the basis of Ross's theory is the orientation on social facts and the "empiristic postulate", which methodologically bring his approach to the empiricist tradition within the framework of analytical philosophy, especially with a logical empiricism of R. Carnap. Ross represents his main thesis that abstract legal terms have a meaning only in context. In addition to its main tenet, Ross's paper also contains a criticism of essentialism in a definition of legal terms and some comments on the relative importance of legal definitions in common law countries as compared with countries of codified law. The translation into Russian A. Ross "Definition in Legal Language" is presented in appendix.

DE political perception; image; country; media; communication
AB The article is devoted to the problem of forming the image of the country in the mass political consciousness and the role of the media in this process. Since the process of political perception is mediated by channels for obtaining information and communication, traditional and non-traditional Media largely determine both the communicative image and the image, which is then formed in the mass consciousness. That is why, in the context of informatization and globalization of the world geo-political space, psychological and communicative aspects must be taken into account when the state develops strategies for its behavior. The article considers the political-psychological and politico-communicative approaches to this issue. The author analyzes various views on the structural components of the image of the country. In particular: the image of the people, the image of power, national heroes, "friends", "enemies", political leader, as well as the image-knowledge, image-value and image of the future. All these elements of the image are considered from the point of view of the possibility of their formation with the help of the media. The main theories of political communication analyzed in the work allow us to consider the media as a factor in the formation of cognitive, emotional and behavioral components of the image of the country. The information, educational, propaganda functions of the QMS, as well as the function of forming public opinion, can significantly influence the process of political perception. This is due to the popularization of certain knowledge and facts about the object of perception, as well as the formation of stereotypes, social attitudes, values and needs. Media form the context of the perception of the country through the creation and popularization of information causes and the formation of the agenda, and also affect the objective and subjective factors of political perception. In other words, mass media can simultaneously be communicators and channels of information transfer, agents and institutions of education and socialization, as well as creators of a certain kind of stereotypes. The aspects of media activity described in the article can help the state in the formation of an information and image strategy.

TI SEMIOTIC APPROACH TO DEALING WITH THE KEY CONTRADICTIONS OF THE MODERN

DE edusemiotics; sign; system of education; integration; differentiation;
   interpretation
AB The author believes that there are contradictions in the education system due to the incongruity of the "big metaphor" of education, through the prism of which it is thought of by the representatives of state power and the majority of the researchers, and the real mission of education in the modern context. Edusemiotics is a relatively new branch of the philosophy of education, which, in the author's view, has the potential for rethinking and resolving the contradictions that have accumulated in the system of modern Russian education. Having been established as a separate branch of the philosophy of education in the United States in 2010-2016, the semiotics of education is called upon to resist the Cartesian dualism of the subject and object, the labyrinths of analytical philosophy and the objective method of the modern era, which rejects human subjectivity as the only basis for the study of education. The author considers the principles of the edusemiotics to be topical at present: the primacy of the process of education over the result, the rejection of the principle of consistency and the logic of the "excluded middle" (i.e. the direct transfer of knowledge or skills from the teacher to the student, bypassing the stage of their interpretation), the holistic approach to education and the ethics of integration, continuity and experimental character of education. The article discusses the sharp contradictions revealed by the author at various levels of the education system (the level of the content of education, institutional and global levels) caused by the imbalance of the processes of integration and differentiation in education. At the level of the content of education, the conflict between differentiation and integration is expressed in the fragmentation of knowledge, on the one hand, and the objective necessity of forming an integral worldview of the individual on the other hand. In the educational system as a public institution, the discreteness of the level preparation comes into conflict with the continuity of continuous education in the knowledge society. And, finally, at the global level, the desire to preserve the identity of Russian educational traditions resists the objective tendencies of the internationalization of higher education according to the Western pattern. Then, from the standpoint of edusemiotics, an attempt is made to philosophize them. The author proposes and discusses options for resolving these contradictions. The author comes to the conclusion that the semiotics of education has the potential for formulating a new metaphor for education that views education as a value, process and result; applies to a holistic, integrative approach to determining the outcome of education; pays attention to all the levels of education: pragmatic, social and existential; and, finally, takes into account the cultural appropriateness of education.

DT Article
DE European Union; lobbying; throughput legitimacy; comitology
AB The authors explore the monograph of a young scholar Daria Moiseeva (Rudenkova), holding that her research is topical for the development of political science and European studies in Russia. The book deals in detail with the lobbying practices in the EU political system. Analyzing the problem of democratic legitimacy in the EU, Moiseeva uses the concept of throughput legitimacy, which is not well known for Russian researchers. The monograph shows that the strengthening of the political component in the process of European integration generates a request for democratization of the EU political system. In order to resolve these problems, it is necessary to improve the level of transparency of the decision-making process and introduce lobbying regulation. Daria Moiseeva analyzes the practice in the post-Lisbon period of interaction between EU institutions and different interest groups/lobbyists, i.e. lobbying in the system of comitology. The Moiseeva's monograph is highly important as Russian companies working in the EU Single market need to defend under sanctions regime their interests in the EU structures.

TI "NEGATIVE" SOCIALIZATION AS A POLITICAL PROBLEM IN THE NOVEL A. HERZEN

DE A. Herzen; Who is to blame; Negative socialization; Russian radicalism;
   political novel
AB The novel of A. I. Herzen "Who is to blame?", which first appeared in the journal Otechestvennye Zapiski (1843-1846), and then printed in a separate edition (1847), made a strong impression on the Russian public. But in different periods of his existence in the literary environment, various ideas of the novel turned out to be demanded by readers and had an impact on the public agenda. Journalists and ordinary readers throughout the second half of the XIX century were looking for an answer to the question stated in the naming of the novel. And they found different options that more closely corresponded to their time, social status and social expectations. The purpose of this article is to interpret the socio-political lines of the novel and, related to it, the topic of "superfluous man" from the point of view of the author's intention. After all, Herzen's novel originally had a specific addressee, people of his own circle and education, "people of advanced convictions of the 40s." According to Herzen, guilty of the fact that Beltov (the main character) turned out to be an "extra person", unable to adapt to the conditions of the social environment, and his attempt to show civic activity turned into a failure, is a negative socialization. However, already in the late 1840's in Russian criticism, another view of Beltov, more detached, began to dominate. It was expressed by people who did not feel closeness to the hero of the novel, neither biographical nor class, people who were not afraid to repeat the fate of the "superfluous person". For example, V.G. Belinsky thought that the social fiasco of Beltov was not because his upbringing or ideological "romanticism", but because the society was not well organized, and because of his own laziness and idleness. Belinsky considered that the factor of "backwardness" of the Russian society was the paramount and determining in the fate of the hero. Thus, the socio-political line of the novel and the theme of the "superfluous man" was conceived by Herzen as a message, as a warning for "wonderful and capable people" of a close circle. But by the critics, who didn't belong to this circle, it was read as a text full of pathos of social determinism.

The problems of interaction of great powers in terms of maintaining the balance of power in Europe and in the world, the difficulty in defining effective forms of cooperation and achieving a mutually beneficial result are in the focus of this research. The author determines the essence of the Hague process, its interstate and supranational components. He draws a conclusion that after 1945 this process unfolded in two ways: the UN and regional alliances. The article is written on the materials of the Archive of the Foreign Policy of the Russian Empire. It helps to assess the important role of Russia as the initiator of the conference. The material will be of interest to historians and political scientists.

DE Russia; Post-Soviet identity; individualism; collectivism; nationalism;
   freedom; patriotism; conservative revolution; solidarity(3)
AB This paper looks at the changes of values in the process of the formation of Russian identity over the past quarter century. Beginning from the collapse of the USSR (1991) Russia has been forming a new post-Soviet Russian identity, a system of priority values aimed at strengthening the unity of the multi-national, multi-confessional country with deep social and wealth inequalities. The milestones along that path were Boris Yeltsin's famous appeal to the intelligentsia (August 1996) to formulate a new ideology, a Russian idea and, twenty years later, Vladimir Putin's appeal (October 2016) to the expert community to formulate the concept of a law on the Russian civil nation later renamed The Law on the Basics of State Nationalities Policy. Without doubt, at the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries Russia saw a change of value paradigms from individualism to nationalism. Until the first decade of the 21st century Russia positioned itself as a European power embracing universal human values. For the majority of Russians the priority was the quality of their private lives. Freedom and stability were the fundamental values of that era. In the early years of this century Russia began to assert itself as a power independent of the West, a distinct Russian civilisation, "the Greater Russian World," spreading beyond the state borders of the Russian Federation. The values of isolationism, the issues of ethnic identity and the problem of national self-determination came to the fore. Today the dominant value in Russia is patriotism based on the policy of historical memory and a return to the sources. However, it is obvious that the peoples of a multi-ethnic state have different roots, so a return to the sources divides rather than unites. A new value gaining popularity in Russia is nationalism based on the idea of solidarity. To understand what myth of the civil nation is taking shape in Russia today it is important to reveal the strengths and weaknesses of nationalism and to determine whether there is a difference between nationalism and patriotism, between civil and ethnic forms of nationalism.

Still after three months the government has not been formed. There are several reasons: most key separatists were put under arrest; the former head of regional government C. Puigdemont fled to Brussels and unsuccessfully tried to be reelected in absentia to this post. The constitutional court of Spain so far has disrupted these plans, but the new president of the parliament of Catalonia R. Torrent repeatedly put forward for nomination unacceptable candidates.

TI CRUSADERS IN SUBCARPATHIA. ON THE EASTERN EXPANSION OF THE HUNGARIAN
   KINGDOM IN THE EARLY 13TH CENTURY*
SO RUSIN
LA English
DT Article
DE Teutonic order; Subcarpathia; Danube lands; Kingdom of Hungary; Cuman
   steppe; Galician Principality
AB The article dwells on the stay of the Teutonic Order on the Southeastern borders of the Hungarian kingdom and their expansion to the Carpathian-Danube region in 1211-1225, focusing on the reasons why the Order was invited by the King of Hungary and then expelled in spite of the Holy See's intercession. The author challenges the point of view that the Order was invited due to the increased number of Cuman raids, which is evidenced by the official correspondence of Papal, Hungarian King's and Bishopric chancellery only. The real reason was not the border protection, but the Kingdom's territorial expansion to the East, towards the regions formerly dependent on the Galician principality, which was at war for the heritage of Prince Roman Mstislavovich. Teutonic crusaders met the challenges brilliantly, extending the Hungarian influence to the East, far across the ``Snow Mountains''. However, by the early 1220s, the Teutonic Order had become a strong political force in Europe by virtue of successful diplomacy of Grand Master Hermann von Salza supported both by the Pope and the Emperor, competing on equal terms with elder and major orders of Templars and Hospitallers. Thus, on the one hand, Hungarian King Andrew II understood the danger of neighboring with fast raising military and political force, threatening not only newly acquired lands, but also lands of the crown. On the other hand, the political impact of the Order in the regions turned ``from the sword to the cross'', establishing Dominican proselyte mission, which further led to the foundation of the Cuman bishopric. All these became reasons for the final expulsion of the Order from the Hungarian kingdom.

AB The article is devoted to theoretical reflection of the source of the topological area of social network research. The article traces the paths of social topology development as a special methodology lens used within the network approach and originated from mathematical topology. The divisions of non mathematical topology into two branches - topology of space described in works by Kurt Lewin and Pierre Bourdieu, and topology of form defined by Rene Thom - have been substantiated in this work. According to the above-mentioned dvision, the mechanisms of topological tool application are studied in the works of the scientists who represent such main areas of the network approach as: analysis of social networks, relational sociology, and actor-network theory. It has been found that the followers of social network analysis and relational sociology are inclined to use the topological tools for determining the position of the object in a symbolic social space and emphasize its interrelations with other objects (topology of space). Moreover, the former makes use of topology as a clear method for constructing the so-called spatial maps, graphs, and plots, the latter - as a descriptive method which is far from illustrativeness. The works of John Lo, a supporter of actor-network theory, are devoted to topological instruments used for investigating the objects of network nature which possess inner dimensionality (the topology of form). Through understanding that a social object exists in the majority of spaces (regions, networks and flows are to be mentioned), a symbolic social form is constituted. On the basis of the conclusions drawn analytically, it is claimed that social topology takes the main research traits from mathematical topology and concentrates its interest both on studying the location of objects in symbolic space and spatial forms research. The decisive role in choosing the means of topology- methodology lens application belongs to a symbolic agreement on the main ontological and theoretical issues between the researchers of different areas. It is concluded that common topological views can be extended through the understanding of topology as a synthetic instrument incorporating best practices of topology both of space and form on the main ontological and theoretical issues.

AB In the paper an attempt of complex analysis of such phenomenon as biopower takes place. It is shown that it is much wider than power of medicine because there are processes of medicalization and pharmacologization of everyday life, massive expansion of new biomedical technologies in modern society. The relation of biopower to other kinds of power is also researched. Contemporary biopower is strongly connected with economi. power due to commercial and consumer tendencies in it. On the other hand, modern biopower appears a sort of "soft" power because it doesn't use direct influence or control and has more mediated methods and strategies. Nevertheless, the global socio-biological crisis as part of general anthropological crisis takes place nowadays. It is caused by ambivalence of contemporary civilizational progress and break of coevolution between the social and its biological basis. This crisis appears in such phenomena as epidemic of noncommunicable diseases, global aging, high levels of stress etc. It is argued that this crisis can become a stimulus for transformation of biopower when it begins to lose its manipulative character and turn into sphere of rational management for biological fundament of society. The medical transformations is complementary to this movement and is connected with transition of medicine to new predictive, preventive, personalized forms.

TI THE POLITICAL CRISIS OF 1730 AND THE IDEOLOGY OF PROVIDENTIAL MONARCHISM
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Russian Empire; Supreme Privy Council; Feofan (Prokopovich); absolutism;
   monarchism; republicanism; constitutionalism
AB The paper deals with the analysis of the political crisis of 1730 in Russia. The author questions the influential approach which treats the political aspirations of the Supreme Privy Council as "republican" and constitutionalist. Even though some of the contemporaries indeed perceived the crisis as an attempt to introduce the republican form of government, the projects designed by the Supreme Privy Council lacked any innovative ideology regarding the genesis and character of political power. Thus, the Supreme Privy Council had to use the more traditional political glossary of providential monarchism based upon the recognition of royal charisma deriving directly from God; such a manner had already been developed in the court panegyric and sermon of the Petrine time. The very "conditions" that supposedly limited the power of the monarch were presented as the monarch's gift to his subjects, alongside with the army, the fleet, the state apparatus, industry and science, all "created" by Peter the Great, as the official ideology was saying. Thus, the conceptual language of the projects of the Supreme Privy Council suffered from contradictions, while the part of "conditions" that threatened the newly elected Anna Ioannovna with the loss of the crown in case she broke her promise had no analogues in the European republican and constitutional tradition. Consequently, the power of Anna Ioannovna was described as deriving from Providence by means of a popular "vote", and the recognition of such a "vote" could not lead to any limitation of her sovereign power. The refusal from "conditions" that the Supreme Privy Council imposed upon Anna was exactly an act of pursuit of the "common good" by the empress made at the request of her loyal subjects. Later, the providential legitimacy of Anna was never put to doubt, for the panegyrists like V.K. Tredyakovskii or Feofan (Prokopovich) described her as a "God-given" monarch. Since the Supreme Privy Council attempted to impose limitations on Anna's power while simultaneously recognizing her as a "God-given" monarch, its projects could not be characterized as "republican", and could only be seen as "constitutionalist" in a very broad sense. In addition, the very attempt of the Supreme Privy Council to bind Anna Ioannovna by a written promise can be interpreted (following A.B. Plotinkov's opinion) within he administrative and organizational logic of the reign of Catherine I, when the members of the council de facto ruled the Empire, and, under new circumstances, probably decided to guarantee their position by means of a written act.

AB Post-Soviet development of Russia and Mongolia within the confines of the democratic political system and civil society institutions for the last twenty years, freedom of conscience, lack of state ideology, and shifts in the socio-economic structure has significantly changed the position of Buddhist religion in these countries. Buddhism's development in Russia and Mongolia is interpreted ambiguously in the public information space, scientific literature and social mind. This process affects all aspects of social life; it has socio-cultural, political and economic content and takes place both at the institutionalized level of religious organizations and in everyday practices of social interaction. The "revival"of Buddhism in Russia and Mongolia is based primarily on the socio-cultural patterns of Gelug, the school of Tibetan Buddhism, in those forms that had been established by the beginning of the 20th century, including the church-monastic organization, the education system, cult and parish systems. In addition, Buddhist organizations both in Russia and in Mongolia demonstrate a high adaptive potential through implementation of modern educational programs, active participation in socio-political processes, foundation of new organizational structures, involvement of new believers. The study of the interaction between society and the sangha in these countries has a number of important aspects, among which there is the comparative analysis of the political role of Buddhist organizations and groups, the peculiarities of spreading Buddhist ideas in the information space, and adaptation of the cult system to the changed public needs.

AB The paper is devoted to the Soviet re-emigration policy after the World War II. During this period, when about five million people returned to the Soviet Union as a consequence of the WW2, the Soviet state implemented a wide-scale re-emigration programme. In 1945-1949, more than 106 000 former emigrants, ethnic refugees and their descendants voluntary came to the USSR from the countries of Europe, Middle East and Asia. Re-emigration was represented by ethnic migration. It was preceded by the campaign of "sovietization" of "white immigrants" and diasporas. Re-emigration is analysed in the paper in the context of the state strategy and priorities of the accommodating territories. It was implemented on the basis of agreements between the federal authorities and the governments of Russian, Armenian, Ukrainian and Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republics in a form of republican re-emigration programmes. However, a full-scale control of central authorities was arranged. An assessment of federal and republican policy in the sphere of re-emigration is provided in the article. It also addresses major trends in the area of migration, its priorities and scales. The author states that due to re-emigration, only Armenia managed to increase the number of its population and partially compensated the losses of the war. The success of the programme was conditioned by international political context and by the Armenian diaspora's co-financing of the resettlement. The approaches to the implementation of the re-emigration programmes and practices of relocation, accommodation and employment of re-emigrants, as well as the evaluation of the efficacy of using new labour resources are provided in the paper based on the data of the USSR Repatriation Department of the Council of the People's Commissars/ Council of Ministers, and of the executive powers of the republican and regional levels.

AB The socio-economic changes in the territory of the former USSR, the processes of ethno-religious revival revealed the relevance of the traditional heritage, which in the process of historical heritage has allowed developing tolerant and good-neighbourly relations in the Russian Federation. In this regard, the second half of the 18th century - the first quarter of the 20th century is a special period for the social thought of the Tatars, as after three hundred years of stagnation it is reviving. But the study of the history of the revival of the Tatars' social and theological thought and in particular the problems of Islamic law of this period involves primarily the identification of the main cultural, social and political factors that influenced its formation and development. The most important of these factors for the Tatars was Islam. The Islamic religious tradition was firmly established and maintained, despite the socio-political events that took place in the region. The Mongol invasion, the collapse of the Golden Horde, the conquest of the Kazan khanate did not change the religious situation in the region. After the capture of Kazan up to the end of the 18th century there was stagnation in the social life and social thought of the Tatars. Despite this, after the issuance of the decree on religious tolerance by Catherine II, there began a rapid process of the revival of the Tatars' social thought. As the Tatars received religious education in the world's famous religious centres, the ideas of theologians of the Islamic world had a significant impact on the formation of their views. The second most important factor that influenced the formation of the ideas of the Tatar thinkers was the ideas of European and Russian reformers. The Tatar thinkers got acquainted with them as a result of communication with the Russian intelligentsia, thanks to the development of the education system, as well as from the works of thinkers. Thus, the mentioned factors influenced the formation of the reform ideas in the Tatar theological thought, which contributed to the socio-economic development of the Tatar society.

ID POLICY; POWER
AB A number of studies have recently emphasized that while criteria of effectiveness of the European foreign policy have often focused on the EU foreign policy making, less attention has been paid to the analysis of policy adoption on the ground. In other words, a receiving side of the European Union foreign policy has not been studied sufficiently. This article aims to address this gap by looking at how the EU foreign policy narrative is perceived in Armenia and how this perception affects its effectiveness. In particular, the article first traces the European Union's narrative in the areas of democratization, welfare and security. It then proceeds with the analysis of how the EU's narrative is being received by Armenian political elites, by drawing on official documentation, semi-structured interviews and survey data. The April 2017 elections programmes, as well as opinion polls data are also analyzed. Several obstacles to the image formation of the European Union as a stable and reliable partner are identified, in particular: a weak degree of awareness among general public and the expert community about projects funded by the EU in Armenia; the absence of a monitoring system for the funds invested which gives the ground for corruption development, already widespread; proliferation of bureaucratic apparatus. Despite the fact that the efforts made by the European Union to support democratic reforms, economic development, peaceful resolution of conflicts are recognized as important, their effect is not obvious to the expert community and political elite. At the same time, the country's institutional development is directly related to its ability to impede tensions in the region and the resumption of hostilities in Nagorno-Karabakh. The April 2017 elections demonstrated that there is a distinct urge for a strong Armenian state that would unite not only the population of the country, but also Armenian diaspora and the people of Nagorno-Karabakh. In this respect, for most experts and government officials, the importance of cooperation with Russia and its diplomatic role as an intermediary in this conflict is indisputable. On the other hand, the transition to the concept of a "principled pragmatism" in the EU neighborhood policy corresponds with the continuing tendency in Armenia for a multi-vector foreign policy and selective attitude to cooperation with various partners.

DT Article
DE Ulugh Muhammad; Mahmud; Khalil; Mustafa; Khanate of Kazan; Muscovy;
   Great Horde
AB Research objective: To analyze historical sources and modern studies of the rule of Ulugh Muhammad's sons in the Khanate of Kazan.
   Research materials: On the basis of study of a wide range of sources (the Russian chronicles, books of official orders in the Russian state, ambassadorial documents, historical acts, the Turko-Tatar narrative sources, notes of foreigner visitors, etc.) and specialized modern research works, the author of this article reveals the problems of representation of the Khanate of Kazan's history during the period of Ulugh Muhammad's sons' rule.
   Research results and novelty: The author gave a special place in the research methodology to textological and hermeneutic analysis. Due to this, the author managed not only to verify the information of various sources, but also to interpret certain historical information on the basis of the context of sources that were considered authentic in that era. The author of the article is inclined to think that the succession of power from Ulugh Muhammad to Mahmud was legitimate. He clarifies the chronological framework of the rule and political status of the first Kazan khans, criticizes the arguments of modern historians, and puts forward a hypothesis about the rule in Kazan of Mustafa bin Ulugh Muhammad. As a result of the research, the author managed to adjust the perception of political history of the Khanate of Kazan during the rule of Ulugh Muhammad's sons.

AB The article focuses on the course of events on the eve of the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, describing preparations for and attempts to boycott the games. It analyses global political threats to the Olympic movement that arose when preparations for the XI Olympic games were under way and which point to the double role of sport in Nazi-Germany: It served as an effective means for preparing for the future war and the propagandistic backing of the racial theory, state-driven anti-Semitism and militarization of the Third Reich. The authors expose attempts to boycott the games, as well as the joint international struggle of various social groups to organize an alternative Olympiad in Barcelona. The article demonstrates the Nazi-leaderships' ploy to deceive the International Olympic Committee and the subjective factors that affected the decision to refrain from boycotting the Berlin games. It discusses the implications resulting from the games and the failed boycott with regards to Nazi Germany's preparations for WWII and concludes that the lessons from the Berlin Olympics are particularly important in the context of "early warning systems" of emerging forms of racism and xenophobia at the state-level.

AB The international conference "Three dates in the tragic fifty years of Europe (1598-1618-1648): Russia and the West during the Time of Troubles, religious conflicts, and the Thirty Years' War" was held at the Institute of World History of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow, on September 19-21, 2018. The conference was jointly organized by the Institute of World History and the Institute for Advanced Research in History with financial assistance from "Transneft" JSC. The organizing committee, besides the staff of the Institute of World History, included specialists from the Institute of Slavonic Studies and the Institute of Russian History of the Russian Academy of Sciences, as well as from the German Historical Institute in Moscow and the University of Warsaw (Poland). The conference was attended by more than 100 Russian and foreign scholars, historians from the Czech Republic, France, Hungary, Austria, Belarus, Germany, USA, Belgium, Poland, as well as representatives of leading scientific centers of Moscow and St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, Smolensk, Rostov-on-Don, Oryol, Petrozavodsk, Volgograd, Lipetsk, and other cities of the Russian Federation. The main theme of the conference was the multifaceted interaction of Russia and the leading countries of Western and Central Europe ("Russia in the World"). However, the topic was defined broadly enough to embrace the important fourty-year period: from the 'appeasement' of 1598 (the Edict of Nantes in France and the Peace of Vervins between France and Spain) to the Troubles in Russia and the military conflict in which almost all European countries were involved, resulting in the Peace of Westphalia (1648). This approach made it possible to address deeper problems - from the characteristics of absolute monarchy in different countries and the interaction of monarchical regimes striving for absolutism with representative bodies to confessionalization and millenarian expectations. Conference participants emphasized the importance of the synchronic-historical approach that provides opportunities for scholarly communication between specialists in the history of different countries as well as between researchers specializing in different areas of historical knowledge (political history, history of religious movements, military history, history of diplomacy).

AB Traditional forms of marriage and wedding rituals of the peoples of Dagestan have always been the object of attention and study of ethnographers. However, it was often studied only the wedding and rituals of the rural population, when urban rites and forms of marriage are poorly described. In addition, the socio-economic, political, ideological and other changes that have occurred in the region in recent times have made certain adjustments and transformations in family and marriage relations. Modern forms and conditions of marriage in the cities of Dagestan differ in many respects from the old ones, and some archaic forms do not occur today at all.

AB This paper explores the Buryat Bolsheviks' efforts to replace the religious identity of fellow Buryats with a Soviet identity in the wake of the Russian Revolution, and analyses the ways in which the Buddhist community attempted to adapt to totalitarian rule. In addition to fostering a general atmosphere of intolerance to religion, considered an antagonistic worldview, the Bolsheviks set out to promote the cultural assimilation of this non-Russian population within the Russian ethnic majority. This entailed a programme of education in the spirit of Soviet patriotism and loyalty, designed to ensure the ideological unity of the nation. Over a short historical period from the early 1920s to the early 1930s, the attitude of the Soviet authorities towards Buddhist religion, clergy and believers shifted radically, from tolerance towards the religion of the 'oppressed non-Russian masses' to uncompromising antagonism and the targeting of religion as a class enemy that must be annihilated in the name of creating 'a new man'.

AB The article examines the main areas of cooperation between the Orthodox Church and medical institutions in Russia. It is shown that the Church, as well as medical and preventive institutions, are trying to determine the necessary and appropriate vectors for the development of medical care for people who need it. The article reveals historical parallels, indicating the readiness of doctors and representatives of the Orthodox Church to solve emerging problems and determine the prospects for development. The relationship between the spiritual and physical health of the Russian population is shown, which manifests itself in the context of socio-economic reforms.
   We consider the historical experience of organization of church medical aid, which can help in the development of algorithms and conceptual principles for the creation of charitable communities, the formation of which will ensure the stable functioning of medical institutions, regardless of political situation and geographical location.
   The author independently conducted an analytical review of domestic and foreign literature on this topic, compiled a research program, developed statistical accounting forms, collected medical, historical and statistical information. The planning, compilation of statistical processing programs and the processing itself were carried out in educational institutions and scientific centers.

AB This review considers the book Afghanistan: The USSR Military and Political Presence. 1979 - 1989 by V. S. Khristoforov (published by the Institute of Russian History of the Russian Academy of Sciences in 2016). According to the reviewer, the work reflects the perception of an officer of the USSR KGB Mission in Afghanistan, who was also a qualified historian and Orientalist. The research is based on materials from the Central Archive of the FSB, the Archives of the Foreign Policy of the Russian Federation, and the Russian State Archive of Contemporary History. The author also refers to a number of documents from Afghan archives. V. S. Khristoforov is critical of Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan, emphasising that it undermined the USSR's authority in the international arena. He proves that during the presence of Soviet counselors in Afghanistan, it was their responsibility to take decisions: the Afghan leaders practically recused themselves from ruling the country. Additionally, the author demonstrates that the Soviet pullout from Afghanistan did not result in the normalisation of the country's situation. The reviewer maintains that the book makes a considerable contribution to the historiography of the issue in question.

In this article, the author attempts to answer three basic questions about that vision: What is Russia's long-term aim in regard to missile defense? Does it still want a new agreement with the United States that limits missile defense? And what kind of agreement could it be?

AB The article presents an overview of epistolary heritage and other documents of French thinker, diplomat, and writer Joseph de Maistre, that are stored in the Archive of Savoy (Chambery, France). The Savoy Archive is a major research center which contains in its personal provenance fonds correspondence, essays, notes, and dispatches of J. de Maistre. Chambery was the Savoy thinker's hometown, a place where his personality and views were formed and where his complex life path began. The authors analyze the main problems that worried J. de Maistre and were reflected in his works and letters which may be found in the archive of Chamber. While Working with archival documents, the authors used source studies methods: firstly, such general scientific methods as retrospective and analytical approach; secondly, comparative analysis; thirdly, source studies methods, such as critical and heuristic approach. These methods have allowed to analyze the epistolary legacy of J. de Maistre, to identify the yet unpublished sources and to interpret them. All these documents help to reveal the circle of his Russian correspondents. The research allows to interpret the views of the French philosopher, one of the founders of political conservatism. The authors emphasize that it was in Russia that he created his main works that influenced the emerging Russian conservative socio-political thought. The study of archival fonds helps to determine his social circle While serving in Russia (1803-1817) as a Sardinian envoy. The analysis of these documents assesses his influence on the Russian political elite and Emperor Alexander I himself These documents have great value for a number of reasons. Firstly, they allow to trace the evolution of Joseph de Maistre's views, his career, social and political activities; secondly, they reflect the Russo-French relations in one of most crucial periods of the European history, that of the Napoleonic wars. The authors point out that fomiation and evolution of Napoleon Bonaparte's image in Russia was closely connected with the name of Joseph de Maistre. Thus, it is important to study theheritage of the French emigrants, the French at the Russian Emperor's service or on a diplomatic mission in St. Petersburg. Studying de Maistre's views allows not only to monitor his ideological attitudes and their evolution, but also to identify the mechanisms of their adoption in Russia. The accumulated scientific material allows the authors to come to certain conclusions, which are valuable for studying not just J. de Maistre's views and influence, but also Russo -French relations in the Napoleonic era. Thus, the analysis of archival materials of the J. de Maistre's fond significantly expands our understanding of international relations in early 19th century, interaction of two cultures, history of the Russian socio-political thought.

AB The relationship between the PRC and the DPRK is fully described by the expression "friendship, bound together with blood." On the other hand, DPRK has always tried to maneuver between the USSR and the PRC. At present times the strategically "difficult choice" of Beijing has not yet been made, but at the tactical level it is determined by the political situation. As a result of Washington's actions, Sino-Korean relations may go into a warming period again.

AB An attempt is made to analyze the results of numerous studies of the Soviet-Bulgarian relations before and during the Second world war conducted in the Bulgarian historical science. The author highlights the stages in the development of historiography of this problem. The review of the main directions of historiographical developments in this area is made. The evolution of estimates of various events of the specified chronological period in the historical literature from 1950s to 2000s is considered. The author highlights a range of issues that still remain debatable: the question on determining the political regime of Bulgaria, on the role of the Comintern in its collapse and in the development of Soviet-Bulgarian relations, on the role of the Red Army in the development of events in Bulgaria in September 1944, etc. It is concluded that there are still many "white spots" in so studied as it seems Soviet-Bulgarian relations on the eve and during the Second World War. The author argues that even the questions of this problem developed by the domestic and Bulgarian historians still require a balanced scientific approach.

TI WORLD WAR I IN POPULAR CULTURE OF MEMORY
SO VESTNIK PERMSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-ISTORIYA-PERM UNIVERSITY HERALD-HISTORY
LA Russian
DT Article
DE World War I; Great Britain; Germany; France; popular culture; historical
   memory
AB World War I is a unique phenomenon due to its large-scale influence on the historical process. Besides that, it started the so-called "short twentieth century", which is characterized by a multiplicity of global human cataclysms. However, its place in historical memory of countries and peoples remains ambiguous and largely depends on their subsequent historical experience. The highly complex interrelation between academic science, historical politics and memorialization practices specifies the research interest in the mechanisms of development, dissemination and assimilation of the war experience as national and supranational memory sites. Within the modern developed information society, popular genres of mass culture are increasingly translating symbols, images and myths, which shape the structure of cultural memory of historical events. The reflection of World War I in the popular memory culture is the subject of a collective monograph under review in the article. The principal novelty of the monograph is its uniqueness in relation to the problem statement. Its methodology is based on the multidisciplinary approach, which, first of all, synthesizes history and philology, and includes the principles of cultural anthropology and intellectual history, as well as the concepts of collective memory. The authors propose the idea that over the last hundred years, three "memory waves" on the war can be identified. They give an original definition of the "popular memory culture", which should not be confused with the concept of mass culture. Attention is paid to the problem of the marginalization of World War I in the collective memories of the Central and East European peoples. The book is divided into three large sections: (1) museums, exhibitions, and monuments, (2) literature and comic books, and (3) history on the move: films, television, historical theatre, and travelling. The most important conclusions include the following: (1) in the official political culture and collective memory, the history of the World War I events with statesmen and commanders in the central place is giving a way to the history of ordinary people with their traumatic experience and distress; and (2) with overcoming controversies in national versions of historical memories, this war can become a symbolic all-European memory site and can strengthen European identity based on collective grief.

DE capitalism; state capitalism; economic ideology; structure of property
   of large Russian business
AB Today an exit of the Russian economy from stagnation and its further growth and development directly depend on activity of business sector. Both economists-theorists and real businessmen speak about it. The economic science abounds with theories about importance of the liberal capitalism. However, today's realities have shown insolvency of many both microeconomic, and macroeconomic theories. For today more often political, economic and business agents unanimously declare specifics of the Russian capitalism, calling it state. The key principle of the liberal economy of "lasses-faire"has shown the insolvency. Large business concentrates huge resources, and therefore its potential is enormous. The state capitalism is the ideology which is actively criticized in foreign researches. Nevertheless, there is a question of relevance of that for Russia. The set of researches is devoted to medium and small business: the question of the importance of small and medium business constantly are taken up among science, business and political elits. However, there is also other point of view - small business in view of the existing features of the Russian reality simply can't become a "locomotive"of economy. If to pay attention to the sphere of large business, then here, frankly speaking, monopolies and oligopolies function. If to trust neoclassical economic theories, then any monopoly (as well as an oligopoly, just to a lesser extent) distorts efficiency of a market mechanism, so, reduces welfare of all contractors (both the consumer, and the state) due to redistribution of excess profits in own favor. Our research answers questions: "What business is necessary to the Russian economy? What structure of property of large business answers problems of scientific and technological development of Russia? In what measure does the state have to regulate and control large business?".

AB The article is devoted to a comprehensive analysis of educational activity of the Confucius Institute Network, the study of the role of the Institute in the dissemination of educational programs, the Chinese language and culture outside the PRC. According to the Chinese authorities the growing economic power and political influence of modern China presuppose the promotion of China as a center of modern science and education. The functioning of the Institute under the patronage of the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China creates a potential problem of defining the border between the enlightening and educational components in the Institute's activity and political propaganda. The Institute's striving for popularizing Chinese culture, introducing the broad masses of the population of other countries to the "Chinese understanding of the world" is often perceived as political context, and the Institute is viewed as an instrument of the foreign policy of the Chinese government. At the same time the educational and cultural activity of the Institute that works in more than 100 countries contributes to the intercultural communication of Chinese communities in these states and the local population. The Institute successfully integrates into the national education systems of many countries and implements numerous educational projects and programs. The authors note that despite the dynamic development, the Institute's final institutionalization has not occurred yet, and the format of activity varies from country to country, from university to university. The study attaches a high value to the Institute's contribution to interuniversity cooperation between Chinese universities and their partner universities abroad. The Institute has become China's platform for the emergence of Chinese education at the global level. Special attention is paid to the authors' consideration of the Institute functioning practice on the territory of Russia and in the Commonwealth of Independent States.

AB This article studies radio broadcasts of celebratory demonstrations of workers in 1920-30s as a form of ideological influence on the public consciousness. Audio-culture, the most wide-reaching and accessible form of mass media, had a significant impact on the audience from 1918 to 1920-30s. Radio played an important role in the solution of ideological tasks, rendering figurative and verbal influence on the masses in the Soviet Union. Explaining and spreading the changes that took place in the life and the politics of the nation, the radio created a unified space of communication. Running commentary as a communication had its rules and limitations, which had developed in the first decades of the Soviet power. Discourse stereotypes had in due course resulted in emergence of a ritualistic form of reporting, similar to demonstrations and parades themselves. The genre developing, many cliches and hackneyed phrases appeared that were to impress propaganda slogans and appeals on the listeners and to inspires emotions. Now these slogans were accessible to everyone, as reproducers were installed in the streets of cities and villages and pervaded communal flats. Event reporting intensified the emotional state of the audience, giving an impression of true popular enthusiasm. In radio reports from official festive events, message of the power inducing socio-political consolidation of the society was obvious. The research analyzes drafts of a radio program script on festive demonstration of November 7, 1939 stored in the Russian State Archive of Literature and Art (Yu. K. Olesha fond). The writer's notes indicate that the preliminary censorship and self-censorship did not allow for improvisation.

AB The article studies the commemorative medal for the centenary of the Imperial St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences as a part of the Academy's jubilee. Preserving memory of significant events is one of key aspects of culture. Jubilees and jubilee-related artifacts, i.e. commemorative medals, have their place among so called commemorative practices. Scientific community uses such practices make appeals to the authorities, to enhance its prestige, and to consolidate itself. The 1826 commemorative medal appeared to be a part of the jubilee events. The large-scale celebrations seemed to be a landmark in the history of the Academy of Sciences. Its President, Sergey Uvarov, used the opportunity to appeal to the Emperor and to show the Academy in all its glory. Medallionist Fyodor Tolstoy created for the occasion a jubilee commemorative medal, which was presented to the members of the Imperial family and other notable guests. That event was the climax of the celebration. The medal was authorized by the Emperor. Its creation therefore proved that the authorities recognized the import of the Academy of Sciences, the worth of science for the state, its military power and its political reputation. The 1826 commemorative medal symbolized Imperial favor towards the Academy of Sciences; it bears the names of three monarchs: Peter I, its founder, Alexander I, its protector at the close of its first hundred years, and Nicholas I, its hope for the new era. Several drafts of the medal prove that academician experts in numismatics participated in its creation. The authors consider the commemorative medal an important historical source and a set of symbols to be explained. The article analyses art media and studies the evolution of medal inscriptions (they were first made in Latin, but later rewritten in Russian on the Emperor's orders).

AB This is a review of the book: Sheehan H. Marxism and the Philosophy of Science. A Critical History. The First Hundred Years. (L.: Verso, 2017. XII. 450 p.). The keynote of the book serves the conviction that Marxism is a sort of "super-theory" that can explain not only any social and political life, but also profound philosophy of science, including natural science. Science is presented in the book as a form of social practice. The main idea of the Marxist philosophy of science is the status of the theory of dialectical materialism. The author shows that Marxist ideas could be considered as the origins of many disciplines: the sociology of science, the history of science, the history of technology; they had a noticeable effect on non-Marxist thought as well. However, Stalinism and Lysenkoism significantly decelerated the development of the Marxist philosophy of science.

This article attempts to analyze the main approaches to the concept of "sporting nationalism", to consider the relationship between sports and the construction of national identity. Special attention is paid to the analysis of various examples of sporting nationalism in the early Olympic movement. Unlike its predecessors, who believe that the active processes of the dehumanization of sport, its involvement in the orbit of political battles and nationalist contradictions began in the period between the First and Second World Wars, the authors of this article assume that the origins of the phenomenon of sporting nationalism in the Olympic movement should be detected at the end of the 19th century - beginning of the 20th centuries.

The aim of the work is to assess the positioning of Russia and the Russians in Polish historical films. The study is intended to enrich the concept of the essence of the politics of memory of Poland and the content of the historical memory of its citizens. Article materials can be used for professional needs by diplomats, journalists, representatives of international public organizations, experts in the field of patriotic education and organization of work with young people. During the collection and processing of the identified array of information, methods such as traditional analysis and expert interviews were used. The conducted researches showed that when creating images of Russia and its inhabitants in the Polish historical cinema, the tendency of negative positioning, determined by the political conjuncture and cultural stereotypes, dominated. For the formation of appropriate images, manipulative practices based on appealing to the sphere of emotions and using symbols with archetypal implication were used. The films of the period before 1939 and the post-Soviet era are related not only to the content, but also the technological side: in both cases, the creators used strategies to create images of someone else's and phantom enemies, demonization and dehumanization. These techniques were used to reflect not only the Soviet period of Russian history, but also the pre-revolutionary era. Accordingly, not only the Soviet regime, but Russia, acting as the historical, eternal enemy of Poland, was positioned in a negative way.

AB The analysis of publications of russian printed matter is of great importance not only for historical science, but for educational activities that exert a great influence on the nature of interstate and interethnic interaction. In the first years of the XX century magazines and newspapers were the only source of information about the lives of both the remote territories of their own empire and the neighboring countries. Thanks to them, wide sections of Russian society learned about the events taking place in Russia and abroad. This article presents the result of study of the contents of articles in the journal "Izvestia of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs", which was published in St. Petersburg from 1912 to 1917. This printed edition was intended, first of all, for the employees of the diplomatic department, but it was also claimed by representatives of a highly educated part of society. As the object of research, articles and content of information were chosen that relate to China and its economic and political relations with other powers, including the Russian Empire. Questions that were actual for Russia the beginning of the 20th century are revealed. Documents containing information significantly influenced the formation of the intellectual elite's idea of China were noted. The main attention is paid to the description of the activities of diplomatic representations of Russia in China, the issues of territorial borders, the characteristics of military conflicts, revolutionary changes. The image of an exotic country is finally being destroyed. On the world arena there is a dynamically developing republic, which is experiencing heavy military turmoil. The study is based on the decrees and statements of the new Chinese government published on pages of the "Izvestia of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs", notes and reports of Russian diplomats, agreements between the Chinese government and foreign powers, including the Russian Empire, which, in the context of the stated topic have not been used before.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this chapter is to study the American practice of implementing the model of information economy as an example to the leading countries of the American region of the global economic system and to compile a conceptual model of formation and development of information economy in modern America.
   Methodology - For provision of compatibility of data on different regions of the global economic system, the research is performed on the basis of the previously used methodology and information platform. The values of the indicators of technosphere, sociosphere, economic sphere, and target result in information economy's formation in American countries and are compared to determine their variation from direct average; subsequently, they are compared with the global values for evaluation of percentage deviations. The research concerns countries such as USA, which is a leader in the American region with regard to the global economic system, Canada, which is the country closest to the level of economic development by the region's leader, and Brazil, which is the foremost leading country among the developing countries of the American region. The data from 2017 is used in the study.
   Results - The authors conclude that the US economy is not a deviant economic system but a true leader of the American region with regard to the the global economic system. That is, the USA shows higher level and rate of information economy's formation, but applied that for the same conceptual model as other countries of the American region. The most vivid uniqueness of the American model of establishment and development of information economy is the stage-by-stage character of the noosphere pyramid, which is manifested by vivid reduction of the area of its structural elements, the most massive of which is technosphere, which corresponds to the indicators that are standard for the leading countries of the world.
   Recommendations - The offered conceptual model is recommended for studying the formation of information economy in the America region and compare this process in other regions of the world.

AB In the article two types of interdisciplinary directions are considered: directions at the intersection of constitutional and international law and directions at the intersection of economic science and jurisprudence, including directions at the intersection with the constitutional-legal science. It is concluded that "law & economics" ("economic analysis of law") and "constitutional economics", claiming to analyze the law using economic methodology, reduce the understanding of the economic methodology only to the "mainstream" methodology. It is shown that for lawyers the so-called "classical" institutionalism is the methodologically most close direction of economic science. And for constitutional lawyers "institutional political economy" is the most close direction. It's proposed to develop a "political and economic analysis of law" (as a methodological alternative to "economic analysis of law") and "constitutional political economy" (as a methodological alternative to the "constitutional economics") in framework of "institutional political economy".

AB Introduction. Sweden and Finland obtain a special position within NATO strategy towards neutral states. The purpose of the paper is to analyze the background and perspectives for Sweden and Finland to join NATO in the 1990s - 2000s. This issue appeared on the top of agenda after these countries had entered the EU, and right after the Baltic states became members of NATO.
   Finland started to distant itself from Russia in 1990-1992, right after recognizing itself free from military and technical limitations set in the Peace treaty signed in 1947 and gaining an ability to arrange political and military alliances with other countries. Joining the Alliance has first appeared on the Finnish political agenda in the first half of the 1990s, though the political elite of Finland defining its practical relations with NATO also took into consideration the position of Russia since both countries had a long joint terrestrial border and close economic relations. Sweden started revising its foreign policy vector in 1991. The governing elite had an active discussion which ended with a compromise decision on preserving the neutral status of the country alongside with enforcing its defensive capacities.
   Since 1992, Finland and Sweden became participants of various agreements with NATO. Their armed forces and armaments systems have adopted the NATO standards, and have been working out their practical interaction during the joint military maneuvers and within Partnership for Peace program. In 2009 Nordic defense cooperation emerged, including three NATO participants - Iceland, Norway and Denmark. In April 2014 they signed an agreement on close military cooperation.
   Results. We can state without any doubt that Finland and Sweden would join NATO only when they face a real threat towards themselves. Russian policy in the region can be a trigger for that. After Crimea annexed Russia, the amount of advocates of joining NATO increased. Nevertheless, they still remain a minority. In this situation a referendum on joining NATO appears to have no perspectives. On the contrary, we should mark that both countries became involved into "crawling" integration into NATO structures: alongside with official Partnership for Peace program it takes place in the official European integration institutions. After joining the EU in 1995 Sweden and Finland are obliged to obey the joint European security and foreign policies, i.e. arranging their military and foreign policies with basic principles and directives developed jointly with other EU members, who are also participants of NATO. Thus, neutrality of these two states becomes a phantom, especially towards Russia.

TI AMERICA IN THE WORLD AFTER HEGEMONY

DE world order; unipolar; Hubris; multipolar; polycentric; hegemonism; the
   USA; Russia; China; geopolitics
AB There are a variety of literatures that illuminate the logic and character of the post - Cold War transformation of the global system. One literature explores the rise and decline of the great powers and the international orders that they establish and dominate.
   This paper explores the evolution of the international system in historical perspective with particular emphasis on the role of the United States before and after the end of the Cold War against a backdrop of broader global context.
   It concentrates on the end of bipolarity and the emergence of unipolar system with American dominance and hegemony and its further decline. Washington failed to endorse with practical means its declared goal of "benign hegemon".
   The author makes a comparative analysis between the dawn of the British Empire and current stage of crisis development of the United States with principal issue of transformation of the world order from unipolarity to multipolarity or from single power dominance to a more balanced international system.
   The paper also touches upon the strategic errors the American elite has made in its relationship with Russia and China referring to them as "adversaries and revisionist powers" hostile to the US. America shortsightedly opened the gates of modernisation before China in the vain hope to make it an ally against the Soviet Union only to be disappointed later. And it underestimated the significance of rapid Russian assertion after the break up of the Soviet Union only to have a unique situation of "two fronts" in American history.
   As a result of his research the author comes to a conclusion and thoroughly substantiates it with facts that a new world order emerges which can be referred to as "improved status-quo" or alternative order with new economic, financial and political institutions in sight as opposed to the old Breton - Woods system of post WW2 American dominance. Still the open question persists whether this transformation can be peaceful and consensual or fraught with new hardship for the people and even military confrontation among great powers.

AB The paper explores the possibilities of synthesizing different approaches to complex interpretation of Caucasian war as whole historical phenomenon. The advancement towards holistic representation of the Caucasian war is treated as a move from relatively "simple" to more complex or "enriched" interpretations. The first step on this way is an attempt to delineate the boundaries of the war as a socio-political phenomenon. The next task is getting beyond the war proper to its contexts - geopolitical, cultural-civilizational, ethno-social or areal ones. The search for modern version of an overall interpretation of Caucasian war proceeds in certain cultural-historical context, which, in turn, is subjected to the study.

DT Article
DE the theory of translation; direct speech; foregrounding; translation
   transformations
AB The article analyzes various methods of translating direct speech into Russian using concrete examples from modern Vietnamese literature. The author made an attempt to comprehend problems in translating Vietnamese literary texts full of characters' utterances and offers practical solutions to a broad range of difficulties arising in this connection. In particular, he spells out grammatical, stylistic, and culturological specifics of direct speech, which often need to be transformed in translation by means of transposition, substitution, addition, and omission. Much attention is given to the stylistic makeup of direct speech. The article also addresses issues of translation into Russian of Vietnamese greetings, foreign language inclusions, short forms of verbal communication, and colloquial cliches reflecting particular life situations.
   Topicality of the research object arises from the need to generalize the experience accumulated in translating Vietnamese literary texts into Russian and develop new theoretical provisions in the field of Vietnamese-to-Russian translation. This is an important goal, considering the emerging positive trends in Russian-Vietnamese cultural cooperation. Also, the problem of translating direct speech is connected to that of translating colloquial speech, which is of practical interest to a broad range of experts in Vietnamese studies.
   Research procedure. The research object is dialogues and utterances of fictional characters in works by modern Vietnamese authors. Various parts of direct speech, including leads, greetings and speech cliches, are highlighted and analyzed. The research indicates the influence of pronouns, sentence-final particles, and inversion on the stylistics of direct speech in Vietnamese texts. Tools of the Russian language which can be used to convey peculiarities of foregrounding in the Vietnamese language are explored.
   Methodology. The research is based on comparative, structural, and contrasting methods, in addition to stylistic analysis and logical and semantic modeling.
   Research materials. The work is based on the outcomes of research of Vietnamese literary texts and their translations done by the article's author. The translations were published in 2015 in the collection of short stories by Vietnamese writers, entitled "V Gorakh Rastet Polyn" ("Wormwood Grows in the Mountains") (the Lokid Premium publishing house).
   Theoretical groundwork for the research was laid by modern works in the science of linguistics looking into translation problems from the angle of the general theory of language, semantics, stylistics, and normativity. An emphasis was put on theoretical works developing the ideas of interconnection between the language and culture, area linguistic studies, and psycholinguistics. The research made by Vietnamese linguists enabled the article's author to view translating problems in the context of the yin-yang language concept.
   Research results. The research summarized approaches to translating direct speech in literary texts, identified major problems in translating dialogues from Vietnamese into Russian, demonstrated that the primary reason for those difficulties was different linguistic typologies of the languages, and explained the use of various translation transformation methods by the need to ensure muncomicive equivalence between the original text and the translation.
   Conclusion.
   Key results are summarized and prospects for further research are outlined. One should expect the emergence of new objects for studies of direct speech in literary texts, which derives from colloquial speech, as colloquial speech in modern Vietnam is experiencing a strong impact from socio-political factors of the country's life. These factors make further study of the issue necessary.

ID POLITICAL-ECONOMY
AB The 200th anniversary of the birth of Marx was a world-wide event. The author proves that the classical and modern economic theory of Marxism, cleansed of the layers of past dogmatism, provides answers to both fundamental and contemporary questions of economic life. Classical Marxism reveals the causes and patterns of market and capital emergence, their contradictions, the potential and limits of their development. The theory of commodity production (and the market as its form) as a particular historically specific system of social relations, and not merely a mechanism for measuring the results and costs, the theory of exploitation and subordination of labor to capital are not only characteristics of capitalism of the nineteenth century (and this capitalism is again reproduced in countries of the periphery and semi-periphery centuries later), these are the general foundations of any economy dominated by market competition, money, and profit. Modern Marxism has shown what new content these categories receive in those economic systems where production is no longer based on the reproductive industrial, but on creative, high-tech labor. This is a market in which network corporations increasingly produce not goods, but their signs which are simulacra, where network corporations manipulate consumers, using a complex system of methods of technological and economic subordination of counterparts, up to the hype. This is capital, which appropriates not only surplus value, but also intellectual rent and subordinates the personality of the creative worker. But this is also the system of relations in which both elements of post-capitalist relations-public regulation, the withdrawal of a part of the profits of the owners of capital and its use for public needs, the property of everyone for everything (free unlimited access to public benefits -culture, education, etc.) are developed and undermined its bases. Such are counterpoints of the market and capital of the 21st century, revealed not only by Marx, but also by modern Marxists all over the world.

AB In the 20th century there were several emigration flows of the Ingush to Europe. The first mass emigration took place in the post-revolutionary period. After 1917, the centres of the social, political and cultural activities of the Ingush Diaspora were Paris, Berlin, Prague and Warsaw. In that period, most Ingush emigrants belonged to the military, political and scientific-cultural elite, which explains the high level of the social and cultural values created by them in foreign countries. It is the social and political life and the spiritual heritage of the Ingush emigrants, being abroad for certain reasons in different historical periods, which is a very interesting subject for research. The article analyzes the process of the formation of the institutional basis of the Ingush post-revolutionary community in Europe. There is shown the role of public figures, in particular S. Malsagov and the Dzhabagiev brothers, who made a significant contribution to the development of the Ingush spiritual culture and science. The author notes that the most visible in the public and political life of the North Caucasian post-revolutionary community in Europe were the activities of the organizations and movements, which sympathized with the ideas of the Caucasus independence. As a result of the research, the author comes to the conclusion that the socio-political associations of the North Caucasian emigrants in Western Europe played a significant role in the socio-cultural adaptation of national communities of peoples of the North Caucasus abroad. Although the process of the social and cultural integration was rather difficult and long, the Ingush Diaspora preserved its national identity. The article is based on the memoirs, emigrant periodicals and electronic publications devoted to the problems of the political-legal and socio-cultural adaptation of the Ingush immigrants in Europe. In order to analyze the history of the Ingush emigrants, there are also presented unpublished documents stored in the Russian state archive of literature and art (RGALI).

AB Problems of education of the Russian Empire through the accession of the peoples and Land's, and political and legal characteristics of the domestic policies of Russia hold far from the leading place in the creative heritage of Karl Marx, but for residents of the former Soviet Union at the throughout the Soviet period, his remarks on the subject have a fundamental methodological significance. But many of his statements made in the context of the overall discourse on various issues of world history not afishirovalis scientists. The author of this publication does not question the truly encyclopaedic views of Karl Marx on the interpretation of the formative development problems of the institutions of State and law in the history of mankind. But there have been scientifically flawless approval in which individual pages of our State and legal history exposed defamatory criticism? I think that the 200 year anniversary of the birth of Karl Marx gives reason to understand some of them, and that is the purpose of the present work.

TI SOCIAL MOBILITY CONCEPT IN CHANGING SOCIETIES
SO SOTSIOLOGICHESKIE ISSLEDOVANIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE social mobility; social structure; classes; modern society; culture
AB The concept of social mobility, as many other concepts, that underpin modern sociology is undergoing substantial evolution under the influence of change that occurs in modern societies often characterized as "fluid" and unstable. The mobility theory has been used by sociologists to diagnose the state of society, discover the directions to which it was heading. Early at the start of mobility studies one of the founders of social mobility theory called for a complex view of it, proposed to view as complex, inter-related moves of people, objects and ideas. P. Sorokin called for a study of mobility that incorporated not only human beings, but also artifacts and ideas. He regarded a complex view of mobility as opening a new perspective on change in modern societies. However, in the wake of the turbulent war and revolution ridden period the accent of mobility studies shifted, the rise of an industrial society placed emphasis on the study of work-place change and inter-class transition. Urbanization stressed geographical mobility from village to city. These ideas became central for many empirical studies, viewing modern society as a space of inter-class transition, primarily transitions into the growing middle class. The new hegemonic project led to a new emphasis on the reproduction and expansion of the middle class. The middle class society became a model for many developing countries. The ideology of mobility that inspired their many reformers and revolutionary leaders in the third world who often strove to adopt a policy of mobility at all costs. The policy led to serious complications, discord of social positions, tensions, political tension including as a result of the inability of the young reformist regimes to solve the problem of structural weaknesses of developing countries. The ideology and practice of mobility met with problems of inter-class barriers and their limited permeability as well as with the problem of culture that appeared to be less flexible than social positions. It is fair to assume that many of the negative phenomena in the Arab countries or other less fortunate parts of the world are the outcome of the failed mobility projects, dashed hopes of prosperity and better life for the masses. In early 21st century it is appropriate to discuss new tacks of mobility theory, marking a return to a multiple approach to mobility that would equally take into account its structural and subjective aspects, compare societal and individual perceptions of success, relate workplace stability, geographical, housing and other dimensions that make modern society so fluid.

AB Following the growth of Russian political interests in Inner Asia in the mid-19th century, the Russian Imperial Geographical Society (RGS) initiated a series of extensive multi-disciplinary field studies of the region, including areas which now are part of the People's Republic of China. These expeditions aimed to provide the Russian government and academia with detailed information on the region's ethnographic, geological, botanical and other features and also to promote Russian science on an international level. One of the longest expeditions, in terms of both time and distance, was that of Vladimir Obruchev, the future renowned novelist and Soviet academician, who at that time was a young Siberian geologist. In the span of two years beginning in September 1892, he covered a distance of more than 15,000 kilometers inside China. He was inspired by the studies of Ferdinand von Richthofen on loess soils that are found only on the Chinese Loess Plateau. Utilizing the route description from Obruchev's memoir "From Kyakhta to Kuldzha" (1940), the original copies of his field report to the Russian Imperial Geographical Society (1900), and various materials from the archive of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the library of the Institute of Geography, and the archive of the Russian Imperial Geographical Society, as well as Chinese databases and maps, the author made a detailed geographical and chronological reconstruction of the expedition route and itinerary on the modern map of China. More than 100 places have been identified and those points are available online as an interactive presentation. This contribution also presents a novel approach for studying the history of geographical exploration with all its complexity.

AB Development of power interconnections in Northeast Asia becomes not only engineering but also a political issue. More research institutes are involved in the Asian Super Grid initiative discussion, as well as more politicians mention power interconnection opportunities. UNESCAP started providing a platform for intragovernmental discussion of the issue. However, there are still a lack of comprehensive modern research of the Asian Super Grid. Moreover, there is no unified data base and no unified power routes concept. Therefore, this article discusses a tool for optimal power routes selection and suggest a concept of the unified data portal.

AB Farms across the globe are frequently subjected to many external shocks - from natural and climatic to economic, societal or political. Farm resilience to such shocks is thus of crucial importance for food security. Improving resilience of farms in transition countries may be of a particular importance as these farms still suffer from high technical inefficiencies and structural weaknesses. This study addresses the issue of organizational resilience in Russian agricultural enterprises, and focuses on the differences between various legal forms - cooperatives, limited liability companies, and joint stock companies. Using financial statement data from farms in northwestern Russia from 2001 to 2012, descriptive analysis and a fixed-effect growth model, we investigate farm resilience in the form of post-2008 crisis sales growth robustness and recovery. The empirical results show a significant negative effect of the economic crisis on farm production and farm survival rate, both of which suggest low farm resilience. The recovery from the economic crisis was mainly driven by farm restructuring, in which the formation of limited liability companies played a significant role. Profitability (performance) was also found to significantly increase farm resilience; not necessarily farm robustness, but farms' speed of recover from the negative consequences of the economic shock.

The purpose of the article is to draw the attention of specialists studying similar organizations, as well as public policy in Russia, to the specifics of non- Western experience in this area of political activity. The book is interesting because the author deliberately focuses on the unproductiveness of the endless replication of Western theoretical and methodological experience in other civilizational conditions and offers an analysis of practices of development and functioning of public organizations that are authentic for China, Indonesia, South Korea, Japan and other Asian countries. In 11 out of 12 sections the author analyzes the content of global / Western concepts and the experience of countries in the Asia- Pacific region. Theoretically, substantive differences in the concepts of "management" and political responses to public requests (politics), concepts of "management" and "administration" are considered. Professor Im's book is of interest both from the methodological point of view and from the point of view of the possibility of immersion in the specificity of the Asian culture of the activities of public organizations.

AB This paper provides a philosophical analysis of the Internet technologies from the perspective of trans-science development. According to the author, these technologies should be explored as a qualitatively new sphere of human creative and constructive activities as they become a powerful generator and a good amplifier of cultural progress and innovations. It is proved that the active role of cognition is the most important aspect of the constructivism paradigm as the methodology of this type of technologies. The idea that trans-humanism is directed to the decision of trans-science issues, mostly having a constructive nature under the influence of virtualization of human consciousness and social relations, is developed. The article demonstrates by the example of the 'instrumental rationality' paradigm that any technologies including the Internet cannot be used in vacuum; they are interconnected and imply a number of political, economical and social aspects, which accompany them. As a result, they are becoming a characteristic of the public style of thinking. The author concludes on the basis of the analysis performed that the Internet technologies are able to settle the challenges arising under the influence of the current severe ecological crisis taking into consideration such concepts as stable social progress by means of searching reasonable answers to trans-science issues and passing the limits of trans-humanism.

ID FORESIGHT
AB The article discusses transformations of science, technology and innovation policy as a result of emphasis on the emerging technologies. Crisis and recession were the immediate causes for their actualization, but real reasons appear to be long-term socio-economic problems, which, in turn, form requirements for emerging technologies policies. Another group of policy factors are defined by the evolution of innovation processes, including rise of innovation ecosystems and growing importance of technology diffusion. New tasks required policy transformations, with important experiments realized within technological programs like Industrie 4.0. Among key policy trends was creation of new institutions that provide, in addition to research and development, communication of actors, formation of ecosystems and clusters in the area of emerging technologies. Another focus was technology diffusion through standards, specialized platforms and related institutions. These novelties face serious challenges. Traditional policy instruments do not correlate with the needs of new actors and processes, resulting in inefficiency of efforts. Another challenge is globalization, also growing interdependencies of innovation systems. Given the scale of expected changes, there is a need for both increased coordination of government efforts, as well as increased coherence and convergence of science, technology and innovation policy with related areas, including social policy. The latter is especially important due to the human capital and social dimensions of emerging technologies development and diffusion. In turn, these changes will require new approaches to the political process in science and technology area, including improvements in anticipatory governance practices and search for new, innovative solutions.

AB Despite the growing popularity of the idea of post-capitalism and a number of symptoms that indicate that the capitalist economy is gradually transforming into something fundamentally new, the question about the social subject of transition to the post-capitalist society remains unanswered. Different authors assign this role to the working class, to the precariat, or to the "creative class". D. Davydov's thorough analysis of these three statements demonstrates their weaknesses, which he explains by the fact that they characterize the future society in the categories of the past. Being convinced that the place in the world of commodity-money relations fails to capture the social essence of the subject of the post-capitalist society, he suggests that a person, or an individual with primary values of creativity and self-realization, rather than a social class or a social group should be interpreted as this subject.
   Although Davydov thinks that a person plays the leading role in the transition to the post-capitalism, he draws attention to its ambiguous nature as a subject of post-capitalist relations. The article shows that the "society of persons" is not free from novel forms of alienation and inequality. The development of the productive forces, including automation and robotization, will narrow the space for self-realization, which can lead to the situation when the majority of the population will be in the position of "superfluous men", deprived of any life prospects.

DE Institutionalization of the Soviet higher school; students;
   proletarianization of higher education; family; youth; social and
   cultural values
AB A scientific concept of the Soviet state policy in the sphere of higher education in 1920s and its role in the system of state management of social processes and education of young people is formulated in the article by the aid of modern research methods. The study concludes that after the revolutionary events of 1917 and the Civil war, the leadership of the RCP(b) began to implement practices to radically reform the system of higher education. It was launched onto a new path of development, its proletarization reinforced and introduction of political methods of management continued. While developing state policy in the field of higher education, the emphasis was placed on radical, essential measures that served the goals and objectives of the Soviet power. The result was a qualitatively different content of education, ideological bias of social life, culture, science, and education, and strengthening of repressive policy towards representatives of the 'old-regime' higher education. The initiator of all innovations in the system of higher education in Russia in 1920s was the RCP(b)-VKP(b). The Bolsheviks social experiment in accelerated introduction of new communist socio-cultural values and proletarianization of higher education institutions proved controversial, design of Soviet higher school being extremely poor. At the same time, the higher school that existed in Russia before and achieved the trappings of consistency by 1917, also had its advantages and disadvantages. In early 1920s, in the light of new sociopolitical reality, main elements of the previous structure were reformed in a fairly rigid way by the ruling RCP(b)-VKP(b). The institutionalization of the Soviet higher school in 1920s took place when a shortage of personnel with socio-cultural, methodological, and scientific experience necessary for successful implementation of the proposed socio-economic reforms was compensated by support of state security agencies.

AB Introduction: the events in Ukraine have influenced the aggravation of the frozen Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, which is an alarming situation for Russia and the European Union. The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is one of the fiercest territorial disputes in the post-Soviet space. In 1994, the Bishkek Protocol came into force, which put an end to the bloodshed. Since August 2014, the escalation of the conflict has begun which can lead to a chain reaction and go beyond the South Caucasus, which will adversely affect the security of the entire region. The crisis in Ukraine exacerbated the Armenian-Azerbaijani confrontation: the number of clashes has increased and calls for a military solution to the dispute has begun to be made more and more often on both sides.
   Materials and Methods: works by experts on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict as well as statements by officials, politicians and public figures were used as research materials. The study uses the comparative political science method, the semantic and the scenario ones, etc.
   Results: the impact of the Ukrainian crisis on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict was analyzed. The degree of interest of the parties in its escalation was studied as well as the impact on the conflict of the countries concerned. The failure of the Minsk Group to settle the conflict was exposed.
   Discussion and Conclusions: possible scenarios for the development of the conflict were developed. These scenarios clearly reflect the positive and negative factors for the warring parties.

In the opinion of the author, this union had, first of all, a genealogical significance. The political effect of this alliance was small. The publication gives an analysis of the main stages of the prince's biography. According to the author, the main political principles implemented in Mstislav's policy are consistent legitimacy and strict compliance of politics with custom and moral norms. Strict adherence to the principle of justice gave the prince additional opportunities to manage public opinion. Politics of Mstislav created the political capital, through which Mstislav kept Rus from disintegration.

AB This paper presents results from a collaborative research project investigating European scholars from the social sciences and humanities (SSH) who acted as public intellectuals during the 2014 European Parliament (EP) election campaign. We analyze op-ed contributions published in 21 broadsheet newspapers and in 9 EU member states, written by 195 authors who contributed 262 articles. The result is a portrait of European SSH scholars acting as public intellectuals. It shows a clear overrepresentation of male authors of advanced age. Academic reputation and public prestige show an east-west divide, with prominent authors prevalently publishing in renowned West European newspapers. Disciplinary background offers the most noticeable differentiations. Political scientists are most active, however, predominantly publishing in domestic settings. By contrast, economists reach out to a wider international audience and write explicitly on EU matters, while intervening sociologists and philosophers, as the most senior intellectuals, examine Europe in its wider international and historical context. Correspondence analysis comprising the content of public interventions, and key characteristics of all contributors, suggests that even during the EU electoral campaign, scholars from the SSH do not necessarily contribute to the rise of a European public sphere, as their interventions are more domestic than European in focus.

AB The article is based on unpublished archival sources and reveals the vicissitudes associated with the publication of monographs and the defense of dissertations by the well-known Siberian historian and archaeologist Alexei Pavlovich Umansky. His contacts with the leading Russian humanitarians - Siberian experts: A.P. Okladnikov, L.P. Potapov, V.G. Mirzoev, L.R. Kyzlasov, N.A. Minenko, which are of interest for the study of scientific communication as one of the basic mechanisms of the functioning of the scientific community, are analyzed. The publication touches upon issues related to the daily scientific life of the researcher ("historiographical way of life"), as well as psychological problems caused by the need to overcome numerous difficulties on the way of scientific advancement. One of the conditions for the defense of a doctoral dissertation was the publication of the monograph, which for a provincial scientist within the existing system of organization of science was of great complexity. A tangible concrete help and substantial support to the competitor was provided by Academician A.P. Okladnikov.
   The article for the first time examines the polemics between L.P. Potapov and A.P. Umansky and analyzes an anonymous review o f his monograph, which was received by the Higher Attestation Commission. A conclusion about the superficial and tendentious nature of the review was made, largely based on historiographical stereotypes, often paying tribute to the political conjuncture.
   Almost 15 years of life A.P. Umansky spent on overcoming all difficulties with the publication of the monograph and defending the dissertation work. At the same time, the paradox and even the tragedy of the situation with his scientific advancement lies in the fact that the main material on the topic was collected, and much of the work in the draft version was written in an earlier period, even before the beginning of the preparation of the doctoral dissertation. A huge part of the time and energy was subsequently spent on overcoming bureaucratic obstacles and solving various organizational matters. Thus it is necessary to pay tribute to persistence and purposefulness of the scientist, who after each failure managed to find the strength and to move again in the chosen direction.
   Modem authors, dealing with the history of the peoples of the south of Western Siberia, appeal to the materials of A.P. Umansky in describing the eventual side of Russian colonization, describing the ethnopolitical formations that existed here, studying interstate and interethnic contacts. Based on a thorough analysis of the vast archival material, the judgments and conclusions of the researcher still have a significant weight, and he is a recognized expert in the scientific world on teleut problems.

For the analysis of obvious, latent functions of a drug addiction, its dysfunctional consequences structurally functional approach became necessary. In the theory-methodological analysis sociological concepts of deviance, an anomy, stigma, and social exclusion were important. In article concepts of a drug addiction, various properties of its categorical field allowing speaking about variety of manifestations of this phenomenon are analyzed. The phenomenon of a drug addiction is presented in this text as manifestations in real acts, in activity as result of symbolical determination of deviant behavior by subjects of social actions. The carried-out analysis allowed authors to define a modern phenomenon of a drug addiction as the difficult phenomenon which is expressed in deviant practicians of narcoconsumption and exposed to social control.

AB The review analyzes the textbook and the reader on political psychology issued by the Department of Sociology and Psychology of Politics of the Faculty of Political Science, Lomonosov Moscow State University. These books discuss questions of theory and methodology of world political psychology and applied research. The important feature of these books is the high standard they set for the profession of political psychologist. The reader presents outstanding works of foreign and Russian authors, both classics and modern psychologists. They show how the solutions were discovered for problems posed in the XIX century and even in the beginning of the XX century. Many of the works included in the reader and many chapters of the textbook provide an important feedback for the authorities, helping them to understand the psychological specifics of their country. Applied works presented in the reader help political leaders in solving their everyday problems, for example, strengthening their potential in political communication. An important result of forty years of development of Russian political psychology is the creation of an arsenal of research methods, the development of many original domestic technologies.

AB This paper examines the trade relations and trade flows between Russia and France. Both countries represent truly leading powers, one in BRICS and the other one in the European Union. Moreover, it also tackles the economic relations between these two leaders of international trade hindered by the recent political and economic problems.
   In recent years, under the influence of sanctions imposed by some Western governments against Russia, bilateral trade and investment cooperation between the two countries have undergone a number of important changes. Our paper analyses the trade turnover between the countries for several years and reveals the main changes in its structure. In spite of the overall atmosphere of restriction and sanctions, we have identified some promising areas for further economic cooperation.

DE foreign policy; Russia; Turkey; M. Kemal; Azerbaijan; Armenia; Georgia;

AB On the basis of archival documents, little-known facts in the relations between the Soviet state, the Comintern and the government of M. Kemal during the formation of the Russian and Turkish republics are considered. The policy of the Bolshevik power and the role of the Communist Internationale in establishing relations with the national movement of Turkey are analyzed. Considerable attention is paid to the question of the Bolsheviks' search for allies among the various political forces of Turkish society. The author raises the problem of contradictions between the guidelines of The Council of People's Commissars aimed at cooperation and interaction with the government of M. Kemal, and unreasonable leftist aspirations of radical elements in the Comintern and the Turkish Communist party. It is noted that the topic of political and military cooperation between Soviet Russia and Turkey is inextricably linked with the policy of both states in the Caucasus, which could become a bridge or a barrier between the two countries. The activity of both states in this region and the role of the Comintern in expanding the influence of Soviet Russia in the republics of Transcaucasia are traced. The urgency of the problem is determined by the need to establish relations with the countries of the Middle East at the present stage, the search for mechanisms of interaction and the use of positive experience and taking into account the mistakes of the past in this matter. The author comes to the conclusion that despite the ideological differences and the clash of political interests, Soviet Russia and Turkey were able to find a compromise and concluded an equal and mutually beneficial peace treaty, which marked the beginning of cooperation between the two countries.

AB The article is devoted to the problems of understanding the relationship between labor, its administration and the social perspective of society. The study is done in the framework of political philosophy and does not pretend to cover the entire scientific discourse on this topic. The author outlines two key problems: the fundamental modification of the structure of productive labor and the associated loss by society of clear future-oriented paths of development and progress. In the first part of the study, the author discusses the permeability of the boundaries between the social present and the future. The author believes that for most countries the prospect of the future is completely identified with the current state of consumption and labor organization in economically developed countries. The second part substantiates the thesis that the modern state of distribution of wealth and poverty has led to a restructuring of the labor system. The author proves that the main modern social tensions are not based on the classic "political economic faults" (contradictions between labor and capital), but are concentrated in the core of the labor system. The aim of the article is a political philosophical representation of the problem of "social future" in the conditions of modern capitalism, understood by the author as a social system of accumulation of labor in time.

DT Article
DE interrelation of Russian and Western philosophy; German and Russian
   mystical tradition; monism and dualism in metaphysics
AB The article deals with the criticism of I.I. Evlampiev's works on the history of Russian philosophy contained in A.F. Zamaleev's article "'Mystics' and 'God's fools' in Russian philosophy (polemical notes)". It is shown that the author of the article incorrectly opposes the Russian philosophy of Western philosophy. Denying the influence of the German mystical tradition on Russian philosophy A.F. Zamaleev mistakenly attributes to German philosophers a strict monism and as an important advantage of Russian philosophy recognizes the strict dualism of metaphysical conceptions. In fact, all philosophers of the 19th - early 20th century considered it necessary to combine monism with dualism; S.L. Frank even came up with a special term for such a combination of "antinomistic monodualism". It demonstrates the essential dependence of Russian philosophy on 19th century German philosophy, especially with regard to ideas about man. The model of understanding the history of European philosophy is grounded according to which two trends - empiricism and mysticism - resisted in history, and mysticism is a much more correct and deep tradition, suggesting that in the world and man there is an infinite depth inaccessible to rational knowledge. This tradition was most fully revealed in German idealism of the beginning of the 19th century and the nonclassical philosophy of the end of the century (A. Schopenhauer, F. Nietzsche, A. Bergson), Russian philosophy of the late 19th - early 20th century also tended to this tradition. It is proved that the term "religious renaissance", which is often used to characterize Russian philosophy of the early twentieth century, is counterproductive, leads away from a correct understanding of the main thing in Russian thought.

DT Article
DE regional integration; European Union; integration theories; dimensions
   of EU activity; European studies
AB The author analyzes various approaches to the study of European integration, referring to a number of recently published works on European integration and, in particular, to a unique textbook (Evropeiskaya integratsiya: uchebnik dlya vuzov. Pod red. O.V. Butorinoi, N.Yu. Kaveshnikova [ European Integration: Textbook. Ed. by O.V. Butorina, N.Yu. Kaveshnikov]. Moscow: Aspekt Press. 2016. 736 p. ( In Russ.)). The author compares the models of analysis in this book with the analytical models of European integration used in modern European studies. One of the key problems of contemporary political science is the absence of a "grand theory" of European integration. This problem could be solved by applying various middle-level theories to different dimensions of European integration. The author believes that the question of how to study European integration is far from rhetorical, especially in the light of such factors as the growing complexity of the processes within the EU, its unprecedented crisis, as well as aggravation of ideological and political tensions, including in relations between Russia and the EU. The book "European Integration" edited by Olga Butorina and Nikolai Kaveshnikov is analyzed both in the context of theoretical issues of EU development and its specific activities, as well as through the prism of European integration studies in Europe and Russia.

DE Sources; students; A. L. Shanyavskii Moscow City People's University;

AB The article is devoted to the history of revolutionary unrest among students at the turn of the 20th century. Activities of informal student associations that conducted a broad agitation campaign within the walls of the A. L. Shanyavskii University in the early 20th century serve as an example. Unlike many other higher educational institutions, the Moscow City People's University became a hotbed of revolutionary outbreaks, fueled both by teachers and students of the university. University professors N. N. Polyansky, M. D. Zagryatskov, V. V. Krasnokutsky, A. V. Gorbunov, P. P. Gensen, P. N. Sakulin, A. A. Kizevetter called for democratic reforms in their lectures and criticized the foundations of the monarchy. Among other politicized communities of the University, the Latvian Social-Democratic group, which included M. I. Latsis and I. V. Tsivtsivadze, was especially prominent. Many students united around Social Democrat Ts. Zelikson-Bobrovskaya and Bolshevik A. A. Znamensky. The students of Shanyavskii University equipped a printing house and printed leaflets of revolutionary content. On the account of frequent cases of political agitation in the student milieu, university lectures were attended by the police. Nevertheless, despite the police surveillance, the atmosphere at the university was quite liberal, and the revolutionary-minded associations continued to thrive there. The revolutionary events that were prepared with such energy (among others) by students of the A. L. Shanyavskii University and liberal-minded part of their professors, eventually led to. greater collapse of the ideals of accessible higher education that A. L. Shanyavskii preached. The Bolsheviks, having received the reins of government in 1917, could not establish a working system of administration or even approximate the however well established pre-revolutionary order, and thereupon in 1920 the University of A. L. Shanyavskii ceased to exist. Several documents found in the State Archive of the Russian Federation allow to recreate the historical picture of the revolutionary movement within the walls of the Moscow City People's University.

DT Article
DE Walter Scott; national identity; semiological system; Scotland;
   Borderlands
AB In this article the problems of the formation of national identity of the Scots at the turn of XVIII-XIX centuries are examined. Also the author analyses the historical conditions in which the formation of national identity took place and the role played by the Walter Scott's works in this process. This article deals with the problem of integrating the two previously opposing states of England and Scotland, forced under the conditions of the union of 1707 and the subsequent completion of the industrial coup to seek ways to consolidate and at the same time the possibility of preservation of ethnic uniqueness. The purpose of this article is to analyze the impact of the historical narrative in the works of Walter Scott on the formation of the most important symbols of Scottish national consciousness that are the basis of national identity. As the research problem, the author has defined an attempt to assess the degree of narrativeness of the works of Walter Scott, since this factor is crucial in the process of "invention of traditions". The author of the article argues that a necessary condition of overcoming the "crisis of identity" of a nation is an appeal to its historical memory, both by political elites and intellectuals of our time. A transformation of Scottish identity at the turn of XVIII-XIX centuries, under the influence of the intellectual elite of the United Kingdom can serve as one of the successful models of national identity formation. Special attention is paid to the creativity of the first researchers of Scottish cultural heritage. The author notes that since the mid-eighteenth century the intellectual elite of Scotland drew the research interest to the heritage of the Scottish minstrels, preserved in legends and ancient ballads. The most interesting works in this area were written by James MacPherson and Bishop Percy. In the collection of MacPherson - the poems Oceana, as the author notes, was made the most important thing: the Gaelic poetic thinking has been translated into English. In the end the author concludes that Walter Scott, in the spirit of proconstruction, by referring to the "true Scottishness", built up the dichotomy "We-they", the required basic element of national identity. Folk ballads, national characters, historical events, arranged in a system of meaningful images are interpreted in accordance with the tastes and demands of modern reality - the reality of the turn of XVIII-XIX centuries. The increased social activity of the Scots and their role in economic and political life of the United Kingdom necessitated the formation of national consciousness of success and prosperity in the British Commonwealth.

DE philosophy; worldview; religion; Islam; faith; knowledge; man; Islamic

AB This paper deals with the views of Murtaza Mutahhari (1902-1989), contemporary Iranian philosopher and a major ideologue and close associate of Ayatollah Khomeini, the leader of 1978-1979 Iranian Revolution. The author traces the growth of the political doctrine of the so-called 'Rule or guardianship by a jurist' (vilayat-i faqih), as developed by Mutahhari, and shows that the latter argues for the dominant role of religion in Iranian society on the assumption that the very foundation of the teachings of Islam is reason. The central point of Mutahhari's theory is the problem of the relation of faith (iman) to knowledge (ilm), in approaching which he follows along the traditional lines of Islamic philosophy. According to Mutahhari, between faith and knowledge there is no strict dichotomy, and indeed they are related to one another as two complementary concepts representing, respectively, the explicit and the hidden sides of the same reality. Knowledge, from this point of view, can be understood as a necessary condition of religious faith (iman-i mazhabi) which, in its turn, should be interpreted as one of the basic elements of individual consciousness and the most important 'constitutive' principle in man, Iranian society and the Islamic state.

The article deals with the organization of reception, accommodation, material and consumer services of evacuated citizens as a special social group of the population formed during the Great Patriotic war. The article reveals the labour activity, contribution of the evacuated population to the economy of the region, the mood of the evacuated in the rear and their relationship with the indigenous population. The question of the causes of mutual discontent between refugees and residents of the Republic is raised. Attention is paid to activity of the authorities directing movement and service of the evacuated population at different stages of stay of refugees in the territory of the Tatar ASSR. The scientific novelty of the research is seen in the fact that new materials found by the author in the archives are put into circulation. The study was conducted on the materials of the State Archive of the Republic of Tatarstan and the Central State Archive of historical and political documentation of the Republic of Tatarstan with the involvement of scientific and statistical literature.

First of all, the authors analyze the main position of this work, their political and economic components. The reaction of the Russian literary environment to this program publication is also considered. In particular, the polemic speech of one of the leaders of Russian symbolism - Valery Bryusov is analyzed. It is demonstrated that the publication of the article "Party organization and party literature" is due to the split of the Russian socialist workers' party at the II Congress in 1903 and the competition of its two factions of the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks. The authors of the study conclude that Lenin's polemic article as the leader of the Bolshevik faction has become a kind of ultimatum addressed to the Menshevist elite.

TI CORPORATISM IN WESTERN EUROPE: CURRENT STATE AND PROSPECTS FOR EVOLUTION
SO MGIMO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE corporatism; tripartism; a political coordination of interests; civil
   society; labor party; trade unions; lobbying
AB The article conducts a political analysis of the Western European institutions of corporatism. The main task of the author is the study of the policy of harmonizing the interests of labor and capital (trade unions and employers' associations), which is implemented in countries such as the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Denmark etc. Dynamics of political processes unfolding in the space of Western Europe, suggests that the mechanisms of articulation and political representation of social and labour interests have significantly transformed over the past 30 years. The use of institutional and systemic approaches along with the empirical methods, leads to the conclusion that the most developed European countries are moving from the classical model of corporatism to a more pluralistic forms of interaction between the state, labour and capital. Social partnership as an instrument of collective bargaining between employees and employers is displaced from the political sphere to the sectoral and organizational levels. The typical institutions of democratic corporatism (tripartite commissions, socio-economic councils, etc.), who played a crucial role in rebuilding postwar Europe, become rudimentary organs of the national political systems. In addition, there is a tendency to weaken the political influence of trade unions, who successfully struggled for the satisfaction of collective demands of workers in the beginning of XX century. Large multinational companies prefer to influence the political decision-making centers autonomously, ignoring the associative membership in the guild organizations. As a consequence, corporatist bargaining is being replaced by direct and indirect lobbying, Government Relations and election fundraising. When accounting for identified trends, the author presents a hypothesis that the evolution of corporatism in Western Europe will lead to its gradual degeneration. Taking into account the identified trends, the author presents a hypothesis that the evolution of corporatism in Western Europe leads to its gradual degeneration.

TI THE ANCIENT PERSIAN FORM OF THE FIRST MONGOL DYNASTIES' LEGITIMATION
SO ZOLOTOORDYNSKOE OBOZRENIE-GOLDEN HORDE REVIEW
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Mongols; Ilkhanids; Jochids; Farr-e izadi; power; Just Governance
AB Research objectives: To examine the ancient Persian tradition of legitimation of rule by the first Mongol dynasties.
   Materials: Medieval primary source texts of Abu. l-Qasim Ferdowsi, Nizam al-Mulk, Abu Hamid al-Ghazali, Shihab al-Din Suhrawardi, Rashid al-Din, and Abu Bakr Qalandar.
   Results and novelty of the research: Despite the fact that before the adoption of Islam, the Mongol dynasties used their own forms of legitimization of their rule, based on gaining the right to power and special grace from the heavenly god, Tengri, the Ilkhanids (Hulaguids), ruling in the Near and Middle East (from 1256 to 1353), and the Jochid rulers of various states in the Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Western Siberia (from the 13th to 17th century), who ruled in the Desht-i-Qipchaq, actively used elements of the ancient Persian concept of power, based on special divine light bestowed upon the ruler - Farr. This was accompanied by images of just rulers and the use of traditional titulature of Iranian rulers - the "king" (Shah) and the "king of kings" (Shah-i Shahan). Testimonies to this practice can be found both in the works of philosophers and historians of the period of these Mongol dynasties (for example, in the "Qalandar-name" of Abu Bakr Qalandar) and in the illustrations of the "Shahnameh" from the 14th century that portrayed the Mongolian khans in the image of ancient Persian heroes. This means that, on the one hand, the first Mongol dynasties felt some lack of legitimacy in the conquered territories, on the other hand that there was a desire of the autochthonous elites to link the new rulers to the political culture that had existed before their arrival. As concerns the Jochids, what can be asserted is the spread of an Iranian type of political culture after the migration of urban populations from the area of Persia into the Desht-i-Qipchaq.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE capitalism; culture; progress; success; religion; spirit of capitalism
AB The article is devoted to studying the interrelationship between capitalism and culture along different dimensions. Are there any "ideal" cultures that are more conducive to the development of a "modern", "economically efficient", "progressive" i.e., ultimately, capitalist, society? To which extent can we justify the attempts within the concept of "culture matters" to reshape other cultures in accordance with this ideal type? To what degree is such measure relevant for Russia? The author's analysis reveals that the ideal capitalist cultures have never existed. Capitalism in itself is a culture and even a religion. Because capitalism never states this directly, it seems that traditional religions one after another serve as voices of capitalism, replacing each other as expressions of the "spirit of capitalism". History shows that capitalism evolves and accommodates new cultures and subcultures that are much farther away from what was once considered an ideal type for a successful capitalist culture. Since culture is the last resort of the expansion of capitalism, the latter is doomed to recognize over time all the existing cultures as successful. However, this will mean its "sunset": once every culture will be recognized as successful, the recourse base of capitalism will be finally exhausted that would lead to the end of capitalism as a culture.

TI MUSLIM POLE OF THE WORLD ECONOMY AND THE GENIE OF GLOBALIZATION
SO MGIMO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Muslim economy; Islamic economy; Islamic finance; geo-economics; world
   order; polycentricism; global governance; civilizational identity;
   global balance
AB The article explores a process of gradual consolidation of disparate set of Muslim economies into an increasingly influential, though internally contradictory center of geo-economic and geopolitical gravity in contemporary multipolar world. It uses a theory developed by the authors explaining the patterns of formation and succession of models of global economic development. The article builds upon this theory by testing quantitative and qualitative parameters of the process on a specific geo-economic case.
   The contemporary developments within the economic basis of the Muslim pole and the practical requirements of economic analysis reveals the need for categorical correction and refinement of political economy. Two following terms "Muslim economy" and "Islamic economy" must be differentiated. "Muslim economy" is a civilizational form of national economies in Muslim countries and an integral part of the global economy, including both the economic life and welfare of the global Muslim population and the economic potential, sustainability and the ability for self-development of the economies of Muslim states. "Islamic Economy" is an economy that implements in practice the primacy of Shariah norms over conventional market norms, procedures and mechanisms. Both of them constitute important material conditions for sustaining the Muslim civilizational identity.
   In recent academic literature political, legal and religious aspects of Muslims upholding their identity have been sufficiently researched. In contrast the process of Muslim's world achieving a new qualitative status of a global economic power center ( not to speak about its competition with other old and new powers for a place within a new global economic order), is practically absent from the Russian and international research.
   The authors propose a vision of a new quality of Muslim economies in the global balance of power, in emerging model of the global world order, in financial globalization and global governance - the gradual consolidation of the Muslim world. The article argues that this process is still very far from reaching mature forms. Today it is hardly possible to reliably predict specific configurations of the future self-organization of the "Muslim pole" in the polycentric world and the nature of its influence on specific issues of the global world order. However, the point of no return is already passed, and the painful and contradictory process of development of such a center is unlikely to stop.

AB The article deals with the behavior of the linguistic personality in the modern information space. The main directions of pragmatic study are determined. A review of the interaction of linguistic personality and information flow in the communicative field is given. In the article we show how the modern linguistic personality chooses the source of information. We research the evaluation of the modern information. The article is based on actual and extensive statistical material. Linguistic personality in public communication reflects objectively existing features of the culture of information possession and can actively influence the development of linguistic community, increasing interest in various areas of social activity, which contributes to the formation of specific information spaces in the public communication space. The article emphasizes that in the context of globalization of the communication space in the Internet environment it becomes obvious that the view of many processes and phenomena in both socio-political and cultural, economic, etc. areas and their assessment have changed significantly, and the ability to manage information flows has been transformed.

DE social protection; custody; guardianship; Russian Empire
AB In Russia every year the number of the most vulnerable part of people for various reasons increases: orphans, disabled people, unwed mothers, children with a different incurable or serious illness, pensioners, addicts, refugees, migrants and asocial people. All of them need social protection which represents set of trustee measures and means for creation of the available environment for their activity. In the scientific article the object is set to define theoretic-methodological bases of formation of social protection in the Russian Empire. An object of a research was the sociocultural universals of the Russian language picture of the world "social protection" and a subject was verbalized concepts the "guardianship" and "charity" of the pre-revolutionary period forming it conceptual core. The methodological basis of a research is based on dialectic communication of the past with the present and application of the conceptual framework created both in historical and in social sciences as sociology and social work, political science and philology. These are such methods of a cross-disciplinary research as lexico-semantic communications and interconditionality of different types of social protection, etymological, morphological methods and the linguistic analysis. Considering a sociocultural universal of the Russian language picture of the world "social protection" authors have allocated it such basic theoretical concepts as guardianship, public charity, charity; categories of persons in need: poor, beggars, tramps, disabled people; social phenomena: alcoholism, deviant behavior. In a research it is revealed that the concept "social protection" has ancient historical traditions. Prior to the beginning of the 20th century "social protection" was called "guardianship", "public charity". The pre-revolutionary term "charity" belonged to the concept "Order of Public Charity" which is treated as the institution which was engaged in "care" about poor and sick". The concepts "care" and "guardianship" are treated as care, protection and originate from the Roman concept "guardianship". Authors draw important conclusions that researches of scientists have created a conceptual framework of a sociocultural universal "social protection" eventually. It concerns guardianship, public charity, the charity regarding charity people patterns. Authors have also come to a conclusion that scientists during the period till February 1917 classified all types of guardianship used in a scientific turn of the pre-revolutionary period: guardianship about prisons, guardianship about national sobriety, guardianship about the poor, guardianship of the Empress Maria about blind people, parish guardianship. Separately scientists allocated guardianship about national education: boards of trustees of educational institutions, trustees of educational districts. It proves the fact that care of the state of the least protected part of the population was strategically important task.

DT Article
DE French-Russian relations; French military mission; historical politics;
   World War I
AB This article considers the issue of commemoration of the French-Russian interaction during World War I and the Revolution and its description in Russian historiography. The author supposes that the study of issues of the French-Russian cooperation between 1914 and 1918 corresponds to the current public agenda and contemporary tendencies in historiography. These tendencies strive to overcome the "oblivion of World War I" and the ideological concepts of Soviet researchers in this field. At the same time, the cooperation between the two countries during World War I provides valuable examples of effective interaction that may become an integral part of the Russian politics of memory. More particularly, it means the activity of the French military mission in Russia and its local services, i.e. artillery, transport, and aviation missions. On the other hand, a comprehensive analysis of the activities of the French military mission could enrich the existing knowledge of the economic, social, and political conditions of the late Russian Empire and clarify certain subjects related to the activities of Bolsheviks in Russia. The author raises a question regarding the role of the professional community in opposing the mythology of public authorities and maintaining the conditions for a thorough exploration of the past. In order to reconstruct the activities of the French services between 1914 and 1918, the author refers to documents of the Historical Service of the French Ministry of Defence and public speeches of Russian politicians and public figures; additionally, the author considers historiography as a source representing "professional memory". The methodology of the research is based on the concepts of memorial culture and historical politics of A. Assmann, which considers historiography a special form of historical memory.

AB In post-Soviet years, the North Caucasus gained the reputation of a politically unstable, conflict-generating region, with specific problems rooted in the distant past. To better understand the essence of today's problems, it is necessary to study the complex vicissitudes of North Caucasus regional history at crucial moments. The article aims to clarify the role of the ethnic factor at the early stage of the Civil War in the North Caucasus (1917-1918). It traces the dynamics of interethnic confrontation in the very complicated poly-ethnic and multi-confessional region and the impact of this dynamics on the struggle between the opposing political forces. How did the Bolsheviks and their opponents use the ethnic factor for their own interests? Understanding the impact of ethnic identities on the conflict is of broader relevance; it is through an ethnic matrix that unresolved social problems turn into irreconcilable interethnic contradictions. This case study from the revolutionary era is based on hitherto unstudied archival material from the Russian State Archive of Social and Political History.

AB The 200th anniversary of the birth of the outstanding Tatar scholar and enlightener Shigabutdin Marjani was celebrated in 2018. Indeed, it was declared the year of Marjani by the Decree of the President of the Republic of Tatarstan Rustam Minnikhanov. During the past year, books were published while academic forums, round tables, exhibitions, lectures and public educational events were organized in honor of the educator.
   The International Research Conference, "The Academic Heritage and Social Activities of Sh. Marjani," (September 20-21, 2018) and the exhibition, "Shigabutdin Marjani. Tatar Character," occupied a prominent place among the series of events dedicated to the year of Marjani in Tatarstan. The Marjani Institute of History organized the conference and exhibition with the support of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Tatarstan and the Tatarstan Academy of Sciences.
   The conference was attended by both domestic historians and prominent foreign researchers. In total, the program of the event included four thematic sections and a round table on the history of the Tatars abroad.
   The exhibition was held in the exhibition hall "Manege." In addition to manuscripts and prints, the exhibition featured a gallery of portraits of Marjani and calligraphic works dedicated to the great Tatar theologian.
   It is necessary to note the visit of the delegation of public and political figures and researchers of Tatarstan to Uzbekistan to participate in events dedicated to the 200th anniversary of the birth of Sh. Marjani (October 15-19, 2018). In Tashkent, a meeting was held with the administration and staff of the Abu Reyhan Biruni Institute of Oriental Studies. A presentation of research publications from the Marjani Institute of History and the academic journal "Golden Horde Review" was also held during the visit.
   On November 21, 2018 in Kazan, on the shore of Lake Kaban, the grand unveiling of the Shigabutdin Marjani monument took place.
   On November 29, 2018 a delegation from Kazan visited the city of Helsinki in Finland to participate in the conference dedicated to the 200th anniversary of the scholar's birth.

   Caucasus civil structure; administrative reform
AB The article is devoted to the issues of emergence and initial period of activity of institutions related to the management of the Caucasus: Transcaucasian, Caucasian committees, Caucasian Viceroyalty, VI temporary department of the Imperial Chancery. The novelty of the research is determined by the introduction of new materials into scientific circulation, which characterize the activities of the studied bodies of the region. It is noted that the appeal to this problem allows to consider the mechanisms of governance, through which administrative reforms were carried out in the Caucasus, aimed at the integration of the region into the Russian Empire. Attention is paid to the peculiarities of the relationship of the studied bodies of management between themselves in 1930-1950-ies. Changes in approaches to the management of the Caucasus region are indicated. Special attention is paid to strengthening the Russian military and political presence in the Caucasus. The features of the administrative reforms are shown. The author comes to the conclusion that the reforms were ineffective because of the imbalance and inconsistency of the actions of the authorities, in connection with which the government was faced with the question of the need to adjustment, and in the future, a radical reorganization of the Caucasus governance. The relevance of the study is determined by the lack of research of the management of the outskirts of the Russian Empire in the national historiography.

AB The paper gives an assessment of the development of digital economy through the system of education and personnel retraining, which should provide economy with specialists who meet the requirements of the digital age. The Institute of Education is undergoing significant changes. Countries that have managed to adapt their educational infrastructure to new needs will be able to significantly strengthen their economic positions in the transition to digital economy. According to the UNESCO report, about 150 million students in the world are now in the process of obtaining a diploma. The relevance of the study lies in the fact that the sphere of education is one of the key and most promising sites for global competition of states for economic power and political influence in the 21st century. Carrying out work on improving the educational infrastructure, it is also necessary to create opportunities for self-realization of high-class specialists in Russia.

AB Goal determining quantitative interconnections between investments and economic growth in the modern Russian conditions. Discussion economic science analyzed the problems of economic dynamics and determined the main factors that influence economic growth: government expenditures, interest rate, tax load, inflation rates, expectation of changes in the market, innovations, and law. A strong source of economic growth is investments, which, from the functional point of view, are investments into material and non-material assets for the purpose of obtaining profit. The problem is determination of effective volumes and structure of investments that correspond to specific socio-economic conditions. Results the received results in the generalized form reflect the following processes: sustainable influence of cyclic processes on economic growth; growing influence of pricing and political factors of the current period; advantages of the agrarian and industrial specialization in the conditions of political and economic instability of the modern period; the necessity for strengthening the cluster policy; necessity for long-term sustainable rates of growth of investments into fixed capital that overcome the GDP dynamics.

AB This article reviews the modern hazards and challenges of national security for the Russian Federation and the need to reformat its main issues and determining factors. The authors examine the concept of cultural policy, the interdependence of politics and culture, where the political sphere is considered a product of cultural and social life, or in other words, where politics is a form of cultural existence. The authors describe the previous political science research concerning culture and the phenomenon of cultural policy where culture is considered the main mechanism of socializing an individual (Goloborodko, 2012). They also examine a cultural policy as an instrument reflecting the social and political systems' relationships. The authors explore the concept of national security and ways to ensure that national interests are protected within the systems of both Russia and international affairs. It is noted that in recent years, the problems of culture and cultural policies, as factors of national security, have drawn crucial public and scientific attention, substantiating reasons for increased effort on the humanitarian issues of national security. The authors conclude that the culture accumulated in the political sphere could influence the regulation of social development and ensure a stable public and political existence.

DT Article
DE cinematography of the 1930-s; Soviet national policy; Kamchatka region;
   A. Litvinov
AB The article seeks to explore the first fiction sound film on Kamchatka ("Girl from Kamchatka", A. Litvinov, 1936) as a visual and ideological construct of the remoted and exotic region in the Soviet epoch. This aim frames new research questions that address the historical and political circumstances for this popular fiction film creation, the film representation in media, the debate about the standards of scenario as well as construction on screen the ideological image of the region. The theoretical foundations of the research include methodology of constructivism (because the image of the region on screen resonated with the ideological construct, and Soviet filmmakers attempted to "popularize" the remote and unknown territory among Soviet citizens), and cultural, and historical analysis. The article focuses on the film of Aleksandr Litvinov, nicknamed 'Russian Flaherty', who played a prominent role in establishing the expedition film practice in the Soviet Union and constructing of visual images of the Soviet Far East. The research based on previously unpublished archival material of Kamchatka, Primorye, and Sverdlovsk region. Analyzing sources related with "Girl from Kamchatka", authors came to the following conclusions. Throughout the 1930s, the Soviet film industry was actively engaged in developing particular images, which refashioned the way audience saw their own and other territories. Film "Girl from Kamchatka", on the one hand, elaborates a set of lasting visual topoi, describing the composite natural and cultural diversity of the region. On the other hand, the film of A. Litvinov is a valuable contribution to historical studies, because it reflects the parallels in the Soviet cultural policy, cinematography, and media. "Girl from Kamchatka" offers rich insights into evolution of the cinematographic representation of Kamchatka, from its picture as a distant and unknown region with borderland status, the so-called terra incognita, towards the developed region under Soviet-inspired changes. In fact, the film "Girl from Kamchatka" situated the area of Kamchatka within the broader Soviet universe. The Litvinov' s case demonstrates that films of the 1930s in the Soviet Union provide insight into conceptual and discourse taming of the frontier regions as well as their full symbolic "inventing" and including in perception of the new Soviet state. The film of A. Litvinov also played a prominent role in publicizing and promoting the new Soviet heroicized role model.

   RISK CAUSING SOCIAL DISTRESS AMONG OLDER AGE GROUPS
SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL POLICY STUDIES
LA Russian
DT Article
DE older age; alcoholism; social policy towards older people; risk factors
   of social disadvantage of aging
AB The article analyses the role of alcohol consumption as a risk factor increasing social disadvantage among older age groups. Firstly, the problem of alcohol abuse among the elderly is considered with reference to the major sociopolitical international and Russian documents. These documents outline the key elements of state policies and the instruments in use, which aim to keep a rapidly growing elderly population healthy, thus reducing the burden on the health system and social security and employment. Particular attention is paid here to the problem of alcoholism among the elderly. Based on the results of empirical studies of the lifestyles of 713 of people aged 60 to 89 in the Arkhangelsk region, this paper offers an evaluation of the impact and consequences of alcoholism, which can be viewed as a destabilizing mechanism in social life settings. The main difficulties in that respondents highlighted that, directly or indirectly, led to alcohol use were the limitation of activities caused by the reduction or disability, loneliness, inadequate social skills, social isolation, lack of physical activity. Thus, consumption of alcohol can be understood as a 'withdrawal' from one's accumulated problems. Loneliness as a manifestation of social exclusion is one of the most dangerous stimulants towards alcohol use among the elderly, which can be seen as a form of 'doping'. The frequency with which alcoholic beverages are consumed depends on gender and age characteristics, as well as education level. Another important factor to be considered is the consequences of the alcohol consumption of older persons as an important risk factor for social disadvantage at the macro-, micro-social and personal levels. The results obtained here update regional studies on the life quality of the elderly population in the regions, revealing a high risk of alcoholic consumption, as well as the development of social policies due to the demographic development and the increase in the availability of medical care for the elderly.

DT Article
DE Historical sources; Perestroika; sociological surveys; public opinion;
   political attitude; Perestroika process; Gorky region
AB Drawing on new archival material from the fonds of the State Social and Political Archive of the Nizhny Novgorod Region that is being thus introduced into scientific use, the article analyzes the formation of socio-political attitudes of the Soviet citizens in the days of Perestroika (1987-1989) in a case-study of the Gorky Region. Data of three sociological surveys conducted in order to study public opinion and activism and to group citizens according to their political views is presented and summarized. The surveys findings allow to identify several specific features of the process of socio-political self-definition. The level of political astuteness was insufficient, only a small percent of citizens (about a quarter of respondents) were able to identify their political beliefs. In 1987-1989, amid the sweeping changes, people faced declining living standards and, unpredictable economic processes; they lost their focus and felt anxiety and confusion and had little thought to spare to political self-definition. Socio-economically, data presented in the article demonstrates strong social anxiety among citizens, who were striving (first and foremost) for socio-economic stability and predictability; it shows deterioration of living conditions, decline of living standards, and dim outlook. The data of the surveys conducted by the Gorky sociologists in 1987-1989 is undoubtedly a valuable source, allowing to reconstruct the formation of public opinion and political attitudes of the Gorky region citizens in the days of Perestroika. The number of respondents is deemed sufficient to arrive at results reflecting the reaction of the population to the Perestroika process in the Gorky region (453 Gorky residents and 264 regional residents took one of the surveys) and to judge them typical for the era.

AB The article is devoted to the current problem of student and youth protest actions that took place in South Africa in 2015-2017. The author shows their influence on the political life of the country. The socioeconomic and ideological reasons for the initiation of the student riots are analyzed. The connection of protests with the general crisis of higher education in South Africa is traced. The study is based on the analysis of the South African print media of recent years. The author analyzes main events and results of the protests that took place in the autumn of 2015, the aggravation of the situation in the sphere of higher education in connection with the student riots in the autumn of 2016, and the unsuccessful attempt to hold the Higher Education National Convention in March 2017. These events became the stages of the movement "Fees must fall" for the abolition of universities fees. The author evaluates the participation of modern youth and student parties and associations in the protests. It is noted that youth and student protests are used by the left and radical parties of the South African political spectrum in the struggle for influence in the country.

AB The role of women in the activities of socio-political associations of indigenous peoples of Yakutia in the late 20th century is considered. It is pointed out that the relatively high position of women in traditional societies in the North predetermined their high role in social processes. Particular attention is paid to the conditions in which the Northern aborigines found themselves during the period of industrial development of the territories of their traditional residence. The author notes that the modernization of the socio-economic way of life of the peoples of the North with the intervention of the state is marked by negative trends towards the loss of their way of life and ethno-cultural heritage. Placed in an unequal position with the non-indigenous population, representatives of aboriginal ethnic groups were forced to adapt to changing living standards. At the same time, the greatest adaptability was demonstrated by women, whose commitment to education and higher social activity and mobility predetermined their predominant role in public life. This phenomenon became most noticeable at the end of the 20th century, when the collapse of the Soviet political system made it possible to defend their rights through ethno-cultural movements and associations. The article was prepared by the order of the Union of women's organizations of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) within the project "Women of the North: Realization of Social Potential in Yakutia".

AB Data on known Dagestan religious and political figure of the 19th century - the Sufi Sheikh Abdurakhman-Haji as-Suguri - found in the Arabic collection of Sufi biographies "Khikaya va manaqib al-Mashaikh an-naqshbandiyina" by Sharafaddin al-Kikuni are considered. The authors of the article translated the fragments of the section of this work. On the example of the analysis of this information, an attempt is made to study the biography of a famous historical figure in the context of the narrative about the surreal events that took place in his life. In the course of work on the text, details are revealed that clarify previously known facts from the biography of a famous religious figure who played an important role in the spread of Sufism ideology in Dagestan. The authors raise the question of the expediency of using the revealed information in research works as a historical source. The textual, historical and philological analysis of the above-mentioned work by Sheikh Sharafaddin al-Kikuni is carried out. Attention is paid to the interpretation of the hagiographic components of the Sufi text, which are closely intertwined with well-known episodes from the biography of Abdurahman-Haji as-Suguri. The researchers conclude that the information about Sheikh as-Sughuri, given in the collection, deserve the attention of experts in various fields of humanitarian knowledge: philologists, historians, religious scholars, ethnographers, etc. Its consideration is important for the study of social, religious and cultural life of Dagestan society of the late 19th - early 20th centuries.

AB The article provides an overview of the "critical terrorism studies" (CTS), an interdisciplinary field of research that was formed in the 2000s. at the intersection of philosophy, political science, and history. The goal of its followers is to problematize the nature of terrorism and its evolution in the XX c. Starting from the critical theory and poststructuralism of Michel Foucault, CTS analyze the mechanisms for constructing the border between the state policy of terror, colonial uprisings, as well as a wide range of "new terrorism" phenomena, ecoterrorism, cyberterrorism, counterterrorism and peacekeeping operations. Especially representative for understanding this new line of research is the "Routledge Handbook of Critical Terrorism Studies" (ed. R. Jackson, 2016). Its analysis allows us to outline the prospects of CTS, as well as the internal contradictions and theoretical differences of its supporters.

AB This paper focuses on the term "geopolitical leadership". With the world geopolitical landscape becoming more complex as the bipolar (or even tripolar) world order is setting in world politics and economics, the need for true global leaders is becoming more urgent. Quite often, it becomes important to look out of the box of the national interests and to see the global picture, and very few individuals can actually achieve that.
   The paper reveals the features of a geopolitical leader, differences and similarities of a political leader, as well as the factors leading to the transformation of a national political leader into a global geopolitical leader. Some relevant examples reflecting on the current world affairs are presented and analysed in greater detail.
   Moreover, the paper reveals the levels and types of geopolitical leadership and well as the main structural components and indicators of geopolitical leadership. In addition, we place the geopolitical leadership into the basis of the current geopolitical process and provide relevant examples from history and politics that might illustrate our points.

AB In the first months of the new political season, which began after the March 2018 Presidential Election, the Government adopted and is currently discussing measures that received a very negative response from Russian society and many experts, especially against the background of election campaign promises and long-term goals of internal development that Vladimir Putin set out in his Address to the Federal Assembly on March 1, 2018. The greatest public response was caused by a draft law on raising the retirement age, although it should be noted that it is not the only one in the list of controversial administration decisions that bring to the fore the issue of compliance of state policy with the national interests or, in other words, the legitimacy of the government. The paper discusses scientific, theoretical and historical foundations of the legitimacy of the government. We present data on Russian national and regional studies of public opinion, indicating Russians' growing discontent with the first steps of the Government in the new political season coinciding with Putin's last (according to the Constitution of the Russian Federation) presidential term. We provide calculations and opinions of experts from various fields of science and social activities proving the ill-considered and contradictory management decisions of recent months, which create conditions for a potential decrease in Russians' trust in the President and, in general, for the aggravation of the socio-political situation in the country.

AB In this article based on the use of the comparative legal research method (internal and external) the constitutional legal nature and the inherent features of the status of Canadian Indians and their settlements are studied. On the basis of the historical-legal method, the genesis of the institutionalization of legal status of the Indians in the context of the implementation in Canada of trends and forms of equating them is studied. The dialectical method is involved in identifying identities and contradictions between constitutional-legal approaches to regulating the status of Indians among themselves, as well as settlements in relation to the provinces and municipalities of Canada, the concept of territorial autonomy. The relevance of the topic is determined by the feasibility of studying the Canadian experience for its possible consideration in the legal regulation of the status of the indigenous peoples of Russia. The novelty of study is predetermined by a certain lack of relevant materials in Russian legal science on constitutional-legal problems of regulating the statuses of Indian, Indian settlements. In addition, for the first time, the constitutional-legal status of Indian settlements was analyzed from the perspective of the concept of territorial autonomy. According to the results of this work, the author substantiates the principle expediency of consolidating the status of indigenous peoples in the form of a self-government regime in the national constitution, within the framework and on the basis of which an adaptive regulatory and legal system could later be developed more productively. With regard to Canadian statehood, it should be noted the regulation of the constitutional and legal status of Indians is carried out not only by federal law and agreements between the federal government and the Indian communities, but also by provincial legislation and acts of Indian groups, which often cause conflicts. Attention is drawn to the more successful experience of the institutionalization of the judicial authorities of the American Indian community. The criteria for determining territorial autonomy formulated in the scientific literature are analyzed. It is noted that with the formal application of these criteria to the constitutional- legal statuses of Indian settlements in Canada, one could state their belonging to territorial autonomies of a political type. At the same time, this approach does not quite accurately reflect the institutional correlation of Indian settlements and territorial autonomies. The author puts forward his own version of identification of intra-state entities as territorial autonomies, on the basis of which it is stated that Indian settlements can be qualified as territories with signs of limited autonomy. Such a conclusion is due to the lack of resources for the implementation of their powers, guarantees of independence and non-intervention of the federal authorities. As a possible conceptual tool for improving the constitutional- legal status of Indian settlements, the rationality of using the institution of territorial autonomy is emphasized.

AB The article deals with the attitude of Russian conservative (right-wing) publicists to the economic situation in the Caucasus and Transcaucasia during the reign of Emperor Nicholas II. The novelty of the study is seen in the fact that the economic development of the region is firstly considered through the prism of the views of the Russian right-wing movement, always paying special attention to this outskirts of the Russian Empire. The article highlights the right-wing's views on the influence of the national-religious factor on the economic situation in the Caucasus. It is shown that the conservative circles attached great importance to the economic situation of Russian settlers and measures to raise their number and welfare. Attention is paid to the views of conservative circles on the dominance of foreign companies in the oil industry of the region. It is concluded that the economic policy in the Caucasus and Transcaucasia was considered by the right-wing first of all from the standpoint of nationalism, and their economic ideas were subordinated to political attitudes. It is shown that, being in the right opposition to the national and economic policy of the Russian authorities in the Caucasus, the conservatives were not able to offer detailed alternative programs that can change the situation according to their ideas about the benefits of this region.

DE Stereotypes in Mass Communications; Intercultural Communication; Image
   of a Country; interdisciplinary approach; interactive methods of
   teaching and learning
AB Rapid changes in mass communication mean that we have to look for new effective ways of studying and teaching international journalism. There are many questions as, for instance: Should we abandon the classical methods of education, for example, lectures? What does interdisciplinary approach mean for learning and teaching modern journalism? What kind of methods should we use in studying and teaching?
   We are trying to answer these questions using a case-study: our own experience in creating and teaching a course for foreign Russia-learners whose fields are mass communication (mainly Journalism and Public Relations), international business, political science, as well as other liberal arts and humanities.
   Since 2010, at the Department of Mass Communication, Faculty of Philology at the Peoples' Friendship University of Russia in Moscow, we have been teaching different courses in the framework of Master's degree programme on Applied International Journalism.
   Modern trends in the development of convergent journalism require new approaches in teaching students. One of them is an interdisciplinary approach. Using and applying an interdisciplinary approach, which is based on the theoretical and practical knowledge of different disciplines, such as psychology, sociology, linguistics, cultural studies and others, to teaching and learning International Journalism allows to enrich critical thinking and cognitive abilities of the students and provide them with a holistic view of the subjects they are studying and moreover, to the problems existing in the modern world.
   Methodology and results.
   We used different methods from general scientific ones, such as analysis and synthesis, and special methods of humanities and social research.
   Firstly, the method of descriptive analysis to present brief contents and main ideas of the courses mentioned.
   Secondly, a typological method that allowed us to compare different scientific opinions of the lecturers reading the courses presented.
   Thirdly, methods of generalization to reveal common issues in learning and teaching International Journalism.
   Findings show, that professional university education implies its fundamental nature, serious study of a number of general theoretical disciplines, humanitarian and social training.
   At the same time, it is very important along with basic and specialized courses on theory and practice on journalism to include in the programme on media education such important applied disciplines and courses as 'Stereotypes in Mass Communications', 'Intercultural Communication', 'Image of Country', and others.
   In English, working with mostly non-English speakers who have completely different educational background, we have drawn a conclusion that traditional methods of education, for example, long academic lectures are not always effective.
   Our main conclusion is for effective ways of studying and teaching International Journalism, as well as other areas of mass communication, there is a need to use a complex of interactive, entertaining, as well as thought-provoking methods. Not only a university venue, but also the Internet, museums, theaters, cinemas, as well as other places and channels have become the modern platforms for effective university education.

DE Somali students in the USSR; SDR; adaptation; African students in the
   Soviet Union
AB First students from Somali Republic arrived to the Soviet Union in 1961 as a result of launching the programme of Soviet scholarships for students from Asian and African developing countries. Thus the Soviets promoted communist ideas across the world through the minds of Asian and African students. In the beginning of 1960s the Soviet Union took an advantage of acquiring its strategic and ideological position in the Horn of Africa using European and American rivalry in the region. At the time the Soviet knowledge of Somali realities was quite limited and mostly theoretical. Political environment in the USSR in the beginning of 1960s had a great impact on the relations between Soviet citizens and Somalis students as well as it opened advantages and disadvantages of the Soviet education and Soviet ideology at the time.

DE International project; collaboration; creativity; competitiveness;
   culture; communication; technological advances; cultural similarities
   and differences
AB Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) is the University which trains students from different parts of the world for work on a global international level, and different schools (Schools of International Relations, Journalism, Economics, Law, Political Sciences, Regional Management, Sociology, Ecology, etc.) reflect specializations and the future areas of graduates' employment. MGIMO-University has an extensive net of university-partners around the world for joint educational programs (master's programs, student and professor exchange programs, etc.). International projects are also part and parcel of collaboration as the international aspect of the educational process is one of the University's priorities.
   This article focuses on the international projects realized at English Department.3, School of International Journalism for the last six-seven years, and the overall analysis of their contribution to the study. The projects ("It's a Small World", "MGIMO-Musashi Exchange program", "Let Us Get Acquainted!" and others) involved students from France, the USA and Japan representing different continents, areas of students' specializations and levels of English. The more valuable and of a more practical significance are the conclusions made and the results achieved.
   Despite all unexpected difficulties that may arise in the course of collaboration (technical malfunctions, time difference, misunderstandings, the incompatibility of the computer programs in two countries, sometimes failures in getting information across to the other side of the communication line about upcoming holidays), international projects create a global context and project possible collaboration on a global scale, which ignites students' creativity, competitiveness and motivation to learn.
   Among the benefits brought about by joint projects are the following:
   1 Competitiveness, which becomes a powerful impetus to students' creativity and learning;
   2 Comprehensive learning which includes explicit and/or implicit ways of exploring their own and peers' cultures and discovering cultural similarities and differences;
   3 Breaking stereotypes about yourself and the culture of international peers;
   4 Comparison and contrast of styles and manners of communication in two or more cultures, possible complexes and psychological problems in communication nurtured by societies;
   5 Adjustability students demonstrate in sharing the same behavioral and linguistic codes in order to attune to successful communication;
   6 Awareness of the latest technological advances in the collaborating countries;
   7 Finding the most efficient means of communication, not exclusively verbal (a pictorial one, slides and graphics, PP presentations);
   8 Setting a model for the peers to follow - in social or charitable work or other fields;
   9 Establishing bridges for a more efficient communication in the future;
   10 Developing cooperation and professional contacts for further collaboration among professors.

AB The article analyzes the stages of social campaigns organization and holding in the further-flung Siberia that aimed at giving material support to the people in hardships and at gathering the population around the new government. The period under study (the first half of the 1920s) bears a special interest thanks to the newly-formed Soviet welfare system character which was determined by political, economic and ideological factors. Studies of Soviet social policy during the complicated post-Revolutionary period allow better understanding of contradictory Soviet reality. Documents from the State Archive of Krasnoyarsk Region and published resources let us reveal the fact that numerous issue-related social campaigns represented a specific way of collaboration between the state and the public institutions; social support measures carried out through organization and holding thematic events touched upon a wide range of problems (maternal and child welfare, children famine relief, disabled and Red Army soldiers welfare). These measures coincided with the declared social policy basic directions. They were conducted in a resource-constrained environment (financial as well as human) in the sphere of social care and service. Although held in Yenisseyskaya Province quite often, the campaigns did not achieve desired result, and financial takings were insignificant. However, they managed to gain the experience of the campaigns conduct and to form a core group among the social care sub-units that supported all the governmental initiatives. Working by campaigns as a way of acute problems solution carried out educational function as well by showing the progressiveness of the taken measures and the humanism of the Soviet State to the citizens. Social campaigns conducted during the period in question played a significant part in the development of welfare system to the population in hardships in Yenisseyskaya Province. The formation of state welfare institutions and mass public organizations finished by the mid-1920s. They organized the registration of the population in need for state support and established the paternalistic assistance measures.

AB The author examines the activities of the Chaun cultural base (kultbaza), which operated in Chukotka in 1933-1940. The author considers the theoretical bases of the cultural bases project. The idea of the project was based on the populist views of ethnographers and officials of the North Committee and had a complex humanitarian focus. On the example of the work of Chaun cultural base, the author shows the practical implementation of the project, reveals the reasons for its inefficiency. The author concludes that the cultural bases in the North were in a situation of double clamping. On the one hand, they experienced the pressure of everyday reality, which did not coincide with the original ideas and plans. On the other hand, local administrations exerted strong pressure on the cultural bases, controlled their work and imposed their political line. Chain kultbaza could not actively collectivize reindeer herders, and therefore was heavily criticized.

AB In the Russian Caucasian studies the medieval period of history of the peoples of the Alazan valley is still one of poorly designed problems. Low degree of knowledge, limitations of the data, the researchers creates certain difficulties. For the expansion of historiographical material in this publication, we first try to characterize the political events in the Alazan valley XVI in a survey by a Turkish author F. Kirzioglu. In his scientific research "The conquest of the Caucasus by the Ottomans (1451-1590)", published in 1993 in Ankara, by the "Turkish historical society", the author refers to data from the State archive of the Turkish Republic and gives interesting data on ethno-political and socioeconomic development, not only of this region but of the whole of the Caucasian isthmus, with the second half of the XV century till the end of XVI century.

AB The increased importance of the religious factor, which influences various aspects of social life, has made it relevant for current academic research. The interrelation of this factor with the political history of Russia makes it one of the most complex and priority areas in the confessional policy of the State, and provokes the rethinking of Russia's policy in the national regions. The issues related to the relationship between official authorities and Orthodox organizations in polyconfessional regions with a predominance of Muslim populations, particularly in Dagestan are of particular interest for us. The absence of historical interpretations on the history of Orthodox organizations in the transitional and post-Soviet periods makes the stated subject topical for identifying and introducing into scientific circulation a specific material that regional studies can provide. Proceeding from the above, in the proposed paper for the first time in regional historiography we've made an attempt to consider the transformation processes in the socio-political situation in the country during the transitional and first decade of the post-Soviet period (1985-1997) and their influence on the development of the Orthodox religion, Christian believers and clergy in Dagestan.
   We've made conclusion about the latent process of religious orthodox revival in the republic against the background of the general spiritual crisis in the country during the transitional period of history, conditioned by the continuing policy of "state atheism". Atheistic worldview of governing bodies often influenced the process of building relationships with religious organizations and was characterized as "ambiguous". Religious renaissance in the first half of the 1990s in Dagestan had its own local features, due to the deterioration of the socio-political background of the republic and was accompanied by factors that adversely affect the position of Orthodoxy here.

AB By resorting to a massive amount of archival materials that was never published before the author aims to reconstruct the major transformations that occurred in the system of higher historical education and science over the decade of Khrushchev's "Thaw" (mid 1950s - mid 1969s). In Siberian archives the author found and introduced into research circulation documents of regional and primary party organizations, state institutions and higher education institutions of Siberia. Reconstruction was made on the basis of a Siberian research and educational complex, which is unique in terms of its history and development. Siberia was a peripheral region in relation to research and educational processes going on in the USSR, which made for some peculiarities in political and ideological development as well as socio-cultural development during those years. The significance and relevance of the subject-matter is accounted for by the special place and role which the higher historical education and historical science had in the Soviet period during the process of forming and reforming the main political, ideological and socio-cultural systems of the Soviet state and society. During "the Thaw" period historians became the most active participants in the de-Stalinization of higher school, on the one hand, and, on the other, their professional activity was subject to strict party and state control and to active pressure, which would have most serious consequences. At Siberian higher education institutions those consequences were specific both for history teaching and for historical research. Last, but not least, they had a decisive impact on the lives of many teachers and students.

TI ECONOMIC TERMINOLOGY IN THE DOCUMENTS OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF TUVA

DE State Archives of the Republic of Tuva; People's Republic of Tuva;
   Resolutions of the Cabinet of Ministers of the PRT; archival documents;
   economy; economic terms; Latin script; Tuvan language; Russian language
AB The article analyzes the terminology of economics as it appears in the documents of the People's Republic of Tuva (PRT, 1921-1944) preserved at the State Archives of the Republic of Tuva.
   The Archives hold the unique collection of over 6000 documents dating back to the PRT. One of the features of book-keeping under the PRT was the parallel use of three languages in different scripts - Old Mongolian, Tuvan and Russian. Prior to 1930, texts in Tuvan were written in Latin script, and since 1941, in Cyrillic.
   The rise of the PRT was a complex process informed by both longstanding historical preconditions and the new political situation. The young state had to build its own system of governance which would help the society achieve sustainability both ideologically and economically. The Soviet Union provided comprehensive assistance to the PRT. Large-scale reforms in every sphere of life, the rise of new branches of economy, industrial production, new forms of business, the arats' (nomadic farmers) transition to sedentary life, the establishment of the national bank, the introduction of taxation and of the aksha (PRT's currency), as well as the new organs of public administration, helped reinvigorate lawmaking in order to regulate the new political and economic relations, and also to introduce a whole set of new terms and notions. This systemic change contributed to the arrival of a new business style in communication, which now had an important economic constituent.
   Economic terminology finds its way into the documents of such bodies of public and state administration as the Cabinet of Ministers, the Small Khural or the Ministry of Finance. Analyzing their resolutions, decrees, circular letters and other documents has allowed us to systematize the terminology into three categories: words of Tuvan origin, words combining Russian/Tuvan or Tuvan/Russian elements, and finally, Tuvinized Russian words.
   The potential use of archival documents of the PRT as sources for studying the development of its economy and finance during the period is far from exhausted and can form the basis of further research. The author believes that the economic terminology which appeared in the days of the PRT could be revived and reintroduced onto the pages of contemporary documentation, thus expanding the boundaries of present-day business Tuvan.

AB The article discusses the influence on the political processes that took place in Russia in the early XX century, the two leading opposition forces, liberals and moderate socialists. Despite the differences dividing them, the work of both these areas has led to the triumph of the Russian revolution. But the actions of liberals and moderate socialists, respectively, behind the success of February and the subsequent development of the revolution, led to tragic consequences for Russia, not excluding complete disappearance of the country from the map. The destructive phase of the revolution was interrupted by the arrival of the Bolsheviks to power in October. Although the Bolsheviks were the most radical revolutionary party, in the chaos of 1917 objectively they had to play a counterrevolutionary role and prevent the collapse of the Russian state.

AB Process of reforming of local governments in the cities of Siberia in the conditions of revolution is investigated (March October, 1917). It is established that in the city centers there was "multiple authority": interim committees of public safety, City Councils (people's assemblies), Councils of working, soldier's and country deputies "the diarchy paradigm" isn't confirmed: in many cities instead of a diarchy dispersion of the power was observed, in the separate centers it was succeeded to avoid public polarization, to keep priorities of the central government. A number of problems when carrying out local elections is noted. The conclusion is drawn that the socio-political instability and systematic changes in local governments have negatively affected the solution of the vital issues of development of municipal economy.

AB Rest along with work is the fundamental basis of the existence of civilization, society and every single person. In socio-economic, political and psychological aspects it defines the specific features of consumer behavior of people.
   The paper deals with the theoretical questions of existence, the social structure and values of rest. They are considered as a reflection of the material and spiritual essence of human life. The thought of upgrading the ideas of the role of human rest in modern science is advanced. The concepts of the real perfect and fair rest are based on the axiological approach. The results of rest theory development are presented.
   The phenomenon of rest in human activity was formalized as follows: rest = natural-natural relaxation + socially conditioned recreation. It defines the term of rest that represents its dialectical unity with labor, the entirety in form and in content along with the complexity of manifestation in the life activity of man and society, the ability to satisfy utilitarian and creative requirements for survival.
   The issues of formation of the value system and motives of social justice of rest are considered. New scientific concepts of rest theory are introduced: rest, the social structure of rest, rest development history in Earth's civilization, the values of rest, the life support of rest, etc. The concepts of the real perfect and fair rest are based on the axiological approach.

DT Article
DE salvation markets; sacred; post-secular; "We"-groups; cosmopolitanism;
   homogeneity; border of political community; Aristotle; Carl Schmitt
AB The article offers an exposition of the range of topics discussed at the events of the Centre for Fundamental Sociology at the National Research University Higher School of Economics in 2017-2018. These topics were generally connected with the basic theme of the return of the sacred to the world of late modernity which seemed to be completely secularized long ago. Special emphasis is given to the role the state plays in this process of the political rehabilitation of the transcendent. The statement of the problem starts with the analysis of significant structural changes within the global discursive landscape, including the demise of the leading role of triumphalist globalization narratives which, until recently, dominated the sphere of values and symbolic meanings. Then it raises the question of the return of the state as an operator of worldly, secular salvation, which, through its institutions, ensures the inclusion of the social world into the transcendent one, thereby defining the circle of those to be rescued. A short historical-philosophical excursus then demonstrates the rooted-ness of the problem of borders of communities in solidarity united by certain transcendent values in the tradition of social science since the times of antiquity. The next section, appealing to the Aristotelian understanding of the political, proposes a participatory model of the mutual recognition for the members of a certain "We"-group structurally separated from other historically-contingent communities of fate. By conceptual means, the article offers an analysis of the attempts to overcome the inevitably discrete character of social ontology undertaken by universalist discourse through the return to cosmopolitan utopias such as projects of global citizenship, post-national inclusive politics, etc. Finally, the text proposes a reconstruction of the alternative line of argumentation usually associated with the names of Aristotle and Rousseau, but explicitly developed by Carl Schmitt. In this line of reasoning, homogeneity is postulated as a condition of the possibility for any community of solidarity. The article offers preliminary conclusions on the relevance of this topic to the theory of social order.

DE Urals; taxation; NEP; private entrepreneurship; confiscation; law
AB This article aims to study the process of organising a campaign with the purpose of collecting arrears from private entrepreneurs and for clearing of tax bureaucracy.
   The source of the research is the instructions of the Central Headquarters of the working team for the patronage over the USSR People's Commissariat for Finance and the administration of Sverdlovsk Regional Financial Administration concerning the Sverdlovsk Regional Financial Department (SRFD).
   The author studies the problems of adequacy of private sector taxation under the SRFD policy. This policy was one of the reasons for organising a tax campaign. The analysis of documents allows the author to conclude that the methods and means of the campaign planned testify to a radicalisation of the policy of a total and final exclusion of private sector from the country's economy, and to the abolition of the NEP mixed economy.
   Apart from fiscal aims proper, the authorities purposed political ones too; their goal was to demonstrate the determination of the government and to conduct a cleaning up of the financial body which was 'littered' with petty-bourgeois elements. To maintain the class equality of the campaign, factory workers were actively involved which led to several legal and organisational problems and caused various instances of abuse. Rapid and unexpected mass confiscations at night which happened without prior notice and on a wide scale, with arrears collected even from relatives and acquaintances of an entrepreneur were similar to a war campaign, resembling an act of intimidation targeted at political opponents. Some points of instructions contradicted the legislature of the time in question; however, this fact was not viewed as a flaw considering the political character of this campaign.
   The rightful desire of the government to collect arrears under the dictatorship of proletariat and under the final stages of the NEP was transformed into a force operation accompanied by the deprivation of property of the conquered class in the spirit of the theory of 'primary socialist accumulation'

AB In context of reviewing several Sustainable Development Goals through the mechanism of UN High-level Political Forum in 2019, the purpose of this paper is to enrich the dialogue on the interconnection and mutual influence between different goals in the example of Goals 4, 8 and 10 relating to migration and education. Both migration and education can be found in the Declaration, and goals and targets, specifically. The issues of migration and education are intertwined in many aspects. The three points were chosen from the many mentioned in the development agenda, which are the access of migrant children to education, the quality of that education in context of integration problems faced by children and educational systems and education in the field of migration, and academic migration. As an illustration to the problems raised, the experience of the Russian Federation is taken, as this country is in the top-list of migrants receiving states for years. Education on migration is taken at the example of the most settled part of migration sphere in law, which is the refugee law, with the links between theory and clinical experience of law students. Finally, the academic migration is touched upon through concepts of "brain drain", "brain circulation" and "brain waste".

DT Article
DE Russian History; East-European History; American Russian Studies;
   Historical Politics
AB American Sovietology was formed in the years of the "Cold War" as science, which methodologically aimed at showing the totalitarian character of power structures in the Soviet Union. The image of the enemy in politics was accompanied by an equally negative image of scientific research, first carried out by political analysts and then by historians. Several decades have passed, but much of what was practiced in the 1950s and 1960s remains important and relevant at the beginning of the twenty-first century. The astute manipulation of facts and events is still going on. In this regard, writings by the professor of history of Yale University Timothy Snyder can provide a good example. Snyder is the author of two famous books translated into Russian: "The Reconstruction of Nations" (2003) and "Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin" (2010). His third work, "The Road to Unfreedom: Russia, Europe, America," dedicated to contemporary history from 2010, was published in 2018 by Yale University Press. While the issues and historical periods are outwardly different, all three books reveal one central idea: Russia's history is the history of Russian fascism. Over the years, only the manifestation of fascism has changed, while its basic characteristics have remained unchanged: an expansionistic foreign policy in Europe, and currently in America as well, and on former Soviet territories. This inevitably transfers Snyder's works from the properly historical sphere to the field of the historical politics and political studies.

AB The paper considers the revolutionary events taking place in the Russian Empire at the beginning of the 20th century: from the first Russian revolution of 1905-1907 until the February Revolution of 1917. That period of dual power continued until July 1917. The paper provides the analysis of the Program of the Provisional Government that came to power and examines its economic policy, namely the obtaining of loans and fighting the capital flight. Three crises of the new government led to the October Revolution and the Bolsheviks' taking power. The authors consider political, economic, legal and organizational reasons for the victory of the Bolsheviks.

TI THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC ORDER AND ECONOMISTS
SO JOURNAL OF INSTITUTIONAL STUDIES
LA Russian

DE pragmatism; constructivism; economic methodology; social question;
   economic discipline; the profession of the economists; German
   historical-ethical school; original American institutionalism; economic
   education; the welfare state; values of economists; deliberative
   democracy
AB The author of the review analyses the new book of Vladimir Yefimov "Economic science in question: other methodology, history and research practice" (2016), in which the profession of economists is considered from the point of view, from one side of its immersion in a particular socioeconomic order, and, on the other - its influence on the latter. This is done by analysing profession of university and academic economists as an institution, the rules of functioning of which throughout the history of this profession was determined largely from outside the community of economists. The birth of the profession of economists in the mid-nineteenth century was associated with the emergence of social question, caused by the appearance of industrial capitalism, and three currents of economic thought (classical political economy and later neo-classical economics, Marxist political economy and the original institutionalism offered three different explanations and, therefore, three different solutions to this question. The book outlines the twists and turns of the development of the first and third of these currents, and explains the disappearance, starting from 1950-ies, of the original institutionalism, while the economics in the West and Marxism in the Soviet Union began to serve the interests of the ruling elites and acted as the ideology, not as the science. Scientific economic discipline was presented then only by the original institutionalism, drawing the insights from the historical-ethical school headed by G. Smaller, the philosophy of pragmatism by C. S. Pierce and the concept of person by John. Dewey, was directly involved in the study of economic reality (economic institutions, rules, habits, beliefs and values that guide the behaviour of economic actors) with the help of qualitative research methods (interviews, participant observation, action research). This methodology assumes that actors are competent in specific problematic situations, which means that only they, in cooperation with experts, (not the experts alone, as is the case in elitist democracies) may be in a process of discussion (deliberation) to come to the solution of these problems. Hence V. Yefimov makes an attempt, on the one hand, to restore the original research practice of institutionalism in the form of a historical-discursive and constructivist institutionalism (which will serve as a framework social theory), and, on the other hand, to propose a project of socioeconomic order based on deliberative democracy.

AB The aim of the article is to demonstrate and prove the presence of ideological component in the semantic structure of Russian toponyms, including urbanonyms. A significant part of the meaning of the proper name indicates the culturological and socio-political significance. In the article four groups of hodonyms are highlighted according to the ideological component. The example of the names of Moscow streets shows that the ideological component is closely connected to the communist, religious, and cultural history of the people. The group of names with an implicit ideological component of meaning is of special interest. The rejection of historically formed names and then their return is, in turn, a socio-political act that conceptualizes the paradigm shift of the linguistic consciousness of the people.

DT Article
DE Sergey Konovalov; Oxford; Great Britain; World War II; Russian
   emigration; public sentiment; identity; Soviet-British relations
AB In the article, on the basis of materials from the Special Collections of the Bodleian Library, University of Oxford, the views of Professor Sergey Konovalov and his intellectual circle on the events of the World War II were studied. At the same time, a retrospect into the pre-war years was made, in order to show that the feeling of an impending military catastrophe existed in the circles of Russian emigration already in the late 1930s. The archival documents made it possible to demonstrate some aspects of the everyday life of the Russian diaspora in Great Britain during the Second World War and also Sergey Konovalov's public activity. It was concluded that the Second World War decisively influenced the academic career and the public views of the scholar. In 1945, he became Head of the Department of the Chair of Russian at Oxford University and put a lot of effort into the development of British Slavic studies and Soviet-British academic relations. His turn towards the USSR did not mean reconciliation with communism and political acceptance of the Soviet system. S.A. Konovalov advocated universal humanistic values. The War transformed the usual political images, as the USSR emerged from it as a winner, since it was possible to preserve the statehood, culture and language. The previous distancing from the whole of the Soviet took a back seat, pushing forward an increased reflexion about their "Russianness".

DT Article
DE legal defects; regulatory legal flaw; quality of law; effectiveness of
   law; legal defectology; legal obstacles; legal restrictions;
   administrative barriers; legislative imbalance; neutralization of law
AB Introduction: this paper deals with defects in the regulatory part of the legal regulation mechanism as deficiencies in regulatory and legal matter. Commitment to high quality of legal norms and regulatory acts is a prerequisite for the effectiveness of law and the main requirement to lawmaking. Creating legal uncertainty and being a fertile field for the emergence of many negative legal phenomena, regulatory defects should become an independent subject matter of a new scientific area of legal defectologv. Purpose: to formulate the concept 'regulatory legal defect' taking into account the complexity of defectiveness as a legal phenomenon and its relationship with many other legal categories; to justify the importance of its independent research within the theory of law. Methods: the research is based on the general scientific dialectic approach to cognition of legal defects, which allows for considering this phenomenon in its formation and development as well as in conjunction with related phenomena; other methods applied in course of research include methods of formal logic and specific scientific methods of studying legal reality (formal dogmatic, hermeneutical approach, legal modeling). Results: understanding of regulatory legal defects is in dialectical unity with the concepts 'quality of law' and 'effectiveness of law'. A regulatory legal flaw can be recognized as a defect when it violates the quality standard of law and adversely affects the performance of a legal regulator. Conclusions: the effectiveness of law is influenced by both non-legal factors (political, managerial, financial, social, psychological, ideological) and some legal deficiencies related to defects (restrictions, obstacles, administrative barriers, legislative imbalance, neutralization of law). Regulatory legal defects, mutually determined and interacting with other legal flaws, have their own content and their own conceptual line, reflecting certain shortcomings of the content, form and structure of legal rules and regulatory legal acts.

DE Political consciousness; gender; political involvement; political
   activity; etacratic conditions
AB The paper considers changes and mobilization of women engagement in non-governmental organizations and associations (NGOs). Engagement of women in non-governmental organizations allows the latter to participate actively in public policy. In Russia, the problem is not so much the quantitative presence of women in power structures as absenteeism and deficiency of women engagement. Various development stages of women's NGOs relate to meeting key women interests and their consciousness politicization. At a pre-revolutionary stage, interests of women were focused on professional employment, economic independence, on the access to higher education. The Soviet period was characterized by etacratic conditions where women's NGOs acted as a form of ideological work and political mobilization. Interests of women as a social group were never considered separately; hence women tried to solve problems of their social role (family and childcare, daily routine, etc.). The Post-Soviet period is characterized by a spate of women's NGOs where ideas of equality, political and social reforms are brought to the forefront. Political consciousness of women changes under altered social philosophy. By the late 1990s, positive anticipations had been replaced with apathy and estrangement. The decline in the social and economic status of many Russian families made women's NGOs to reject personal political interests, and focus rather on protection of disadvantaged groups. At present, women's NGOs act as a mouthpiece of various social groups and solve a wide range of issues. Non-governmental organizations face a number of difficulties, including organizational difficulties, underestimation of the need for political involvement, weak resourcing.

DT Article
DE trust; reflexive trust; staged trust; knowledge; validity; reflexivity;
   non-linear de-velopment; uncertainty; risk; security; threat; forecast
AB The article shows that the validity of scientific knowledge being trustworthy is extremely important for ensuring national security. At the same time, there are objective and subjective factors that undermine confidence in it. Among the ob-jective factors is the formation of a reflexive socio-natural reality that acquires a non-linear character of development that, accordingly, implies the formation, of non-linear knowledge based on the transition from the traditional revealing of rigid correlations between facts and phenomena to a theoretical and methodo-logical instruments that can take into account many uncertainties that are manifested in the form of social disruptions, cultural traumas, unintended conse-quences of the innovation human activity. In essence, the instruments for the for-mation of non-linear knowledge is only being created, therefore, "approved, es-tablished" knowledge sometimes comes to the normative documents devoted to Russia's security, but related to previously existing realities and other time creat-ing problems for the scientific forecast of the development of international and military-political relations. If the results of the natural sciences are absolutized and counterposed to the social and human sciences, as well as interdisciplinarity, this also makes the final knowledge vulnerable.
   Subjective factors significantly affect the validity of scientific knowledge. The researchers are inevitably influenced by the features of civilization and culture in which they live and work, the experience of socialization and self-socialization. But the greatest damage to the validity of knowledge is inflicted when national interests are replaced by group interests, especially personal interests of scien-tists.
   These complicating realities demanded a transition from unconditional trust to scientific knowledge to reflexive trust, the concept of which is proposed: this type of trust is based on risk as a certain degree of confidence in the adequacy of the involved theoretical and methodological instruments; as scientific as well as social rationality is considered; a critical test of any theory is assumed; there tak-en into account the factor of staged trust that is spreading in virtual reality; in the validity of knowledge the criterion of its humanistic component is introduced.

DT Article
DE Russia; sociological diagnostics; social and humanitarian expertise;
   humanistic turn; future
AB The author of the article shares his reflections on innovative knowledge, inspired by reading a book by M.K. Gorshkov "Russian society in the context of new reality. To the results and continuation of the sociological mega-project" (Moscow: Ves Mir Publishers, 2017) and some other works - his own and his school. As it is shown in the article, many Russian and foreign sociologists consider the main function of sociology to be the diagnosis of society. A special place in this series is the unique theoretical and methodological instruments for the sociological diagnostics proposed by the Full Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences M.K. Gorshkov that organically combines interdisciplinary and contextual approaches. Its application allowed the investigators to obtain very valid results of Russia's states in the last quarter of the century, on the basis of which a forecast is given for its future that also takes into account the peculiarities of current global and national realities. In this context, the author of the article proposes to reconsider the development strategy of Russian society, its reorientation to the realization of socio-economic tasks and the achievement of humanistic goals of the development of the society. Accordingly, the new management is demanded including the development and reproduction of social and human capital as the most important socio-humanitarian component on the basis of highly developed spheres of science, culture, and education. The diagnostic instruments identify and justify the means of optimizing the social life of Russians among which are: a socio-humanitarian expertise; conditions for free activity of people; the national variant of the democratic system ensuring the reproduction of social trust of citizens in political institutions; the formation of education as a means of countering the challenges for Russia; the humanization of the economy aimed at increasing of social and human capital. The sociological diagnosis that was carried out made it possible to establish a social diagnosis according to which Russian society has become complex, more differentiated and multilayered with a permanent process of technical and socio-cultural renewal while the Russians formed the awareness of their belonging to the European and Eurasian world.

DE Sarmatians; Late Sarmatian culture; western elements; antique import;
   diplomatic relations
AB The Late Sarmatian culture has oriental origin. This culture practically does not have the features of funeral rite, which can be associated with the influence of ancient word. After the middle of the 2nd century AD, imported items of Roman or Provincial-Roman origin began to occur in the Late Sarmatian burials. The most mass category of findings is represented with metal tableware. As a rule, metal, more often bronze, vessels are represented with jugs, basins, strainers and ladles. In some cases, they are found as parts of table set. The burial complexes with such sets are found throughout the territory of the Late Sarmatian culture - from the Trans-Urals to the Northern Azov region. The Sarmatians started to use the import metal tableware later than the inhabitants of the Roman provinces.
   The Late Sarmatian burials also contain the antique vessels made of glass. Such vessels are often found in complexes with metal tableware. A few finds of Roman articulated fibulae with enamels are known in the Late Sarmatian burials in the territory of the Southern Urals and the Trans-Urals. Oriental things are often found in burials along with the Roman things: Chinese, middle-Asian, etc. Roman products often mark graves of high social status, which differ in burial rites from ordinary burials. Findings of things of Roman or provincial Roman origin in high-status burial mounds confirm their value in the Sarmatian society. There are several opinions regarding the penetration of Roman imports into nomadic culture. They could get to the Sarmatian leaders as trophies or as a result of trade relations. Standardization of both sets and types of Roman tableware allows assuming their appearance in steppe monuments of late Sarmatians as political gifts.

DE Thucydides; realism; legal nihilism; international relations
AB The article is devoted to the reception of Thucydides in Political Science. On the basis of the comparative analysis of structural and constructive realism - two traditions in the theory of international relations the author shows that they both treat the Athenian historian to some extent as a "godfather" and appeal to him as an authority. According to the author's conclusion, neither structural, nor constructive realists need references to the "History of the Peloponnesian War" in order to substantiate their ideas. The key difference between structural and constructive realists is the problems that they are trying to resolve through the appeal to the heritage of Thucydides. If structural realists use selected excerpts from the text of the "History of the Peloponnesian War" to confirm and legitimize their own propositions, constructivists insist on the holistic reading of the text. In their interpretation of the text they give pride of place to the norms, values and political rhetoric as independent elements of international relations. The author thinks that the latter approach is both more adequate to interpreting the text and more productive in terms of science. Paying close attention to such phenomena as culture, law and rhetoric allows them to create a more complex, non-reductionist theory of international relations that better fits the realities of the era of mediatization of public policy and "new transparency".

AB In this article, the authors analyze intellectual humility as a cognitive and a communicative virtue. Public discussions on controversial topics - religious and scientific debates included - are becoming an increasingly important part of social life. They are viewed as important for the future of democratic societies as political procedures traditionally associated with democracy. In order to make a public dialogue more beneficial for the society it is essential to understand what obstacles may arise in its way and what the possible strategies to overcome them are. One of such behavioral strategies is intellectual humility. Humility has a long history of being recognized as a virtue. The authors analyze its potential for contemporary societies, undertake etymological analysis and compare intellectual humility to other associated intellectual virtues and vices such as open-mindedness and intellectual hubris. The core point of this article is that prejudiced cognition is bound to become limited or outright false, whereas intellectually humble research and dialogue efforts lead to true understanding - both cognitive and interpersonal. Intellectual humility is perceived as an especially valuable asset for any researcher, administrator or public speaker.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE parliamentary history of Russia; "Political man"; parliament;
   parliamentarians
AB The article deals with the works of historian Igor K. Kiryanov on parliamentary history of Russia. He is one of the founders of parliamentary history as a new direction in modern Russian historiography, contributing to its development through the use of new, interdisciplinary methodological approaches. The research arsenal of Kiryanov contains historical versions of the humanities (political science, anthropology, elitology, etc.), as well as methods of historical information science. Kiryanov's innovation was an attempt to interpret the parliamentary history of Russia in the context of the modernization paradigm through the prism of the theory of "democratic transit". In his opinion, in Russia of the early 20th century, there was "Homo politicus", or "Political man", in the form of "public policy", identified primarily with the deputy of the State Duma. Kiryanov studied not only the genesis and development, but also the failure of the "Russian transit", in connection with which he dwelt on the fate of the parliamentary Romanov monarchy in the early 20th century and the State Duma after the victory of the February revolution in 1917. The classification of the deputies of the pre-revolutionary parliament, made in the context of the historical and anthropological paradigm, is another innovation of Kiryanov, as well as his concept of the correlation between the political everyday life of the State Duma and its electorate. However, Kiryanov's discourse is no stranger to the traditional language, which enables the researcher to build bridges between the "oldZ" and "new" historiography, thereby ensuring the successive, and hence successful, development of Russian historical science at the present stage.

AB The paper analyzes the literature of the post-Soviet period, dedicated to the propaganda work of political veterans of the fronts and armies, as well as commanders, and political workers, party and Komsomol organizations directly in the military, in combat orders of units and party bodies of the Stalingrad region during the battle of Stalingrad. The authors highlight the most topical issues studied in historical works from 1991 to the present. New approaches to the analysis of the content, forms, methods and regional features of propaganda work, the degree of its influence on the life and activities of soldiers and the population in the battle of Stalingrad are characterized. The authors denote the leading subject fields of historiography of Soviet propaganda during the war. This, first of all: 1) agitation and propaganda in the rear of the red Army; 2) political and ideological work in the army and Navy; 3) propaganda activities in the liberated areas; 4) propaganda work in the temporarily occupied by the enemy territories; 5) counter-propaganda among the soldiers of the Nazi army and the German population. The special attention is paid to the questions of "feedback". The Russian historiography has for the first time started to touch upon the everyday life of various social groups of the Soviet population, psychology of the masses and the individual, mass consciousness of the population, growth of religiosity of the population, military personnel, Patriotic spirit of clergy.
   The Great Patriotic War has revealed very clearly the complex diversity of feelings, beliefs and views that distinguish the moral foundations of the patriot. From the beginning of fascist aggression and up to the end of the struggle against Nazi enemies, The Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) had being supported the spirit of patriotism. The authors also consider promising areas for further research on the history of propaganda work of the Soviet state among the soldiers and the population during the battle of Stalingrad.

TI KEEPING THE BALANCE OF POWER IN SOUTH CAUCASUS
SO MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA

DT Article
DE Russia; Armenia; Azerbaijan; the South Caucasus; military-political
   cooperation; arms traffic; balance of power
AB The issue of searching for an effective regional balance of power in the South Caucasus through the prism of Russia's military and political interaction with Armenia and Azerbaijan is examined. The experience of the USA carrying out similar policy in relation to these states is demonstrated. Based on the quantitative analysis of military-political relations between Moscow, Yerevan and Baku, the scale and forms of the cooperation are estimated. Positive and negative consequences of the official Moscow's "balancing" policy are reviewed. Difficulties that the Russian side has to face when implementing such a regional scenario of behavior are shown. The article says that for Russia, which represents itself as a backbone structural element in the CIS, the key to realizing its national interests is creation of a "good-neighbor belt" and counteraction to formation of the anti-Russian buffer zone in the post-Soviet space. This determines the foreign policy course of Moscow in the CIS region, where the Russian leadership strives to maintain a balance in the development of military cooperation with such regional rivals in the South Caucasus subregion as Armenia and Azerbaijan. The authors come to a conclusion that Russia is balancing between two countries - Armenia and Azerbaijan - in order to maintain its influence in the region and the balance of power between the sides. It is noted that Moscow tries to demonstrate the adherence to the principle of a dynamic balance of power maintenance in the South Caucasus. Unfortunately, Russia is not coherent in its political line in contrast to the USA. According to the authors, it is difficult for Russia to maintain the military and political parity between Armenia and Azerbaijan only because of the fact that it is a major weapons supplier for these two countries. So, any destabilization between Yerevan and Baku is not good for Moscow, and it can lead to serious problems regarding its reputation and regional interests. However, despite the fact that Russia has a regional and global status, an alternative political line will not be reconsidered in the near future. Moscow acts according to its age-old experience in the regional policy.

TI PARADOXES OF ARAB POLITICAL SYSTEMS CHANGES
SO MGIMO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Arab political systems; electoral processes in MENA region;
   democratization of the Arab world; non-state actors in MENA; modern and
   archaic in the Middle East
AB This article explores the antinomies of development of different Arab political systems, drawing on the theory of social order by D. North, J. Wallis and B. Weingast. The author analyses all Arab countries as "orders of limited access'', mature or fragile. This approach enables the author to follow the rationale of political development in fragile and failed states, as well as the logic of how political relations form in quasi-states, without raising the question of statehood as such. However, the level of generalization inherent in the theory of social order impedes an analysis of the diverse political reality as we encounter in the Middle East. Therefore, the author (enhances the theoretical framework), identifying three models of political transformation in the Arab world: the Levant-Iraqi, North African and Gulf-Libyan models. Each of these models is organized in its own way, not only in socio-political terms, but also has been developing according to its own logic over the past several decades. In 2010 and 2011, all Arab states were faced with the same, well-known set of challenges and threats. And though responses to these differed case by case and were predetermined by the belonging of a particular system to a particular transformational model, the result was the same: the emergence of drivers of future change, applicable to the entire region.
   From the author's perspective, these drivers have included: first, a kind of "future phobia", which drives the political behavior of both masses and elites; and second, economic crisis, with which most governments of the region have struggled. At first glance, the political transformations occurring as a result of these drivers appear similar. Democratic procedures, electoral processes and the role of civil society appear to have strengthened and play an increasingly prominent role. The paradox is that, in practice, the above-described regional trends can entail very different social-political consequences, presaging modernization in some places, while driving the archaization of the state in others, depending on which model the respective state belongs to. At the same time, these processes of modernization and archaization stand in a complex relationship with the processes of strengthening/weakening of "orders of limited access": while, tactically, the majority of conscious actions taken by elites is aimed at strengthening "orders of limited access", in the long run, such actions can raise risks and weaken political systems.

All of existing methodic and their development and application contexts analysis permitted us to draw a conclusion, that interpretation of modern world transformation needs a new one based on a broad trans-disciplinary convergence. According to J. Topolski W. Wrzosek approach it had been provided with four steps: dialog of methods, effective ones' isolation, finding new methodological base, elaboration and approbation of a new methodic. As U.S. decision-making process is well studied it had been chosen as an subject of the research. Existing methods of analysis demonstrated a necessity for a new theoretical methodological base to transform them into flexible set of researching tools. Principals of mathematical function and modern physical picture of the world in correspondence with political and social world realities had been chosen as the one. The result permitted to elaborate scripted round table methodic. It means preparation of several lists of issues to he analyzed by experts. All of them had been spread among participants of scripted round table. The list of issues to be discussed had been prepared and spread beforehand as well. In accordance with elaborated procedure all the speakers mutually exchanged their papers not later than two days before the gathering. All its participants had been divided to speakers and "experts without paper", who took part in discussion only. It permitted to make the one strict, to form condition for non-standard suggestions to be expressed and to draw an integrated picture combined general trends an unique phenomena's ones.

AB The modern reality with permanently changing socio-cultural, political and social, technical and information conditions offers a new view on education as on the driver of all processes in society. The university as one of the main social institutes is urged to realize axiological tasks: ensuring continuity of cultural traditions, valuable orientation of pupils, introduction of the individual to the world of culture, formation of public and spiritual life of the personality. The modern university shows trinity of systems: education, culture and science. At different stages of historic development of society, within this or that political and economic formation, value-oriented function of university received the differentiated nature of realization. Values are in turn created by a certain, socio-historical practice, used for personal development and achievement of social progress, play the principal role in the course of integration of the socio-cultural system and the personality. It reveals a role of the valuable bases in formation of culture both professional, and university. However, in the conditions of globalization, information oversaturation, a humanization of educational processes, the university gains some traits which are new and initially uncharacteristic for it.

DE CIA; decolonization; Cold War; Third World; the USA; the USSR
AB The paper deals with the approaches to estimating the process of colonial system decay after 1945 by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of the USA. Having drained Europe, World War II provoked a radical turn in the paradigm of international relations that allowed the national movements in colonies to assert themselves. Moreover, the process of decolonization coincided with the Cold War genesis that exerted significant impact on the worldwide policy proceeding from now on in line with opposition of two superpowers and the related military-political blocks.
   The research is based on literature sources on the history of CIA, the history of the Cold War and decolonization process. Special attention is paid to the report Disintegration of colonial empires and its value for safety of the USA being the backbone document for the USA in the issue of finding an optimal solution of the problem of colonial system disintegration in the conditions of opposition with the USSR.
   We've made conclusion that the CIA's estimates were far from the liberal ideals of F. Roosevelt times. The CIA considered the countries of the Third World only as a potential zone of the USSR influence, and held a discussion on strengthening of the USA's influence among the former colonies, at the same time maintaining the relations with their mother countries. We've also laid the foundations for the ethnographic analysis.
   The condition of the organization itself represents another important factor in the CIA's estimates of colonial system. It's been proved that at the early stages of its existence, the CIA had faced a number of problems, such as staff shortage, lack of single-skilled expert, difficulties in ensuring productive interaction of analysts and field investigators, etc. Thus, studying the views of CIA agents on the problem of decolonization is of great interest in the context of history of the Central Intelligence Agency.

AB As a multi-ethnic country, China is concerned with the protection and reservation of the rights and freedoms of ethnic minorities. The rights of ethnic minorities to self-determination are guaranteed in China through the establishment of ethnic regional autonomies, which corresponds to China's domestic strategic interests. China's ethnic policy is aimed at maintaining political stability and the country's territorial integrity, at achieving the integration of Chinese society and the harmonious development of ethnic relations.
   The object of research is the problem of enforcement of the right to national self-determination in the Chinese Communist Party's theory and policy. The research methodology is represented with historical, structural and functional, systemic approaches, and the analysis of literature sources.
   The historiography of the research is represented with the books by the Chinese and Russian scholars (T. V. Lazareva, V.A. Manko, M.Kh. Farukshin) considering different views on the development of ethnic regional autonomy and self-government principles.
   In China, the enforcement of the right to self-determination by ethnic minorities is divided into two stages. The establishment of the right to self-determination was the first stage (from 1922 to 1949), and the process of improving the system of regional ethnic autonomy has been the second stage (from 1949 to the present). The system of regional ethnic autonomy in China is an effective way to solve ethnic problems.

DE Censure; inorodsty of the South of Russia; rulemaking; source; form;

AB The article analyses public censure as a source of regulatory activity of the inorodsty (non-Russian indigenous ethnicities) local authorities in the South of Russia in the 19th - early 20th century. Integration of nomadic peoples in the all-Empire legal and economic sphere made provisions for continuation of some common law institutions. Among these were local self-government bodies. Local self-government activities in indigenous societies incorporate practices of representative democracy within the framework of customary and positive law, as well as interactions between state and society, all of which has much relevance to this day and age. Assembly (skhod) produced public censure that included purview with majority decision. Most sources come from the State archive of Stavropol Region and the National Archive of the Republic of Kalmykia. General and special scientific research methods assess public censure as a source on the history of the inorodsty in the South of Russia in the 19th - early 20th century. The form of sentence was not fixed by law, and yet content analysis of documentary materials from the State Archive of the Stavropol Region and the National Archive of the Republic of Kalmykia concludes that it remained unchanged throughout the 19th - early 20th century. Content of public censure allows to reconstruct the spectrum of issues put before the assembly and to classify them by topic: legal, social, and financial and economic. The author concludes that verdicts of the inorodsty societies of the period, being legal acts of local significance and great information value, are one of the main sources on socio-political and socioeconomic history of the region.

DT Article
DE Viroli; Machiavelli; power; God; religion; virtue; prophet
AB The paper outlines the most essential aspects of Machiavelli's religious concept and analyzes the key interpretations of it. The major ones are republicanism and straussianism. Republicanism emerged during the Enlightenment, while straussianism was developed only in the middle of XX century. Nevertheless, it should be noticed that both interpretations have origins in the Enlightenment because Leo Strauss practically renovate Machiavelli's philosophy criticism of this time. Republicanism declares that Machiavelli is "a founder of republican humanism language", who laid the foundations of the modern republican discourse. On the contrary, straussians blame Machiavelli for anti-religiousness and amorality, stating that Machiavelli's philosophy became indirect cause of all modern political problem. Both research traditions try to analyze Machiavelli's religious thought. Recently republicanism became more influential then straussianism due to works of Maurizio Viroli "Machiavelli" (1998) and "Machiavelli's God" (2010), where he undermines the foundation of straussianism. In this paper the Viroli's interpretation will be considered and we will try to understand, which interpretation is more developed.

Four blocks of questions are considered. The first analyzes the results of the APEC summit in Danang, achieved in spite of the complex international situation of the country. The second shows the contrast between the two political courses presented at the summit by the US and China. The third discloses the doctrine of the "free and open Indo-Pacific region", presented by D. Trump. It is considered as an evidence of the weakening influence of the United States in the region. The final part of the article shows how Vietnam reacts on these initiatives. According to the author the position of Vietnam reflects the policy of renewal, openness and independence based on the "three no" principle.

AB The appearance of the article is inspired by the provisions of the new monograph 'Russia's Foreign Policy. 1991-2016' ed. under supervision of and with Introduction by A. V. Torkunov. The authors of the article continue and further develop the book's comprehensive analysis of main directions of Russia's foreign policy. Stating the demise of the bipolar and the unitability of the unipolar world under the leadership of one country - the United States, the authors warn against euphoria over the current transition to a multi-polar world. They point out that manageability of the emerging world order is deteriorating and new threats to peace and security are arising while the traditional ones remain acute. At the same time, the possibilities for and level of coordination among states to counter these threats are decreasing. Of particular concern is that the political circles of certain countries oversimplify the problem of use of nuclear weapons and cultivate a false sense of confidence in their ability to control escalation in case of such use. The current state of arms control that remains in deadlock is also deeply troubling. Alongside with these developments, the world witnesses expanding influence and growing importance of Russia and China which to a large extent seek to revise the current global balance of power. On the territory of the former Soviet Union, newly independent states create international associations which are expected to eventually cooperate with their Western counterpart institutions. The current aggravation of relations between Russia and Western countries, especially between Moscow and Washington, seriously reduces the opportunities to consolidate the new world order and to enhance international security. However, Russia's orientation solely on the East will weaken its competitive position in the world. The further escalation of confrontation does not serve the long-term interests of key global players.

AB The article is devoted to the development of Russian-Egyptian relations in terms of intercivilizational dialogue; there are analyzed the dynamics of their development in various historical epochs as well as the factors that have had decisive influence on the nature of the bilateral interaction. The globalization processes in which the modern world lives are shaking all the models of national and cultural identity that have developed over many centuries. These processes jeopardize the existence of the peoples, nations and cultures in their present form. In these conditions the inter-ethnic cultural dialogue acquires special significance. This article is devoted to the consideration of a similar dialogue between Russian and Egyptian cultures in which political, economic, cultural, scientific and spiritual ties played and continue to play a special role. The ideas of Leo Tolstoy, M. Gorky and other Russian writers got in Egypt a special popularity and had a significant impact on progressive minds of the Egyptian intelligentsia as well as on the Egyptian literature. Although Arab, in particular Egyptian historians and public figures for a long time considered Russia as part of the West, after the October revolution of 1917 in Russia the Soviet state began to be perceived as a force that opposes the materialistic West. From the fifties of the 20th century, the military-technical and economic cooperation with the USSR, subsequently with Russia is of great importance for Egypt. At the same time, the article analyzes the influence of Egyptian culture and art on the spiritual and intellectual life of Russia.

DE right populism; Christian Churches; Catholicism; Protestantism;
   Orthodoxy; political parties and movements; migration crisis
AB The article analyzes the Christian factor in the political discussions in European countries during migration crisis, which is determined by the reaction of Christian churches to the rising of right-wing populism. The churches are considered as civil institutions with their own social and political positions in the frames of the sociological and political approach. The Christian factor is understood as the institutional influence of the church structures. The author states that from the point of view of secular scholars and publicists the Christian factor is to the great extent instrumental. In order to represent the whole diversity of the political landscape it is necessary to explore at least four dimensions of inter-relations of religion and populism: the positions of the parties and the church "profit" from populism, the church support of populism, the church activity against populism, the populist critics against populism. The conclusion is made that populists using the rhetoric of the "defence of identity" have facilitated the recognition of the Christian factor as significant and political. Balancing between politicians-liberals and politicians-traditionalists church leaders (mainly catholics and protestants) have offered their own programme of preserving the identity (sub-national approach, solidarity, charity) in a world where the missionary and political interests of the churches are represented on different continents.

DE Source; archive; Russian Orthodox Church; World War II; USSR; Nazi

AB Analysis of the previously unknown to the scholarship documents strives to close the gaps in studying unknown facts and events of the history of Orthodoxy in Ukraine in the days of the Great Patriotic War. The article presents new archival sources in order to explore the history of Orthodoxy in Ukraine more fully and objectively. The significance of the publication of these archival documents stems from current processes and state of the Orthodox Church in Ukraine, where it has been exposed to persecution by the political elite of Ukraine. Certain circles of the Ukrainian clergy support the split of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church and its persecution. During the Great Patriotic War religious life in the occupied Ukrainian territories was extremely ambiguous. The Nazi occupiers encouraged the split in the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which resulted in emergence of the Ukrainian Autonomous Orthodox Church, which maintained canonical ties with the Russian Orthodox Church, and Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, which Was non canonical and sought to break all ties with the Moscow Patriarchate. The authors have carried out archeographic and source-studies analysis of the new documents in order to establish their authenticity, time and place of their origin and to determine their novelty and scientific and practical significance. Archival sources identified in the course of documentary project 'Orthodoxy in Ukraine in the days the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945' shed light on the situation, describe numerous killings of priests of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, speak of cooperation of the episcopate of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Church with the occupation authorities. The attempt to create a unified Ukrainian Orthodox Church failed. In spring 1943, the troops of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) opened hostilities against the Nazis, who responded by ceasing all support of their spiritual pillar, the Autocephalous Church. The Moscow Patriarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church only recognized legitimacy of the Autonomous Orthodox Church in Ukraine. After the bishops of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church escaped in the steps of the retreating German army, the Orthodox parishes on the territory of Ukraine passed into jurisdiction of the Moscow Patriarchate of the ROC.

AB The article analyzes the process of formation of national military units of the Red Army among the indigenous Muslims of the Steppe Region and Turkestan during the Civil War of 1918-1922 on the basis of the following sources: legislative acts of the Soviet government, orders and reports of regional party authorities, and commanders of the Eastern and Turkestan fronts. In 1918 and during the first half of 1919, the Bolsheviks didn't achieve a considerable progress with regard to this question. The situation can be explained by a number of reasons. The positive dynamics of the process of forming national military units among the indigenous ethnic groups of the Steppe Region and Turkestan emerged in the first half of 1919 because of the success of the Red Army on the Eastern and Turkestan fronts. Among other important factors in the successful mobilization of Muslims into the Red Army were: large-scale political work and propaganda campaign of the Communist party of Turkestan among the Muslims, the creation of a Muslim faction within the party, defection of the leaders of the Alash party and the Basmachi movement to the Bolsheviks, the formation of the Turkestan and Kirghiz (Kazakh) Autonomous Soviet socialist republics. Therefore, the Bolsheviks opted for the ethnic, rather than confessional principle in creating military units. This tactic logically followed the process of nation building in the region. It took account of the interests of ethnic groups convinced that the presence of military units was a symbol of the national identity and liability for retaining public and cultural independence.

AB The article deals with the problems of historiography of the armed conflict in the Chechen Republic. The author analyzes the approaches to disclosure of the nature and the causes of the armed conflict in Chechnya, existing in modern Polish historiography. The active phase of the military operations of the armed conflict in Chechnya was completed in 2001. At that time, historians, analysts and journalists create a wide range of theoretical works concerning the conflict. A number of common features on the use of basic resources are discussed in these publications. The degree of accessibility of the sources which focus on the description of the conflict and its socio-political assessment is of great importance for researchers and their objectives. Modern Polish historiography, dedicated to the armed conflict in Chechnya, is in the stage of development and the state of its documentary complex is characterized by a number of qualitative changes. The article highlights the scientific and objective truth, comparing it with the comments of the contemporaries. In terms of methodological aspects it is an interesting work for specialists in the fields of history and political science. The author urges us to meditate on the objective truth and subjective opinion about the events. Versions of the causes of the conflict, conflict results and prospects set out in the Polish historiography may have significance not only for understanding of the situation in the Chechen Republic itself but also for the international relations.

   Identity in Comparative View of Postcolonial Studies

DT Article
DE asymmetric conflict; comparative studies; postcolonial studies; national
   identity; British empire; Russian empire
AB Formation of the national identity and designing of the political nation is not only a subject of studying for the contemporary historian, but also essential imperial (on character and in essence) a task for the British and Russian states - as for implementation of imperial projects in the 18th century, and for the successful competition to nationalisms within the empire and beyond its limits in the 19th and 20th centuries. In Russia and Britain during the Modern history the identity, thus, was imperial identity, and in this sense its components gained imperial value and measurement. Among them including images of the Scottish Highlander and Cossack/man of the steppe - at first as constituting "Other" as rebellious "barbarian" as a peculiar inversion of the age of Enlightenment and then as an example of patriotism and a sample of the hero of the empire during an era of preromanticism and romanticism of the second half of XVIII -the first third of the 19th centuries.
   Thus the romanticism was one of the forms of further intellectual colonization of the European outskirts and its inhabitants, still rebellious yesterday, and historical modeling of the asymmetric conflicts between the "barbaric" outskirt and "civilized" political center by means of the historical novel as one of the most important cultural events of the 19th century became the main historic-literary reception in this case. Staying in much in the shadow of Enlightenment, this process reflected the phenomena in the history of the British and Russian social and political thought not less important, than reaction to revolutionary events in France, the Napoleonic wars, judgment of social consequences of an industrial revolution in Great Britain or preservations of a serfdom in the Russian Empire.
   At the same time historical modeling of the asymmetric conflicts typical for imperial suburbs during an era of colonial powers, was carried out not only in the form of the historical novel, but also in the form of historical letter per se. The narrative tradition of the center in this sense represented not only a way of judgment of the past, but also was one of forms of colonial knowledge influencing formation of imperial identity. The post-colonial deconstruction of such compositions on "lessons of history" (about "useful" past to consolidation of the political nation) in comparative view allows to see how there was a process of outskirts integration into an empire body at the rhetorical level, in the sphere of public consciousness, at the level of adoption of concrete political decisions.

AB The article presents the methodology of realization of the public-private partnership mechanism in cultural industry, balanced in terms of the correlation between risks and responsibility. This mechanism will allow to reduce costs, ensure investment and lower the risk level in the industry of culture, thus determining its attractiveness and competitiveness. The objective of the article consists in elaborating the instruments of public-private partnership in cultural industries, which can take legal, organizational and financial forms, having as models methodological, organizational, resource, legislative and motivational support. The directions of the use of public-private partnership are quite multilateral: they include government and political support, organizational-economic and investment-financial conditions, legislative basis and staffing. We have used the methodology of mathematical-economic modeling extended by the functional analysis of the cultural industry in the Russian Federation. The statistical method of the time series analysis of the cultural industry's official rates in 2005-2017 in different countries that has been applied in the research shows the trends from double-digit growth to double-digit fall. The calculation of the criteria weight of public-private partnership is conducted using both the method of expert evaluation and the formal method of determining weighting coefficients. The most efficient method in the theory of expert evaluation has proved to be the ranking and scoring method. Applying the scoring methods, experts evaluate the importance of a separate criterion on the scale from 0 to 10. Formal methods of determining weighting coefficients assess the importance of separate criterion with the help of coefficients. We have managed to work out the support measures for each life cycle of the development of cultural and creative industry, and namely: financial measures - guarantee schemes and other financial and credit mechanisms, accessibility of seed and venture capital etc.; productional measures; market measures; administrative and political measures; supporting measures. The state as a part to the partnership agreement of public-private partnership can assume the functions of risk insurance by means of providing guarantees on state credits or subventions at different levels, export credit insurance and counter-guarantees. This mechanism will allow to reduce the costs, ensure investment and lower the risk level of cultural industries, thus determining attractiveness and competitivity of the cultural sphere. We state the fact that the use of the technologies of financing the cultural and creative industry approved by the EU will allow to create the mechanism of support based on the organizational, behavioral and technical interconnections in Russia as well. Apart from direct effectiveness, the influence of culture on economic efficiency also has an indirect impact revealed in supporting the values common for customer groups which define the ways of involvement of the members of a group into the economic production processes. The results of the research may prove useful for the elaboration of government policy measures for the implementation of the forms of financing cultural and creative sphere in today's economy.

AB The study of religious and political attitudes of young people at the all-Russian and regional levels is always of great interest for the research community. The paper is based on the results of a mass political and sociological survey of 1 220 young people (aged from 18 to 25 years old) of the Republic of Dagestan in 2017. The sociological survey was conducted throughout Dagestan, among young men and women living in cities and rural areas. The study touches upon the assessment of religious revival, the characteristics of the religious situation in Dagestan, the aggravation of the religious situation in the republic, the youth's preferences for social and State organization, the orientation of contacts with Islamic states, the attitudes of youth to ISIS and the likelihood of their participation in the ranks of ISIS and other religion-based terrorist organizations, the attitude of youth towards the military actions of Russia against ISIS in Syria, the sources of religious information, reflecting the religious component on interethnic relations.
   The study shows that the level of religiosity among Dagestan youth is at a high level, which is especially evident in some issues, and this causes some concern. However, this phenomenon is not critical. Young people remain oriented towards secularism in the State system. For young people, the economic and political factor is more important than the religious one, which has more spiritual and moral significance. The youth is aware of and supports the foreign policy course of the country's leadership and approves the military-political policy in Syria.

AB The article is focused on the theological debates on the issues of 'aqidah between Shihabetdin Marjani and his opponents. The debate is viewed as a mechanism for the search and approval of truth. Being one of the possible answers of the Tatar Muslims to the imperial challenge, the religious debate is analyzed in the light of the changed political, economic and social conditions of the new era, when through theological discussions about the kalam and divine attributes, there were outlined new boundaries of the religious tradition. Within the framework of this problem the following issues are discussed: 1) the polemical genre in the Islamic world; Majlis as a forum for discussions and debates of Muslims in solving topical issues of the intellectual, religious and social character; the types of disputes are jadal and munazara; 2) the reformation of Islam in the late 19th century among Muslims of the Russian Empire; 3) the discussion of the image of the "true" creed ('aqidah) through dogmatic discussions about the kalam, mutakallims, the doctrine of the divine attributes and the connection of the attributes with Allah; 4) the sources of the creed ('aqidah), the bound- aries of the sources authority; forbidden innovations (bidaat); 5) the accusation of unbelief (takfir) and the boundaries of unbelief (kufr); 6) the return to the "uprightness" through a renewal (tajdid), which supposed, on the one hand, the introduction into the tradition of "necessary" and "true" conceptions, and on the other hand, the rejection of "irrelevant", that is, allegedly, "untrue" views; 7) the criticism of Marjani as a legitimate participant in the dispute, the innovator of Islam (mujaddid) and a theologian and jurist capable of ijtihad (mujtahid). The study of the polemic as a reaction of Muslims to the imperial challenge in the new era conditions made it possible to trace the way Muslim scholars outlined the new boundaries of the religious doctrine and thanks to this adapted the religious tradition to the social realities of the Russian Empire in the last third of the 19th century, and simultaneously they reviewed the environment in the light of the sources.

DE revolution; violence; political order; legitimacy; modernity; late

   consensus; rental society; precariat
AB Revolution simultaneously legitimises and denies the coordinate centre of the political order of Modernity. It is difficult to describe the historical evolution from the early industrial, class-national forms of political organisation to late or global Modernity other than in terms of a low-intensity revolution in the rate of social change. On the other hand, this permanent modernisation is not revolutionary in the sense that the periodic splits of elites, colour revolutions, coups and national liberation movements do not in and of themselves make demands for fundamental change in the value-institutional core of the political order of Modernity. The potential for a new revolution can be consequent only on a repudiation of Modernity in favour of an alternative political project having a greater capability for universalisation and totalisation. If, in legitimising its liberal consensus and nation-state models as the dominant political format of their synthesis, capitalism is the value-institutional quintessence of the political order of Modernity, it is precisely in challenges to capitalism, the liberal consensus and nationalism that provide the most obvious means for crystallising revolutionary movements. From such a perspective, capitalism increasingly comes up against the global limits of its expansion, with class ideologies degenerating into a fragmented, technologically-intermediated populism, and nation-states experiencing increasing pressure from alternative political formats (city networks, multinational corporations, etc.) as they attempt to preserve the model of the social state. While various discourses and social groups profess to play the role of revolutionary utopias and subjects, in essence, their ability to present a totalising alternative to late Modernity remains an open question. A utopian systemic challenge to Modernity, connected with a morally more justified configuration and associated hierarchy of legitimate violence, is yet to emerge, whether from within Modernity or some source external to it. It is demonstrated that in the long term a serious (and possibly revolutionary) correction of the political order of modern societies will be capable of producing a rental transformation of capitalism and an expansion of the rent-class stratification mechanisms associated with precarisation, along with a reduction of social mobility trajectories and the prospects of active social groups.

TI ON THE "IRRATIONAL" IN POLITICAL SCIENCE AND IN POLITICAL PRACTICES
SO SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS
LA Russian
DT Editorial Material
DE rational and irrational in human conscience and political practices;
   methods of political forecasting; information politics of Russia
AB The author, parting from the premise that the world political analysts failed to foresee some prominent political changes of the recent times, comes to the conclusion about the inadequacy of the existing methods of political analysis and forecasting. Some recent scientific works by Russian and foreign specialists made him think that a purely rationalist approach to the world studies, that has been used since the times of the Renascence, partly exhausted itself. Along with the Russian authors Baranovski and Bogaturov, the Author thinks, that from now on our political analysis should be enriched by the introduction of some elements of a so called "natural - chaotic essence", which influences the world events through the element of "happening". The core of such an approach could include: 1) the recognition of a partial inadequacy of purely rationalist methods in our assessment of human nature and social phenomena; 2) the transference of the center of gravity in our social studies from economic to national-ethnic, culturological and civilizational aspects; 3) a wider use of historic analogies in the studies of all the problems of modern international relations. A linear character of our political forecasting will most evidently suffer because of that. Nevertheless, it would contribute to the elaboration of a more stereoscopic, complex view on the international relations as a whole and, particularly, on such problems as terrorism, illegal migration, separatism, and so on. The Author agrees with the thesis of some Occidental analysts (Bernard Yak, e.g.) that we should learn to "dutifully live" with certain irrational phenomena of political life (e.g. - nationalism), by purposely searching for and the accentuation of their "brighter" sides in the detriment of "dark" ones. The main prerequisite of such an accentuation, according to the Author, should be a wider use of education and culture. Culture, as a "positive" irrational actor (in all its demonstrations, including the political culture) should be seen as a promoter of a more active information strategy of Russia in the world arena. A shift for such a strategy is utterly necessary because a continuation of a "defensive" policy in this sphere can lead to significant losses.

AB The subject of the study were some of the main trends in the innovation policies of China, South Korea and Japan and their impact on the innovative cooperation of these countries with Russia. The aim of the work was to analyze the innovation processes which have been taking place in the three leading East Asian countries, taking into account the strategic interests of the Russian Federation. Methodologically, the systemic, institutional, neoinstitutional and comparative approaches were used. Research methods: comparative analysis, structural and functional analysis, sociological analysis, observation, included observation, extrapolation. Institutional mechanisms of Russia's partnership with three East Asian countries were considered, the main results and the degree of their effectiveness were described. The necessity of shifting the emphasis of cooperation from the industrial sector to the non-material sphere (creation of information, knowledge, services) was justified. The research results are in demand in the situation of making political decisions in the innovation policy segment in the context of ensuring national security, effective international and regional policies. In the process of research, the hypothesis was confirmed that the process of world and regional development of a cooperative type is pushing modern countries to search for options for rapprochement and interaction based on innovation. A prognosis was made for the development of innovative integration between Russia and the countries of East Asia. The main obstacles to its implementation were noted. Russia, having set ambitious goals to achieve a high level of the well-being of the population and to consolidate the geopolitical role of the country as one of the leaders that determine the world political agenda, should be oriented towards the transition to an innovative socially-oriented model of development.

LA Russian
DT Book Review
DE Muscovy; Siberian khanate; Shibanids; Kuchumovichi; post-Horde world
AB This article analyzes the new book by Russian historians V.V. Trepavlov and A.V. Belyakov dedicated to the Siberian princes and their role in national history. The first part of the book is dedicated to the struggle of Kuchum Khan and his descendants for revenge in Siberia and the restoration of the Siberian Khanate, and the second one - to the conditions of the Kuchumovichi's appearances in the Moscow state, their inhabitancy, the role in political processes and the further disappearance of the dynasty. The book is written on the basis of a large number of archival documents, mainly from the Russian State Archives of Ancient Acts (RGADA). It allowed reconstructing the rich tapestry of the Kuchumovichi's life in Siberia and the Moscow state based on the methods and traditions of political history, studies of everyday life, prosopography, microhistory and genealogy. On the one hand, the book will be important for studies of Siberia, because the Siberian kings and princes in the Moscow state tried, if possible, to keep their familiar surroundings for a long time that preserved some distinctive features of their prior life's period, which cannot be directly reconstructed with local materials. On the other hand, many nuances of the everyday life of these dynasts and their entourage can characterize not only the Siberian aristocracy but also the relevant layers of Moscow society as a whole, for which the Eastern traditions were also not immune to. Therein, we get an interesting slice of the Moscow society of the 16th-17th centuries: notably, the gradual forfeiture of the princes directly coincided with the exhaustion of the post-Horde and Eastern traditions in Russia as a whole. Despite some minor shortcomings, the materials of the monograph are so manifold so each reader will find in it some of his or her own interesting aspects, and will get an idea of an interesting slice of the Russian history of the 16th-17th centuries.

TI Vyatka Revolutionaries in the "Government Facility": 1905-1913
SO HERALD OF AN ARCHIVIST
LA Russian
DT Article
DE First Russian revolution; Vyatka; political prisoners; prison;
   Socialists-Revolutionaries
AB The article analyses various aspects of the life in prison of political prisoners of the Vyatka gubernia. Unpublished documents from the archives of Kirov and Moscow, on which this study is based, designate the subject of the study; that is, they allow to establish forms of resistance of political prisoners to prison regime, to identify patterns of their escapes, to trace dynamics in occupancy of political prisons in the Vyatka gubernia, to establish instances of interaction between representatives of different left parties while in penal institutions. The timeframe of the study is the period of the first Russian revolution of 1905-1908, when prisons ceased to be the tenement of few and far between ardent revolutionaries from the privileged strata of society, and swarmed with much less versed ideologically masses of the discontented. Thus, in view of a participant of the revolutionary events of 1905-1908, Socialists-Revolutionary Maximalist G. A. Nestroev, the ideological grounding of the political prisoners deteriorated significantly. The author, however, believes that this 'diversity' of prisoners allows to conduct a more thorough analysis of their public activity in prison and to better link the activities of prisoners with the people on whose behalf the revolutionary forces acted. The author focuses on the Socialists-Revolutionaries, as their percentage among prisoners was much higher than that of the Socialists-Democrats. Known for several high-profile assassinations, the former were considered more dangerous state criminals than the Socialists-Democrat 'propagandists,' and thus were subject to more severe punishments. After the October revolution 1917, the Bolsheviks created an extensive mythologized literature on fellow party members who served time in tsarist prisons but mentioned only several Socialists-Revolutionaries, and these were politically harmless, or deceased (like E. S. Sazonov), or attached to the Bolshevik party (like V. N. Rukhlyadev). Findings and conclusions of the article can be used in research of the later periods in the history of Russia and the Soviet Union, particularly, for comparison of the prisoners' struggle with the prison administration and of the forms of assistance to prisoners from the outside in tzarist Russia and later.

DE Dalmatius the Junior; Constantine I; Thracia; Dalmatian cavalry;
   inscriptions; Illyricum; master of soldiers; expeditionary army
AB The paper deals with a military career of Dalmatius the Junior, a nephew of Emperor Constantine I the Great. In 335, Constantine confered a title of Caesar on Dalmatius and gave him the Lower Danube regions - Thracia, Minor Scythia, Lower Moesia, Macedonia, Dacia and Greece - for supervision. But two years later, in 337, Dalmatius the Junior was murdered as a result of a state plot held in Constantinople. Having based on narrative sources (an anonymous Epitoma de Caesaribus, the so-called Anonymus Valesianus, part I, and the works of Zosimus and Johannes Lydus), which contain very scarce evidence about Dalmatius the Junior's military and political achievements, the author proposes an idea that the nephew of Constantine I held an office of master of soldiers (magister militum), a supreme commander of expeditionary (field) army comitatenses, which stood in Thracia. Therefore, the author suggests that Dalmatius the Junior was one of the two first masters of soldiers appointed by Constantine I. Presumably, Dalmatius the Junior received the office in 335 simultaneously with a title of Caesar. Having based on the newest epigraphical document, that is an inscription from Lower Moesia published just recently, in 2016, the author concludes that the basis of Dalmatius the Junior's troops were detachments of the mobile Dalmatian cavalry.

DT Article
DE world economy; outlook; China; United States; 19th CPC Congress
AB After the XIX National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Xi Jinping managed to consolidate political power at the highest level since Mao Zedong's time. Xi achieved his personal goal of becoming the "No. 3 leader" in modern Chinese history, having managed without an open opposition in the CPC to make changes to the CPC Constitution and put his ideas on "socialism with Chinese characteristics in a new era" on the same level as the ideas of Mao and Deng Xiaoping and above the ideological contribution of his predecessors Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao. In addition, Xi was able almost entirely with the exception of Premier Li Keqiang to replace the PC members of the PCB of the Central Committee of the CPC without designating, in spite of the tradition established during the reforms, his successor. All members of the PC are at such an age that in five years they will overcome the age limit and will not be able to qualify for the post of General Secretary. At the same time, Xi introduced a number of new personnel to the BOP and the CC, including the "young" ones, born in the 1960s, who worked together with Xi at the provincial level. And also - almost completely got rid of the cadre heritage of Jiang and Hu. It seems that Xi has decided to "grow" a successor of the current 50-year-olds by organizing among them a kind of competition for the place, the arbiter of which will be Xi, for whom a new post is likely to be created after 2022. In the economy immediately after the congress and visit to China, D. Trump, it seems that work begins on the implementation of pre-Congress and congressional promises of Xi on financial liberalization. In mid-November 2017, the Chinese government announces plans to open the financial services market (insurance, investment activities, securities) for 3 to 5 years for foreign capital, giving it, ultimately, the right to own up to 100% of the property (instead of less 50% today) of joint and foreign corporations working in these sectors. The visit of D. Trump to China immediately after the end of the XIX Congress of the CPC was of a special nature for Peking. It was important to show that, as a strong leader, he is able to build new relations in the "new era" with the main, in the Chinese sense, world development actor - the US, and move from the previous phase of the deterioration of bilateral relations to a new one - their improvement. In China, the Summit was given a special character, underlining its "State visit plus ... ". Against the backdrop of the Summit, Chinese analysts say privately that relations with the United States today are more important for China than for Russia.

AB This article is devoted to Barry Buzan and his role in the modern development of English school of International relations. The aim of the article is to demonstrate the main aspects and the problems of English school theory on the boundary of XX-XXI centuries. The sources for the study were the texts of published works by leading members of the English school and B. Buzan.
   English school of International relations formed in the end 1950-1960. Historians H. Butterfield, M. Wight, A. Watson, M. Howard, philosophers D. McKinnon and H. Bull took an active part in the creation of this school. Concept "International Society" became symbol and special mark of this scientific community thanks to the books by H. Bull in 1970-1980. But to the end of XX century the development of the English school clashed with many objective and subjective difficulties.
   B. Buzan is a famous and authoritative specialists on International relations in the world science. His scientific work obtains general recognition in United States, China, many European countries. His books demonstrate his abilities to work in the different theoretical directions. At the same time, he is an important figure for understanding the main change in English school of International Relations during last 20 years. The results of his involvement into English school theory are the following:
   1. He supposes that the concept "World Society" is an important part of the English school theory. Like two other principal elements of general conception - "International Society" and "System states" - "World Society" had principal position for the M. Wight, H. Bull and other first members of the community. But the content of the concept was uncertain. B. Buzan arose the complex of the specific questions, which can define the content of the concept in the research program of English school.
   2. He continues to study the history of international relations as autonomous part of the agenda of English school. He adopted the international system idea to the epoch before Westphalia Peace of 1648. B. Buzan continues tradition.f the school's writers (M. Wight, A. Watson), who thought that history is an important part of the study of International relations. Such position of the English school differs from American discipline, where International relations traditionally are considered as a branch of Political Science.
   3. He tries to include economic questions into agenda of the English school theory. The ignorance of the economic problems in International relations is a traditional shortage of conception of International Society. This part of B. Buzan's work is not finished, but he made the first important steps.
   4. He made a new organizational format for the School after British Committee for the Theory of International Politics finished its work. Committee had worked during 25 years (1959-1985) and became the base for the development of two first generations of English school of International relations. B. Buzan made the conception of International Society more open to discussions of modern science, more popular among specialists on International relations abroad. At the same time, he keeps the basis of the English school theory. Thanks to his activity during last 20 years English school of International Relations is considered nowadays as an autonomous part of world theory in International relation.

TI THE PHENOMENON OF TRAMP AND THE AMERICAN SYSTEM OF SEPARATION OF POWERS
SO MGIMO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE separation of powers; constitutional system; political elite; elite
   conflict; political stability; D.Trump; USA
AB The US political system is repeatedly subjected to significant deviations from those constitutional provisions that determine the relationship between the three branches of power. The scientists use such phrases as "Jacksonian democracy" or "Imperial presidency" to illustrate the attempts of American presidents to intervene those issues which constitutionally assigned to the other branches of power.
   In general, despite these deviations from legally established rules, the elites retained a general consensus on the notion of stable domestic and foreign policies. As the main threat to this stability, the possibility of organizing a revolution from above was considered. However, in November 2016 D. Trump managed to be elected under the slogan of such a revolution, becoming the first the president in the political history of the United States, which has no firm support among the elites.
   Undoubtedly, such a success illustrated serious problems within American society, that's why the reasons of the conflict between D. Trump and his opponents could be found first of all in the ideological sphere. The newly elected president proposes a transformation of the fundamental basics that determined the vectors of US foreign and domestic policy in recent decades.
   In this case, unlike the historical precedents considered in this paper, D. Trump's criticism goes beyond simple accusations on the pages of the mass media or in statements of the leading representatives of the American political establishment. It takes a form of an acute confrontation between the branches of power and within them. The analysis of this situation is proposed in the article, both from the point of view of political and legal sciences, which could help to make a forecast on the chances of D. Trump to become a winner in this conflict within the American political elite.

AB The paper represents a review on a selection of scientific articles published in the journal "Vestnik Kostromskogo gosudarstvennogo universiteta", dedicated to the celebration of the 150th anniversary of the great Russian writer Maxim Gorky. Upon the decision by UNESCO to include the name of Gorky in the calendar of memorable dates, his celebration acquired world status: this year Gorky's festivals will be held at the cultural and scientific sites of Belarus, Italy, France and South Korea. The paper raises the issue of Gorky's heritage coverage in modern studies and the existence of untouched scientific topics. The articles written by the staff of the world leading scientific Gorky center in IWL RAS, where on the basis of archival materials since 1937 they carried out preparation and publication of his heritage, allow for raising the question on the level of knowledge in modern Gorky studies and setting new tasks. According to the author's conclusions the most acute topic now is the Gorky's attitude to "disenfranchised", "mechanical people", to the prison system, to intelligentsia and new hero, new style of literature, which became major themes in writer's journalism and his letters in the 1930s. The reviewed articles revealed the archival and documentary potential of the Gorky theme, and also indicated to the need of abandoning the ready-made conceptual schemes and approaches to the heritage of the "proletarian writer".

DT Book Review
DE Kurds; Adygean Kurds; migrants; adaptation; integration; interethnic
   conflict; incorrect borrowings
AB Kurds came to inhabit the territories of the Russian Federation (Former RSFSR) only in the last two or three decades and in this regard any study pertaining to the subject is welcome. This review discusses the latest monograph entitled "Kurds of Adygea" produced by a number of prominent scholars of Adygean State University. In particular, the review contests the monograph's main and highly consequential conclusion, according to which Kurds, given their large and growing numbers, present a potential threat to the ethno-demographic and socio-political situation in the Republic of Adygea. However, while no academic work can be entirely criticism-proof, the monograph in question can hardly be praised for its academic rigor. The reviewer argues that the central research question is in fact devoid of a scholarly approach and the monograph's arguments are based upon highly questionable and speculative assertions.

AB The article focuses on the first general of Kurdish origin in the Russian Imperial army-Jafar Agha. Having begun his service in 1853, he was promoted to the rank of major-general in 1871. His military career is not a typical one for Russian officer, as the latter were often motivated by political aspirations. Jafar Agha was enlisted into the imperial military in order to command and establish Kurdish divisions within the army. During the Crimean War (1853-56), he was tasked with recruiting Kurdish subjects of the Ottoman Empire into the Russian forces; through his direct involvement two regiments were established - one within the Yerevan division, made up primarily of Kurds of the eponymous province, and another one within the Alexandropol division. Following the war, and up until his death, Jafar Agha continued his military service commanding Kurdish regiments. Although the majority of those under his command were subjects of the Russian state, his fame and influence spread into the Ottoman territory thus providing further security for the Russian frontier regions. This articles aims to discuss and assess the importance of his role in the evolution of the Russian Empire's relations with the Kurds.

AB The article studies mass political repression in the USSR in 1937-1940s to offer an unbiased reconstruction of the process and to retrieve the historical experience at current stage of democratic transformations in the country. The article is devoted to one of the repressed Red Army command officers, head of the Political Directorate for the Central Asian Military District, Brigadier N. P. Katerukhin, participant in the First World and Civil Wars. It follows the fate of Katerukhin, who was awarded a rank of 'Brigade Commissar' in April 1938. The article focuses on the events of the second half of 1930s in the Central Asian Military District: mechanics of the NKVD investigation, operations and activities of commanders, political agencies, and military justice. Despite his honorable service, energy, initiative, and diligence at a difficult time of political strife, Katerukhin was under suspicion of the relevant authorities. Information on 'sabotage activities' of the secretary of the district party commission N. P. Katerukhin kept coming from ex-director of the military pedagogical faculty of the N. G. Tolmachev Military Political Academy M. G. Fradlin to the supreme bodies of the party since January 1937. The authors have studied N. P. Katerukhin's archival investigatory record to show the nature of the NKVD activities at the time of contraction of mass political repression. The most important evidence against N. P. Katerukhin was 'confessions' of Division Commissar V. K. Kontstantinov, who in 1936 promoted Katerukhin's assignment to the post of director of the district party commission. Kontstantinov admitted under questioning to participation in a counter-revolutionary organization and revealed that he enlisted Katerukhin to the said anti-Soviet organization. By then the investigators had testimonies that at the time of political purges N. P. Katerukhin had expelled blameless members and reinstated enemy elements. The materials of the archival investigatory record are being introduced into scientific use for the first time. Of particular value are the interrogation reports, which contain valuable materials on the military and political history of our country. All this bespeaks the importance of studying archival investigatory files as a source on history of mass political repression in the Red Army.

AB The article considers minority education issues in New Zealand. The author takes into consideration the social status of Maori, draws reader's attention to the state policy of the Ministry of Education of New Zealand and the activities of governmental and non-governmental organizations concerning the English language and Maori. The Maori language had a low level of linguistic proficiency: it had no writing system, literary tradition, and technical terminology. The language policy in this aspect enforces tolerance in New Zealand society. It should be noted that there was significant social and ethnic diversity in New Zealand because the vast majority of the immigrants were traders, sailors and whalers from Scotland, England, Australia and Ireland.
   Maori underachievement has been highlighted in the education system since the early 1900s. In schools and workplaces Maori were discouraged from speaking their own language and housing policy encouraged dispersing the Maori population to prevent residential concentrations. Maori children were not being adequately educated owing to prolonged systemic failure. In 2009 only 22.6% of Maori school leavers were eligible to enter university, compared with 51.7% of European New Zealanders. The author analyses New Zealand state reforms, aimed at cultivation of the cultural, educational and communicative value of the Maori language and culture. The most common language in New Zealand is English, and it continues to occupy a prestigious position in all spheres of communication: in politics, economy, education, science, art and culture.
   The Maori language in New Zealand has existed for eight centuries and it has been experiencing a strong influence of the English language. Until the mid XX century Maori spoke only in their native language. New Zealand Council for linguistic studies, Department of the study of the Maori language at the University of Massey, Auckland express great public and scientific interest in the development and strengthening of the Maori language. Data research centers with the cooperation of the government organizations conduct effective work on the revival of the cultural Maori heritage, carry out major socio-cultural events among the wider population of New Zealand.
   The paper draws attention to the growth of ethnic consciousness of the Maori people, communicative expansion of the Maori language usage in public, political, educational, scientific and cultural spheres of New Zealand. New Zealand colleges, universities, and research centers with the cooperation of state organizations, conduct effective work on the revival of the cultural Maori heritage, carry out major socio-cultural activities among New Zealand population, and develop a special method of teaching the Maori language.
   The author comes to the conclusion that there is an increase of ethnic identity, expansion of the communicative use of the Maori language in public and political life, education, and mass communications in New Zealand. The prevalence of the Maori language is also seen in educational institutions as a teaching subject. Knowledge of the English language gives Maori an access to successful learning, education pathways, higher education, wealth and economic advantage.

Close economic interconnection between China and the regional countries, which Beijing tries to use as a political instrument, makes the situation even more complicated.

ID CONTEXTUAL APPROACH; RUSSIAN SOCIUM
AB The article is devoted to the social well-being of the Ural Federal District population during the socio-economic crisis of 2014-2016. This crisis has a deep, systemic nature, and therefore it has a direct impact on the everyday life of Russians. We assume that basic factors, which affect the social well-being of the population, depend on the socio-economic and political environment of the region. Among these factors it is necessary to single out the following ones: the financial position, the nature and degree of the main problems in life; strategies for social action in the context of unresolved issues in the district, assessment of the economic situation. If there is a constructive dialogue between the authorities and the society in the region, then the responsibility of top managers and officials of all ranks for implementing the adopted laws, programs and commitments leads to greater governance and satisfaction with the life of the population in the district. Despite the decrease in real disposable incomes of the population and other social problems, the study found a significant decrease in the potential protest activity. Factors that reduce this indicator at the all Russian level are a high level of popular support for the current authorities in Russia along with the rise of patriotic sentiments due to the accession of Crimea to the Russian Federation in March 2014. At the regional level the phenomenon of the decreasing level of potential protest activity is explained by the transformation of the management system of the federal district. In this context the authors attribute an important role to the main social institutions, primarily political ones, and reveal the relationship between satisfaction with the economic situation and the effectiveness of regional management practices. Significant changes in the social moods often occur as a result of the resignation of inefficient governors and the implementation of a new economic policy.

AB The monograph "Chechnya during the Caucasian War (1818 - 1859)" by the well-known Chechen historian S.A. Gapurov which was published in 2016 is viewed in the context of contemporary historiography. Firstly, the wide documentary material and range of research it is based on are seen as a big advantage. The authors of the article argue that its source database is massive and reliable enough to facilitate a complex analysis of economic, social, political and other factors of the outbreak of the Caucasian War, to describe its stages and define the role of Chechnya and the Chechens in the Caucasian War. S.A. Gapurov's conclusion that the military victory of the Russian Imperial Army was preconditioned by a number of objective and subjective factors, argue the authors. One of such factors was the ability of the Russian commandment to adjust their tactics and army equipment to the natural conditions of North Caucasus. Another important factor was the Russian army's acquisition of the methods of waging the war which the inhabitants of the mountainous regions of North Caucasus resorted to as well as the elements of their military culture. On the other hand, S. A. Gapurov provided a complex and profound analysis of the factors which weakened the Chechens' military resistance and made part of the Chechen leaders side with the Russian authorities. The most significant ones were the threat of total extermination of the Chechen people, the Chechens' utter fatigue from the war and the inner corruption of the North Caucasus Imamat. Commending S. A. Gapurov's objective and reasonable approach the authors of the article conclude that this is the right way to study the history of the Caucasian War.

AB The author analyzes sociological journalism and political predictions of Russian-American sociologist P.A. Sorokin during the period of the Russian political collapse of 1917-18, as well as the possibility of adapting his "sociology of the revolution" to studies of the transformation of the contemporary socio-political system of the Russian Federation. The author reveals the dependence of P. Sorokin's "stronger scientific approach" to studying the course of the February and October coups of 1917 and predicting their consequences on his ideological beliefs and party positions. In this context, the example of P. Sorokin is seen as a reason for understanding the causes of the distemper in Russia and the responsibility of sociological science for the reliability of political forecasts. The article highlights the connection between political positivism and operative masonry of P.A. Sorokin. His case shows that political foresight can be fundamentally untenable, but, nevertheless, instrumental from the point of view of achieving parties or groups goals.

ID POLICY
AB Understanding discourse as the special semiotic dimension of political reality, we consider the evolution of the practices of criticizing it. In other world struggle for language is regarded as entirely political. Initially, this approach was associated with revolutionary transformations (attempts to overturn the old symbolic order and create a new language of revolution). Then, under the influence of the avant-garde, there were established special forms of political practices that were aimed at discourse structures: anarchists tried to create an anti-hierarchical language; American Yippies seek to form outsidedness own space; in France leaders of Situationist International developed the practice of detournement (flipping). Only the latter turned to be politically successful until the present day. Under the influence of leftist political thought and the Avant-guard critical discourse studies became an academic (research) project. There are two stages of its development. The first is connected to criticizing discourse as a repressive totality (G. Marcuse, R. Bart and J. Baudrillard). Since the 1970s. under the influence of the genealogical project of M. Foucault and development of interpretative and constructivist paradigms in the social sciences, a critical analysis of discourse increasingly focuses on destroying specific symbolic orders, essayist concepts, as well as everyday language, which, in fact, according to critical linguists, imbued with ideologies. Marxist ideal of "universal liberation" was replaced by neoliberal ideal of equality, with an emphasis on the effectiveness of communication and human rights. Critical discourse studies became less "philosophical" and more analytical; forms of critique also have changed - from external to internal and immanent.

DT Article
DE Great Britain; perception; image of the country; research; content

AB Political images formed in the mass consciousness largely determine not only the attitude of citizens to various political events and objects, but influence their political behavior as well. By the fact that new-day (modern) politics is becoming more and more virtual, we cannot underestimate the influence of mass media communication on the formation of these images. To be sure, the contextual factor, which includes situational changes taking place in the political arena both in and outside the country, is the determining factor for the content of the information that comes from the mass media, and political images are formed in the mass consciousness on the basis of it respectively. The author had an endeavor to analyze the transformation of communicative images of power and political leaders in the Great Britain under the influence of Brexit, i.e. during the period from 2014 to 2017. Since the main economic partners of the country are the U.S. and the EU, the material for content analysis came from the main news channels in these countries: American CNN and Fox News, as well as the European Euronews and France 24. The study was conducted and developed by the Department of Sociology and Psychology of Politics, Faculty of Political Science at the Lomonosov Moscow State University after methodology, according to which the image of the country structurally contains images of the territory, people, government, political leaders, "friends" and "enemies". Each of these images was evaluated on the scale of strength and weakness, attractiveness and unattractiveness, activity and passivity, before and after the Brexit. The study showed that the image of power, regardless of the country of media residence, is undergoing minor changes. The geographical parameter as well as the political leader and the people political images have experienced the greatest transformation in the US and EU media reports of 2014-2017. Thus, if the image of a political leader changes in association with a changing composition of the UK Government, the transformation of the UK's spatial-geographical image and that of the British people carries a fundamental character and is accompanied by a change of perception attitudes, political mythology, the accentuation of different stereotypes within the mass consciousness, the formation of images of "alien" and "enemy," the conflict of attitudes in political behavior. The materials of the European media demonstrate that territorial and ethnic components determine the current image of the UK and, consequently, the relationship between Britain and the EU amid new forms of the European space organization and European policy. The data obtained during the research not only give us the idea about the current image broadcasted by mass media but also let us reveal both psychological mechanisms of the image formation and the limits of mass media influence on the citizens. In practice, such data can determine the validity of the changes that a country needs to take to create its branding and communication strategy.

   pan-Germanism; Central European identity; Cold War; ideological
   struggle; Prague spring; historiography; Slavic studies; historical myth
AB The article analyzes one of the most significant directions in the development of Czech and Slovak historiography during the Cold War period, i.e. the treatment by Czech and Slovak historians of the concept of Pan-Slavism and the role this ideological and political trend has played in the development of Czech and Slovak national statehood in the course of the Middle Ages, Early-Modern, Modern, and Contemporary periods. In addition to that, political, ideological, spiritual and historiographical factors are discussed which affected the way Pan-Slavism and the Slav agenda in general were understood by Czech and Slovak historians. On the basis of the historiographical analysis of a large amount of articles and monographs by Czech and Slovak historians published from mid 1940s to late 1980s, the author arrives at important conclusions. One of them states that in Marxist historiography the history of relationships between the Slav nations and Russia have turned into an ideological battle-field. Academic debate tended to be fierce political polemics. In socialist Czechoslovakia the Slavic research of the new and latest periods witnessed the emergence of politics into science and science into politics. At the same time historical research in Czechoslovakia would have the plurality of opinions and conceptions until the suppression of the Prague spring in 1968. The 1960s saw the culmination of interest among Czech and Slovak historians in the Slav topics. Their research works contained direct analogies between national movements of the Czechs and Slovaks under the Habsburg monarchy and their intention to safeguard their model of socialism from the Kremlin in the late 1960s. This could not but lead to poorer quality and efficiency of scientific debate and to increased ideological tension. The historical polemics about Slavism and Pan-Slavism aroused public interest. In 1968 a lot of Czech and Slovak historians took the side of the reformers struggling for "socialism with a human face".

   Identifying Main Trends in Social Entrepreneurship Development
SO ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CHANGES-FACTS TRENDS FORECAST
LA English
DT Article
DE social entrepreneurship; political economy; mainstream; industrial
   relations
AB The paper discusses some features of the source of social entrepreneurship as a new form of business organization, aimed at implementing social objectives in the context of strengthening neoliberal trends in economic policy and economic theory, rather than at maximizing the owners' profit. It is demonstrated that, remaining within the framework of the neoliberal ideology which retains its influence in the economic science, it is impossible to create an adequate theory explaining the importance of social entrepreneurship in the context of the process of changing paradigms of economic relations, since under the influence of this ideology false stereotypes are established, which is accompanied by falsification of historical facts. In this context it seems that the methodology of political economy, taking into account the current trends in the transformation of socio-economic relations and the deviation of the trend of social development from the framework of the formally preserved, but declining neoliberal paradigm, is very popular, especially since its problem areas include issues such as the distinction between individual and social forms of production, the relations between the necessary and surplus product, the distribution of surplus value (in case of its occurrence), the issues of individualization and socialization of economic phenomena, the correlation between market and non-market production areas and distribution of the final product, the issue of recognizing the social significance of the result of individual labor. In the present paper these methodological principles are applied for analyzing a complex, contradictory phenomenon of social entrepreneurship. The purpose of the research is to justify the need for a political economic approach to studying the main trends in social entrepreneurship development amid limited theoretical and methodological tools available within the neo-liberal economic theory. This will solve the following problems: form a completely objective image of its development, determine the true nature of this phenomenon and identify certain features of production method underlying social entrepreneurship. Since social entrepreneurship is one of the forms of alienation removal, in the context of political economy, assuming the desire for associated social creativity, it can be perceived as one of the tools for transition from the "kingdom of necessity" to the "kingdom of freedom", according to K. Marx.

AB Based on newly available archival documents and recent literature the article presents an analysis of the origins and development of the Bilderberg meetings of transatlantic elite in 1950s-1980s. Conspiracy theories notwithstanding it is demonstrated that the organization of these meetings was a joint transnational project of European and American elites in which private and government structures merged and private initiative was interwoven with group and bureaucratic interests. The promotion of this project became an important part of the formation of the Cold War Atlantic community. Also examined on case studies basis are specific functions performed by the Bilderberg meetings: elite fraternization and networking, consensus maintenance and reinforcement, elite recruitment and rejuvenation. The final conclusion is that despite many deep changes in international and transatlantic relations since its establishment Bilderberg retains its importance compared to other more specialized and homogeneous transatlantic networks because it serves as a hub network of confidential contacts between all key sectors and national segments of transatlantic elites. Activities of Bilderberg as well as of other informal transnational networks present a fertile field for interdisciplinary studies combining methods of history, political science and sociology.

DT Article
DE Pskov; military novel; Dovmont; Prince; image; cycle
AB The present article is to study the "Narrative about Dovmont", the Old Russian literary work of the older period. The information about Dovmont, prince of Pskov, is contained in Lithuanian, Pskov and other common Russian sources. However, the "Narrative about Dovmont", originated in Pskov, is considered to be the main source. The "Narrative about Dovmont" is a collection of the Old Russian literary works telling us about the 13th century events on the north-west border of Russia and depicting their main protagonist Dovmont-Timothy, prince of Pskov. Yet it is not a cycle of works in the true (literary) sense of the word, nor is it a series of tales about a concrete character related to some similar repeated events. It should rather be called the historiographic cycle. The "Narrative about Dovmont", passing form one chronicle into another, underwent certain changes ranging from political views expressed in the text treatment to increasing or decreasing text volume. Furthermore, under the influence of stylistic simplification of the text, the information on Dovmont could acquire a more businesslike style, or, on the contrary, more literary one of a particular genre, which didn't often correspond to the general character of the text revision. The paper has addressed following text versions: Prolozhnaya which is known only in two handwritten variants (both dated back to the end of the 14th - beginning of the 15th century); the version in the 1st Chronicle of Pskov. Among the lives of the Russian saints, prince Dovmont, perhaps, is the only saint notable for having various literary images in different text versions of the "Narrative".

AB Psychosemantic approach is mostly in demand when it comes to collective research representations, allowing to identify the underlying attitudes and stereotypes that are poorly reflected upon, or hidden because of social undesirability, and therefore difficult to diagnose. Country's image perception is just such an example. The article deals with a number of images of countries which are well known among student audience in South Korea. Author's psychosemantic technique "The image of a country" was used to obtain empirical data. 107 subjects (females and males) took part in the survey. The study included analysis and interpretation of primary answers on items of the questionnaire, confirmation of universal categories of countries images perception, determination of average scores for all countries from the questionnaire for all categories, reconstruction of integral rating of the positive attitudes toward the countries. For data analysis methods of multivariate statistics were used (principal component analysis and discriminant analysis).

In this article, attention is drawn to the verbalization of the concept "power" in two institutional discourses: political and Christian. We assume that in these discourses the concept is modelled on the basis of diametrically opposite axiological values. The problem of research is interdisciplinary: politics, theology and language, but it is the aspect that is considered to be particularly in demand and relevant today.

TI HISTORY OF INTELLECTUALS IN FRENCH HISTORIOGRAPHY: A CONFLICT OF

DE French history of intellectuals; historiography; new political history;
   social history; interdisciplinarity; comparative studies; history of
   ideas
AB History of intellectuals has acquired the status of an independent sub-discipline in the field of history in the middle of the 1980s and became a florescent field of research in France. Arising in opposition to the traditional approaches of history of ideas and history of philosophy, history of intellectuals has adopted the theories and methods of political history and sociology. In the early 1990s, two competitive approaches emerged within the field. The political approach mainly proposed by J.-F. Sirinelli and M. Winock was aimed at studying the phenomenon of the French intellectuals through the analysis of their political engagement. C. Charle and G. Sapiro developed the social approach to the intellectuals, considering their interactions in the intellectual field using the terms of Pierre Bourdieu. The sociological approach proposes to examine the phenomenon of the intellectual through the analysis of his position in the intellectual field of cultural production and through the consideration of his actions in terms of the struggle for the "symbolic capital". The choice between the broad sociological definition of the intellectual and the narrower political one highlights and continues a long-term rivalry between sociology and history in the field of social sciences. The article analyzes methodological differences of the two approaches and points out the research perspectives of the above-mentioned sub-discipline. Attention is paid to the problem of the definition of the "intellectual" and its resolution in the framework of both approaches.

AB The paper is devoted to the perestroika labour self-management. The author studied the sources of the party organization of the Vyborg Pulp and Paper Plant (the VPPP) to test the skeptical historiographical position on the Soviet industrial democracy in 1987-1989. Using Harry Braverman approach, the author considers production as a space of permanent micro-political clashes between workers, managers and owners (or the state). This approach leads to the study of industrial democracy not only at the factory and factory elections, but in the entire system of institutions and social mobilizations of the Soviet plants during perestroika. The author analyzes the elections at the VPPP, confrontation between the old and new leaders in its party organization and the environmental protest of the workers in 1989. The perestroika politics softened previous authoritarian regime of the party management. New complicated and pluralistic forms appeared instead of the authoritarian old ones. Although new elected positions within the plant staff were still controlled by the party committee, in the case of the conflict between the collective and the managers, this industrial democracy could express independent workers' activity. But this phenomenon was contrary to self-financing and further market tendencies in the Soviet economy. More market relationships meant more senior management and more director's power. By 1990, weak forms of the Soviet industrial democracy became inadequate to market conditions.

DE Archives; information and communication technologies; historical and
   archival heritage; Rosarchiv; Uzarchiv; Uzbekistan
AB The article studies the main ways of using archives as an instrument of popularization of historical and cultural heritage in modern Uzbekistan and assesses the prospects of the Russo-Uzbek archival communications. The history of archives formation and development in Uzbekistan counts many centuries, traditions of archival science in this country are among most ancient in Central Asia. Today the leading archives of Uzbekistan are working on introduction of latest information and communication technologies, sometimes in collaboration with foreign partners. Thus, the archival institutions of Uzbekistan are transforming from places of storages of documents into full-fledged scientific and educational centers that actively participate in promoting national historical and cultural heritage. The most important task that is currently being solved at the highest state level is to increase the level of coordination and systematization of archival materials usage in order to promote national historical and cultural heritage and to shape a modern concept of the genesis and development of the Uzbek state. Uzbekistan archival institutions and fonds are more and more used by its leaders to deal with important social and political challenges facing Uzbekistan (primarily related to achievement of social consensus, development of Uzbek statehood, cultural, and religious spheres). Naturally, the work in this direction is largely aimed at imbuing the population with stable ideas on features of historical development of Uzbekistan and views on international relations, intercultural dialogue, and interreligious interaction. An important task of Russia in this context is to widen cooperation with Uzbekistan in the archival sphere. Publications on the current state of Uzbek archives ignore the use of archival heritage for educational purposes and for solving most urgent social and political task of national development. Moreover, Russian historians and archivists do not receive the necessary information on significant trends in the archival development of Uzbekistan in 2010s; and yet it was a time when informatization proceeded and state interest in popularization of archival heritage grew. Similar methods of training archivists in the two countries should play an important role in the development of Russo-Uzbek cooperation in archiving.

TI THE MEDICALIZATION OF CRIMINALITY IN SOVIET FORENSIC PSYCHIATRY,
   1918-1936
SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL POLICY STUDIES
LA Russian
DT Article
DE medicalization; forensic psychiatry; psychopathy; criminality
AB This paper considers the emergence of early Soviet forensic psychiatry, which was established as an academic discipline and clinical practice in the 1920s and 1930s. The research is based on the materials of professional congresses, scientific works, legal and official records, and examines how psychiatrists tried to define their tasks and professional jurisdiction. Bolsheviks gave professionals an opportunity to reform forensic psychiatric expertise and their status in criminal procedure. More importantly, the relative intellectual freedom and ambiguity of early Soviet criminal codes allowed them to embody a scientific understanding of criminal and criminality in psychiatric practice and theory. A group of Soviet psychiatrists shared a view, which linked antisocial behavior of criminals with their pathological predisposition. The broad category of 'borderline' illnesses was medicalized and placed under the jurisdiction of forensic psychiatry. Thus, practitioners of the discipline tried to establish psychiatric control in prisons. The situation changed, however, in the 1930s when, in response to political challenges of Stalinization, discipline started to rearrange itself. First of all, the category of psychopaths was redefined and narrowed. From that time on only prisoners with organic diseases could be declared insane and subjected to coercive treatment, while all 'borderline' cases of the 'socially dangerous' were transferred from medicine to the penal system. Second, the goals of discipline changed. In the 1920s studies of psychiatrists embraced the wide range of issues, especially, the search for a link between criminality and mental illness. Here the main goal was formulated in a broad sense as building social expertise. In the middle of the 1930s, however, forensic psychiatry restricted this main goal, providing judicial agencies with expert opinions on the mental conditions of the accused. This shift was linked to a reorientation of professional jurisdictions and the institutionalization of forensic psychiatry under conditions of the Stalinization of science and the hardening of criminal justice.

AB This paper is devoted to studying the students' social health. Entering the university, young people find themselves in new conditions of educational activity, new life situations, accompanied by the restructuring of the mental and physiological states. The rapid development of modern society, modern social and political challenges have imposed high requirements for health, aggravating the negative trends of social behaviour of young people. Considering the regional location features of the technical institute, the trends in university admissions of young people, the authors investigated the level of students' social health on the methodology developed by E.V. Tsikalyuk. It has shown that 2/3 of the students have the average level of social health, but 1/3 has a low level. Most students have no difficulty communicating, their relationships are harmonious and bear positive values. But "social adaptation" and "social activity" are at a low level among a large number of students, which indicates the lack of adaptation in the university environment and the reluctance to actively participate in various mass events and public life. As priority directions in social and educational university activities, the paper proposes to implement effective social protection of students and to increase their adaptation to the university environment at different levels: didactic, socio-psychological, professional, ethnic and cultural.

DE Russian-French literary connections; Polish francophonie; Wyzewa;
   Tolstoi; literary translation; imagology; cultural mediation
AB At the turn of the XX century highroad to the worldwide literary fame run through the forging of writer's reputation in cultural capital of the then West, France. Favorable socio-political circumstances for acculturation of the Russian literature emerged there at this time. Francophone Polish immigrants from Russian Empire played vital part in facilitating of the reception of Russian literature in this country. Cultural mediation's model they informed was to a large extent determined by the complex of "concerned alienation" towards imperial metropolitan culture. Acting as cultural mediators they came to be instrumental in penetration into Parisian literary market by Russian writers simultaneously contributing to the adapting of exotic literary "Russianness" towards conventional matrix of the "Latin conscience". The paper looks at the study of a Polish author T. Wyzewski (French pen-name - Teodore de Wyzewa), critic, writer of the treatise "What is Art?" and translator of Tolstoy's novel "Resurrection" as a representative example of cultural sample of this kind. The article explores aesthetic prerequisites of reduction of Tolstoy's text by Wyzewa, bringing to the conclusion, that the Slavic author, with the reputation of respectable Parisian man of letters, seeks to attune Russian material to traditional French aesthetic canon involuntarily contributing to the overcoming of the conservative inertia of the given canon on the part of the French writers that discarded such an experiment. Thus Polish model of the cultural mediation unintentionally reinforces tendencies of the French literary environment towards overcoming of the insularity and adapting authentic images of another nations' culture.

DE state policy protecting the legitimate interests of minors; social

AB the author based the research on the hypothesis: in the Russian Federation there is no legislative regulation of the concepts of juvenile (social technologies) in working with minors while using these technologies by separate subjects of state poli.y concerning minors. Juvenile technologies are considered from the point of view of political practice of the subjects of the Russian Federation.
   The purpose of the scientific article: on the basis of the analysis of legislative changes and the practice of applying social (juvenile, innovative) technologies to minors is to show the necessity of development and consolidation of approaches to the implementation of this technology concerning minors as subjects of state policy.
   The author uses a synergetic approach that allows us to consider the problem of social (juvenile) technologies as a system of relationships between different political actors who interact as a part of the implementation of the state policy concerning minors; take into account the multiplicity of factors affecting the processes occurring in this process. The approach of political modeling is also applied to predict the perspectives of the development of the juvenile practices in the Russian Federation and their legislative control.
   The author studies the juvenile technologies as political technologies as a way of fulfilling goals and objectives in the state policy in the field of the rights' protecting and legitimate interests of children. In the article, based on a review of the experience of successful juvenile practices in the subjects of the Russian Federation, and analysis of legislative and by-laws of the Russian Federation in the sphere of ensuring the rights and legitimate interests of minors, the necessity of synthesis and replicating of these technologies in the territory of the Russian Federation is proved.
   One of the problems the author raises is the lack of mechanisms for interagency interaction and coordination of activities of all subjects of state policy concerning minors. The author suggests appropriate recommendations directed on the optimization of political decisions in this area. The recommendations in particular touch upon the necessity to develop a better evaluation system in the form of indicators for the implementation of the main tasks in the area of state policy on minors through the implementation of juvenile political practices.

AB The research object is the social structure of participants of the Battle of Tewkesberry on May 4, 1471. The purpose is to study the connections between participants and their role models in the times of social political crisis widely referred to as the Wars of the Roses. The research is based on prosopographic method and the sources containing the participants' names. The sources include The Pastons' Letters, official Parliamentary Rolls, narratives of John Bennet, chronicles of Tewkesberry Abbey, History of the Arrival of Edward IV, chronicles of John Warkworth and Polydore Virgil's English History. After a great deal of extensive reading on the subject, 113 people have been listed, including 67 Lancasters and 46 Yorks. 80 of them are noblemen, knights and squires. However, there are some other noblemen (14), clerics, burghers and others. The sources containing personal data on the participants (mostly on the basis of Patent Rolls and Fine Rolls) helped to restore their biographies. A number of family relations and matrimonial ties between the participants have been revealed, liege - vassal relationships. Three models of social behavior have been revealed in the present research. Less than 1/5 of them are the loyal Lancasterians and Yorkists, who supported their camps in earlier years. The biggest group (75 %) consists of people who fought for their lords only once. They just did their duty and were unwilling to be exiled or outcast. Only 4 participants of the battle changed their political views, so the treason was an unlikely behavior during the period of the Wars of the Roses.

AB Football has become much more than a simple game over the past hundred years. Football has become a factor in global policy, affecting not only the minds and souls of hundreds of millions of fans, but also the political, economic, and social aspects of modern life. This interview with M. Prozumshchikov, the leading researcher of Russian sports and one of the editors of the collection of documents revealed from the Russian State Archive of Recent History, was invited to talk about the creation of the Soviet system of party control over big sport (and, above all, over football), about the views of the leaders of the USSR on the possibility of using football for ideological purposes, and about the role of the Soviet state in the support and development of the mass football movement. The issues of the archival system of documents on sports in the USSR were also touched upon. At the very beginning, the history of the rise of a line of publications dedicated to sport mega-events involving Soviet athletes such as the 1980 Summer Olympics, the 2014 Winter Olympic Games, and big football matches was discussed. Furthermore, the researcher talked about the difficulties associated with finding relevant documents about Soviet sport in the existing archival landscape of modern Russia. The main part of the conversation was devoted to the structural problems of national sport, beginning with the early USSR and ending with the disintegration of the state sport system under M. Gorbachev. The most important problems of the sports movement in the Soviet Union, such as the internationalization of Soviet sport, in general, and the sport relations with the countries of the Socialist Block, in particular, as well as the balance of power between the Central Committee and the Sports Committee and other significant actors of this field, the trivial nationalism in the bleachers at the Soviet stadiums, and other topics were also discussed. The interview ends with a discussion of the prospects for historical sports research.

AB This article discusses the problems that arise in the course of theoretical conceptualization and philosophical interpretation of the activities of justice system representatives. The questions of socio-cultural, historical and political traditions and value determination of the administration of justice are discussed, as well as their dependence on the philosophies of Hegel and Charles Peirce, in particular, on peculiarities of the key definitions of epistemological categories. The said activities are analyzed in the context of the assumption that the criminal process is a social technology. There are two competing strategies in (use of) social technologies, one of which is based on the ideals of theoretical reason, historicism and utopian social engineering, while the second prefers the daily and pragmatic rationality and gradual (realistic) social engineering. The thesis is argued, that these two social technologies are rooted in the corresponding cultures of knowledge: sciences and the humanities, respectively, which are implicitly present in political institutions and law enforcement, providing them a very significant impact.

AB The paper investigates the problems of interconnection between performing arts, politics and the machinery of state, based on works of the famous French philosopher-post-modernist A. Badiou. The analogy between theatre and politics, proposed by him, analyzed when applied to Russian culture and interaction with political realia of past and present. An attempt is made to compare politics and theatre as phenomena that have much in common from the conceptual, structural and functional points of view. The paper also brings up the problem of the status and the role of a person and a society at large as components of creative process, some aspects concerning the extent of influence that theatre makes on both individual consciousness and collective thinking and their view of the world.

AB The article is devoted to the problems of regional positioning as the most important factor in the growth of the symbolic potential of the state, whose political and social communities are interested in the sustainable and progressive development of their territories. The authors, based on the results of the conducted research, assess the progress in the semantic fields of the attractive image of the Tyumen region. Image models are considered for the purpose of revealing the similarities and differences in the characteristics expressed in them. It is established that the objective image integrates positive and problem manifestations of regional reality. In subjective constructions, negative aspects do not find fixation. The dynamics in the perception of the Tyumen region by the population of Russia is revealed. In the matrix of mental design there are many new associates replacing part of the core brand of hydrocarbon specialization and referring to the diversification of the economy, its innovative restructuring, historical and cultural heritage, sports and scientific achievements, and tourism opportunities. In the representations of citizens of the CIS countries, the uniqueness of the Tyumen region is associated with the exportraw material supply, as well as a capacious labor market, favorable conditions for training, life, self-realization. The European countries do not have the necessary level of recognition of the region. The oil and gas component in Western societies is more closely associated with the image of the Russian Federation as a whole as an energy power. The set of image features is reduced to the limits of immersion in business, educational, sports and other communications within the framework of international cooperation.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE social democracy; utopia; Marxism; democratic socialism; "third way";
   "New Labour"
AB The article is devoted to the analysis of the combination of utopian and realistic components in the ideology of the European social democracy. The author demonstrates that during the 20th century social democracy abandoned many utopian ideas and illusions. In the end of the 19th-first half of the 20th century the European social democratic parties (except for the British Labour Party) utilized Marxism as their dominant ideology, in that dogmatized form that it received from F. Engels, K. Kautsky and G. Plekhanov, although even at that time a number of provisions of Marxist doctrine were called into question by the representatives of the revisionist forces led by E. Bernstein. During the subsequent de-radicalization, social democrats in fact switched to the positions of social reformism. In the 1950s, they abandoned many of the Marxist postulates and proclaimed their commitment to ethical socialism within mixed economy. In the late 1970s, the fact that the Keynesian socio-economic model that they created sailed into the crisis aggravated the trend towards de-radicalization of social democratic parties, which manifested itself in the strengthening of the pro-market wing. The most active processes of ideological modernization unfolded in the British Labour Party and the Social Democratic Party of Germany, resulting in the emergence of a "new" social democracy (T. Blair's "New Labour", G. Schroder's "Neue Mitte"). However, the 2008 global financial-economic crisis interrupted the movement of the European social democracy towards social liberalism, and in the 2010s social democratic parties again largely returned to their traditional agenda. According to the author's assessment, the recent "left turn" of the social democracy indicates that it is not able to fully switch to market pragmatism and still needs "Utopia-Hope".

DT Article

   social knowledge; multiculturalism; political doctrines
AB The article considers the phenomenon of social science debates in the form of the opposition 'West/Non-West' and its social-political and identification consequences. The authors focus on the history of this opposition, the ways to overcome the scientific and social confrontations that were determined by it, and on the methodological significance of the concept `Non-Western theories'. The authors study the features of social and political knowledge of the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America; compare social values of Western Europe, China and other countries to identify the ways for its integration in the course of postcolonial political and scientific development. In particular, the article compares the axio logical triad of T. Heuss (democracy, Roman law, Christian ethics) and the Chinese dyad - the will of the people (minxin suoxiang) and three convents (sangang). Within the West/Non-West opposition, the Western European, Chinese, Japanese, Indian, African, Latin-American social-political constructs are considered to assess the productivity of some categorical oppositions and contaminations adopted in the sphere of social knowledge and to prove the theoretical inconsistency of multiculturalism. The authors also consider the issues of eurocentrism and Western-European messianism on the examples of their relationship with Sino-Centrism, and the ideas of African and Latin-American nationalism. Such comparisons prove the metatheoretical status of the West/Non-West' opposition that can be explained within the paradigm of the social construction of reality. The authors conclude that the concepts 'West' and 'Non-West' do not have a truly scientific status; they are rather markers of social values claiming a special identification value, i.e. having a direct relation to self-representation. The concepts 'West' and 'Non-West' are a kind of political declarations tather than an evidence of epistemological differences in the foundations of social knowledge in different parts of the globe.

DE International relations; modeling; political studies
AB In general, in the theory of international relations, there are a number of the most common modeling methods. Logical-deductive models based on theoretical assumptions about the object under study are often used in theoretical research and comparative typological generalizations. The basis of theoretical modeling variability is political science development through change and competition of paradigms. Representations of the subject, methodological principles, characteristics of problems and empirical tools of political research are grouped according to ideological preferences, maintenance of the power structure within a scientific discipline and perpetuating the established order. The aim of the paper is to describe the modeling methodology in the field of international relations theories. The overview of classic paradigms of international relations has shown the absence of the adequate ones for a bilateral relationship analysis. However, the theory of modeling and a scenario approach has a high prognostic potential for bilateral relations studies.
   In addition to theoretical and analytical modeling in the theory of international relations, empirical-oriented models have been developed significantly. They tend to use a large amount of empirical data and a great number of quantitative statistical methods of mathematical analysis. The construction of such models is often considered as a stage of general analysis, which assumes the formalization and mathematical expression of basic elements and relationships of the objects under study. Mathematical models have significant advantages from the point of view of specifying and clarifying conclusions and increasing analysis and generalization complexity.

It divided the methods of foreign policy of countries into hard and soft. The first group of methods includes armed violence, military intervention, economic pressure, bribery. The second group of methods is attractiveness of economic growth and well-being of the population, creative power of the nation, attractive foreign policy strategy, culture, and science. Along with political, economic, military methods of influence, no less important are methods, related to education, science, mass information and culture. Considering the rich history of Russia's cultural influence on Mongolia in the socialist period, cooperation in this area seems promising and significant for modern Russian-Mongolian relations. Among the positive grounds for the successful use of Russian education as an instrument of foreign policy influence towards Mongolia are the historical tradition of involving Mongolian citizens in the system of higher education of the Soviet Union, the Russian language that relatively widely spread in Mongolia, the presence of branches of several Russian universities of Moscow, Ulan-Ude, and Irkutsk in Mongolia. At the same time, there is a number of impediments related to successful use of education as an instrument of Russia's foreign policy in Mongolia.

AB The research contains an analysis of the U.S. state environmental policy development in the second half of the 19th century and in the 20th century (up to early 1980s), which proceeded under the influence and with direct involvement of the American Conservationist Movement (later transformed into the American Green Movement). The author scrutinizes stages and milestones of the U.S. environmental legislation elaboration, state environmental policies under different presidential administrations up to the "turning point" (Ronald Reagan's election in 1981). Despite the traditional acute struggle for power between the two main U.S. political players - the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, presidential administrations of either had considered the nature protection activities an important integral part of domestic policy by default. By the beginning of 1980s, the American federal environmental legislation regulated the following issues: wilderness preservation; control over public fresh water systems, toxic agents, pesticide use; ocean dumping of shore-generated waste; rivers protection; cleaning of territory from radioactive wastes; pollutions scientific research; standard setting; ecological monitoring; law enforcement. Attention was also paid to acid rains, air visibility and global warming issues. The greatest part of currently functioning state environmental protection agencies had been created before the early 1980s boundary. The situation underwent a 180-degree turn in 1981 when President-Republican Ronald Reagan entered the office. Hence, the Republican Party representatives in power demonstrated a solely pragmatic approach to the environmental protection prioritizing the economic benefit. A correlation between the United States' historical development, specifics of the U.S. domestic environmental policy and its impact on the international environmental protection activities are also traced in the article.

ID NEOPATRIMONIAL REGIMES; TRANSITIONS
AB Hybrid regimes, which combine democratic institutions, to some extent cosmetic, with real authoritarian relations and orders, strikingly differ in their stability. Under such regimes the non-institutionalized conflict dynamics becomes crucial, because power issues are not solved through open political competition during elections. The article sketches a model of interaction between The Regime and The Protest, which includes 10 postulates on the basis of the results of the synthesis studies. The author shows that if these postulates are correct, a sufficiently flexible hybrid regime, which is able to adapt, inevitably slips to neo-totalitarianism in accordance with the principle of a ratchet mechanism. Neo-totalitarian practices, as well as the relationship between bureaucratic institutions and neo-patrimonial orders, were shown to exert an ambiguous influence upon the stability of hybrid regimes.
   Some modern hybrid regimes are quite stable (post-revolutionary Iran, Kazakhstan under Nursultan Nazarbayev, Russia under Vladimir Putin, etc.). There are also regimes characterized by the intermittent and unstable dynamics (Russia in the 1990s, Egypt after Tahrir, Venezuela after Hugo Chavez' death, etc.). Each of these cases provides an empirical basis for testing the presented model. In its turn, this model opens up opportunities for analyzing reasons for the success and failure of the regime and protest strategies, for explaining the significant diversity in the nature and stability of the regimes, for identifying the conditions, scale and effects of neo-totalitarian practices and institutions, and for monitoring socio-political dynamics and predicting its trajectories.

DT Article
DE forest; USSR; Finland; Sweden; Europe; export; 1930s
AB The article examines the economic and political role of the USSR's timber exports at the turn of the 1920s and 1930s. Solving the problem of obtaining currency for the implementation of ambitious programs for the restoration and modernization of industry throughout the 1920-1930s remained a priority for the political leadership of the USSR. Forest exports became one of the ways to replenish foreign exchange reserves, although not immediately. The USSR in the specified period tried to agree with its direct competitors, i.e., Finland and Sweden, on establishing beneficial prices for all the parties. The situation in the European forest market in 1931-1932 seriously aggravated receipt of significant quantities of goods from Poland and North America. As a result, the problem reached a completely different level with the League of Nations secretariat attempting to find ways out of the crisis. Representatives of England, France, Germany, Sweden, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Finland and the USSR were invited to discuss the problem in Geneva. It was decided to include discussion of this problem in the discussion program at the London Economic Conference in 1933. At international negotiations in Copenhagen in 1935, market shares were determined for the USSR, Finland, Sweden, Poland, Austria, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia. The signed contract entered into force on December 1, 1935.

DT Article
DE Foreign policy; USSR; Finland; Marshall plan; economic cooperation;
   reparations
AB This article analyzes the reasons that prompted the Soviet Union to pressure the Finnish government refuse from participation in the Marshall plan. Special attention is paid to the distinct positions of Finnish President J. K. Paasikivi and the government of Finland headed by M.Pekkala. Business circles perceived the Marshall plan positively, because it was seen as providing an additional impetus to European integration and to growth of the European economy. President Paasikivi considered it primarily to be a basis for overcoming the strong influence of the Soviet Union. However, the government ignored the opinion of the majority faction of Parliament, being afraid of Moscow's negative reaction of Moscow; therefore, ratification of the peace treaty by the Soviet side could be delayed, and calculations to facilitate reparation payments were unrealizable. Finland's forced refusal to participate in the Marshall Plan was the first serious obstacle to participating in the process of European integration that was gradually gaining momentum. Having gained this from the Finnish government, the Soviet side actually assumed certain obligations that partially compensated Finland for economic losses, but fulfilling the volume of these for for political goals became a significant burden over time.

AB This article considers the history of Soviet-American relations on the Korean issue in the period of their development in the format of bilateral negotiations (1943-1947). The author aims to characterise the content and principles of the organisation of the dialogue between Moscow and Washington on the Korean issue during World War II and the postwar settlement, and to reveal the influence of this interaction on the fate of Korea.
   The author analyses the content of the dialogue between Moscow and Washington at the Tehran, Yalta and Potsdam conferences, describes the decision-making process on Korea at the Moscow meeting of foreign ministers in 1945, and examines the work of the Joint Soviet-American Commission, and the interaction between the Soviet and American occupation zones on the peninsula.
   The analysis is carried out with reference to published and unpublished documents of the diplomatic departments of the USSR and the US (including materials of the Foreign Policy Archive of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, and Internet archives), declassified CIA materials, and memoirs of political establishment members.
   The research allows the author to conclude that the fixation of the Korean division in 1948 occurred despite the original aspirations of the superpowers, but it became a logical outcome of the Korean settlement process. After the liberation of Korea, the USSR and the United States failed to build effective cooperation in the complex internal political conditions of the peninsula. In the end, Washington decided to choose the path that led to the implementation of a fundamentally new scenario, i.e. the formation of an independent South Korean state.

DE Archival materials; sources; history of festival movement; World
   Festival of Youth and Students; All-Union Festival of Soviet Youth;
   festival
AB The article assesses archival materials on the :festival movement in the Soviet Union in 1950s, including its peak, the 6th World Festival of Youth and Students held in Moscoii in 1957. Even now the Moscoii festival is seen in the context of international cultural politics of the Cold War and as a unique event for the Soviet Union. The article is to put the 6th World Festival of Youth and Students in the context of other youth festivals held in the Soviet Union. The festivals of 1950s provided a field for political, social, and cultural experiments. They also were the crucible of a new way of communication and a new language of design. Furthermore, festivals reflected the new (althogh relative) liberalism in the Soviet Union. This liberalism, first of all, kvas expressed in the fact that festivals were organized by the Komsomol and other Soviet public and cultural organisations. Taking the role of these organisations into consideration, the research draws on the documents of the Ministry of Culture, the All Russian Stage Society, as well as personal documents of the artists. Furthermore, the author has gained access to new archive materials, which have until now been part of no research, such as documents of the N. Krupskaya Central Culture and Art Center and of the central committees of various artistic trade unions. These documents confirm the hypothesis that the festivals provided the Komsomol and the Communist party with a means to address various social, educational, and cultural problems. For instance, in Central Asia with its partiarehal society, the festivals focuced on female emancipation. In rural Central Asia, as well as in other non-Russian parts of the Soviet Union, there co-existed different Ways of celebrating. Local traditions intermingled with cultural standards prescribed by Moscow. At the first glance, the modernisation of the Soviet society was succesful. The Youth acquired political and cultural level that allowed the Soviet state to compete with the West during the 6th World Festival of Youth and Students. During the festival, however, it became apparent, that the Soviet cultural scheme no longer met the dictates of times. Archival documents show that after the Festival cultural and party officials agreed to ease off dogmatism and to tolerate some of the foreign cultural phenomena.

   COMMUNITY OF READERS

LA Russian
DT Article
DE political protest; Alexander II; revolutionary populism; reading
   practices
AB The article attempts, through the study of reading practices, to take a fresh look at the revolutionary populism of the 1870s as a community of readers united not by common ideological guidelines, but by the gesture of reading protest literature. The introductory part offers a brief overview of the historiography of reading practices and explains the relevance of the approach to the study of revolutionary populism. The essay focuses on youth/student clubs' members reading banned literature in the provincial cities of the Russian Empire. The study shows a variety of texts circulating among young people. Their content cannot be reduced either to the three tendencies of populism traditionally distinguished in the historiography, or to the socialist literature "in general". A complex mixture of protest writings created a bizarre metatext not always accessible to the understanding of those who appealed to it. The main sources that make it possible to consider reading practices in detail are the materials of pedagogical meetings, mainly of theological seminaries, that used to discuss such actions. Unlike the documents of the political police, which recorded the fact of committing a "crime", the analyzed texts contain observations of the degree of "corruption" of a reader, i.e. the depth of one's acceptance of the texts read and their influence on students' behavior. Studying reading practices gives us the possibility to consider a broader question of the nature of the youth movement of the 1870s and the role played by illegal literature in its formation. Such approach makes it possible to expand the boundaries of the revolutionary community, shifting from its active center to the periphery, and to speak rather of youth political protest than of the revolutionary movement.

AB The article is to display the works of outstanding French artist and public figure of the XIX century Alexander Vattemare (1796-1864). It reveals little-known facts of his biography, reflecting the powerful socioeconomic and political changes of the era of the French Revolutions. Vattemare amazed his contemporaries with virtuosic acting technique using the scenic reception of transformation - a rapid change in appearance. The fashion for the theatrical transformations is associated with the flowering of oneact vaudevilles with disguises on a French stage. Sensational numbers went to concert estrada as a "new attraction" in the beginning of the XIX century. Alexander Vattemare supplemented the impression with plasticity, intonation, witty lyrics and masterfully performing of the couplets and owned ventrology. The tour of Vattemare in Russia in 1834 became a great success. Sharp and funny scenes, reviews, where all the roles played by Alexander Vattemare, reflected the spirit and mores of his time. Under the influence of the acting skills of Vattemare, new traditions in the performance of short stories and "small forms" of drama developed in the "divertissements" and "intermissions" of the Imperial theatres. Short stories and small dramatic works were not simply read by artists, but "played in faces", using transformation.

This new understanding for what was Soviet African Studies in the 1960s can be obtained now through thorough analyses of the new declassified archive documents from the Russian Foreign Policy Archive available today. These documents testify that the level of understanding of what was going on in Black Africa was not adequate to African realities and could not inspire the practical deeds of Soviet foreign policy in Africa.

AB The article explores some medieval interpretations of Aristotelian ideas of true and false statements and, consequently, of lying and the concealment of truth (which was not considered a mortal sin, unlike the former). The author looks into text by the late medieval theologians and canonists and traces their links to the 16th century Catholic philosophers and pamphleteers - Domingo be Soto, Navarrus, and English Jesuits. It has been shown that medieval reception of Aristotelian ideas, particularly active within the Nominalist philosophical tradition helped develop the early Modern moral theology, and the concepts of mental reservation and equivocation, which were important to the history of philosophy, political theory and religious practice in the 16th - 17th cc.

LA English
DT Article
DE constitutional law; constitutional court; countermajoritarian
   institutions; constitutional stability; president; Russian Constitution
AB The article enriches the discussion on the legal reasons and conditions fostering the viability of democratic constitutions by analyzing the rich experience of the Russian Constitution of 1993. Particular attention is paid to the concept of countermajoritarian institutions. The authors elaborate the idea that countermajoritarian institutions can play an important role in ensuring the viability (put in other terms, the proper balance between stability, adaptability, and dynamic development) of modern democratic constitutions as well as political regimes.
   The article presents evidence-based data showing that the President and the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation systematically acted as countermajoritarian institutions at the initial stage of the implementation of the "blueprint for the future" set down in the 1993 Russian Constitution. As a result of the activities of these institutions, strong legal frameworks were created that are necessary for the establishment of a new constitutional system of the Russian state and law.
   Today, the Russian Constitution of 1993 is one of the longest lasting democratic constitutions in the world (the average "life expectancy" of democratic constitutions adopted over the past 250 years is about seventeen years). The study of the countermajoritarian provisions in the 1993 Russian Constitution is of both theoretical and practical importance. In particular, the results of the study can be useful in creating efficient legal instruments for the maintenance of political stability and social development management both within sovereign states and within interstate communities.

DE Latin-American's liberalism; Russian America; Juan Bustamante;
   autocracy; romanticism; utopian socialism
AB Latin America is one of the most remote from Russian regions in the world. Our relationships were established only in the twentieth century. Before that, despite the huge mutual interest, contacts between the Russians and the South Americans were insignificant, and the reason was not only geographical, but also political obstacles, in particular the persistent refusal of the Imperial government of St. Petersburg to recognize the American Republic, the former "rebel" province of the Spanish monarchy. Meanwhile, there was a great interest to Russia on the part of Latin-Americans. Only a few of them were able to see the real Russian Empire with their own eyes. Only the prominent Peruvian social activist and revolutionary, Juan Bustamante, one of the forerunners of socialism visited our country, and remaining fascinated not only by country, but, paradoxically, by its political system. Such an original view on the Russian Empire sharply distinguishes Bustamante from his European contemporaries.

AB It is long enough since the end of the "Russian 20th century" - Russia's withdrawal from the communist formation - for thorough understanding and arguing on what economic and social order it has finally come to. Books are being published, serious articles appear, round-tables are being held. Different opinions collide. Re-evaluation of views and values is going on. For many people, these past decades are peculiar, familiar, aching, experienced. One of the latest published books is a collective work of three well-known scientists, employees of the European University at Saint Petersburg, a merited research center. The authors of the book - Dmitrii Travin, Vladimir Gel'man and Andrei Zaostrovtsev - have introduced a thorough and distinctive analysis of problems which emerged and were left unsold on the path traveled, and of the pathway itself that does not fit into the concept of the final stage of world transit to the market and democracy. Their views and conclusions echo closely to perceptions of other eminent scientists and parties involved in the events: Aleksandr Yakovlev, Grigorii Yavlinskii, Yurii Pivovarov, Anatolii Vishnevskii, Mikhail Gefter et al. This article represents an interchange of researchers' views on open problems of the modern Russia's path which is not yet traveled. In particular, these are specifically compiled elements of the path where reforms were implemented: ideas, interests, institutions, illusions; the main historical curve on the way - a pivot from the communist regime to a new authoritarianism; a fundamental difference between policy. politics disappearing in Russian translation; political and economic phenomenon of power ownership; collision between the European development pathway and the "Eurasian pathway" mythologema, etc. The concluding subject comprises unobvious perspectives of tomorrow: depletion of resources of an unshaped social contract between power and population; a danger of restoration process - the dead end of development; limited social and political capacities of returning to the reform path; collapse of economic system, large-scale crisis of state and society, etc.

SO HERALD OF AN ARCHIVIST
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Ataman Semenov; source base; documents; politics; counter-revolution;
   Transbaikalia; Japan
AB The publication introduces into scientific use six unique documents concerning political actions of G. M. Semenov in August 1920 and analyses them. At the time, Semyonov was formally Commander-in-Chief of all armed forces and Field Ataman of all Cossack troops of the Russian Eastern outskirts. He presented himself as are successor to Admiral Alexander Kolchak, Supreme Ruler of Russia and Leader of the counter-revolution in the Russian Far East. Documents are deposited in the State Archive of the Russian Federation (fond of the Council of People's Commissars) and in the State Archive of the Novosibirsk Region (fond of the Siberian Bureau of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and that of the Siberian Revolutionary Committee). Five out of six documents have been classified and unavailable to researchers for decades. The article reviews Soviet and postSoviet historiography touching upon Semyonov's biography, his military and political activities, notes an abundance of publications of all genres and a great variety of opinions on key issues, and concludes that a further widening of the source base is necessary for an adequate representation of the Ataman as a political actor and to explain 'the phenomenon of Semyonov.' The publication serves this end and shows a surprising side of Semyonov. The documents contain information communicated by Semyonov to the Bolshevik leaders though different channels: on the Ataman's intent to avoid participation in the formation of the Far Eastern Republic, to come over to the Soviets, and even to join the Red Army in order to fight Japan. He explained his shift of stance from anti-Soviet to pro-Soviet as born from his patriotism and inspired by General Aleksei Brusilov's example. However, these arguments did not deceive the Bolshevik leaders, experienced politicians as they were; they understood that Semyonov's 'zigzag' was brought about by forfeited Japanese support. The reply of the Red Army Leader L. D. Trotsky shattered Semyonov's illusions: amnesty was only possible if he arrived in Moscow accompanied by the appointees of the Siberian Revolutionary Committee chairman. Semyonov's initiative prompted Bolshevik leaders to redouble their efforts to combat propaganda in areas controlled by the Ataman. Soviet press and democratic newspapers of the Far East informed the population how the Ataman requested Trotsky to let him join the Red Army, thus tarnishing Semyonov's reputation. The Ataman's scam was in vain, and, moreover, put him on the back foot.

AB The paper is focused on the problem of involving population in contemporary processes of digitalization of the society. It pays additional attention to the ways men and women follow this tendency and considers different practices of using information and communication technologies like gender and other social and economic characteristics of people: age, occupation, level of education, marital status, income, and expenses. As a data source we use the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey that represents the Russian population and includes more than eight hundred variables in different scales for individuals and about the same number for households. The methodology of the research is based on various statistical methods like clustering, decision trees, and index construction techniques. It was expected that there is no significant difference between men and women at the level of the Internet use in the countries with modern economics and political system, and we have got the evidence for this statement in the case of Russian Federation. At the same time, the research shows that there is a substantial difference in the variability around this level between men and women in the particular groups of population. The possible explanation for the phenomenon of the greater differentiation of women salary for users of digital technologies was given, and the additional peculiarities of gender influence on this was analyzed. To provide the effective way to new digital society in creating the information support for decision makers, gender should be taken into account.

AB The article focusses on how the body is constructed for immunology. Specifically, the complex and tangled bio-political genealogy of immunity is analysed in detail as the understanding of it hovers between social and biological discourses. In addition, the controversy between different models of the immune system is examined. The social studies of immunology conducted by Donna Haraway and Emily Martin are also highlighted. In these studies, the body-immune system is understood as a diversified heterogeneous construction consisting of components belonging to different ontological orders. The construction of the immune system does not end in the laboratory or in the clinic. It continues in other places by other means. Nevertheless, the relationship between the body and the immune system is situational: the immune system could be completely identified with the body or be a part of it.
   Emily Martin's ethnography of immune systems and Donna Haraway's feminist anthropology provide the means for understanding how the immune system, as both academics and non-academics explain it, can be juxtaposed to and also coincide with the body and even the self, but nevertheless conform to the scale, concepts, laws and metaphors of the social world of everyday life. The immune system and immunity are assessed in terms of the physiological body and the self. On the other hand, the body as a biological "self " is abstracted from the physiological and social body, and in a sense it "lives a life of its own." Therefore, our body is the outcome of a complex coordinating effort among different bodies: the physiological body, the one identified with the self, and the body on a different scale - the biological "self " which turns out to be "non-self " and not belong to the subject.

AB The review of the monograph by J. Stahl presents to Russian readership the author's views on the process of development of the American political culture in the second half of the 20th century and in the first decade of the 21st century. According J. Stahl, during this period, the "right move" took place in the U.S., and its ideological support was carried out by American think tanks. The relevance of J. Stahl's work consists in setting the new trends in the development of American political culture in the period under study, which extended American conservative traditions and values and disseminated them to all spheres of public life in the United States. In our opinion, based on the principle of historicism, the work under review represents a new contribution to studying American political culture In the western historiography. As for our critical remarks, they consist in the author's underestimation of the analysis of value-normative factors in the post-war development of the American political culture, when the political consciousness as well as the political behavior of the American political and intellectual elite had changed.

Despite some transformations in the municipal sphere, certain objectives of Russia's municipal reform have not been realized. This article describes the reasons for permanent reform of local government in the plane of standard and legal character, the financial and economic limitations of the municipality, and the low activity of self-organization of citizens. Moreover, authors provide the results of a public poll regarding the reform of the local self-government and give an assessment of the results of the reforms undertaken and define the existing problems and prospects of developing local government as objectives of this research. Authors concluded that the existing system of local self-government needs modernization and should be based on certain strategy and tactics involving historical approach and analysis of current socioeconomic conditions for future progress.

DE discourse classification; types of discourse; hybrid format;
   military-political discourse; military-publicistic discourse
AB The article deals with a relevant linguistic issue of discourse typology. The authors pay special attention to the place of hybrid discourse formats in discourse classification. The study focuses on structural properties of hybrid discourse formats and is aimed at characterizing their peculiarities and typological features. The study is based on the material of military-political and military media US discourses that concern the Middle East problem: Iraq (2002-2005) and Syria (2012-2015) Wars. The material is investigated through typological, comparative and critical discourse analysis methods. Discourse description is based on the list of components developed by V. I. Karasik. The list consists of participants, chronotope, aims, values, strategies, materials, genres, precedent texts and discourse formulae. The hybrid formats are a combination of base discourses (military, political, media discourses). Military discourse determines the conceptual components of hybrid formats, while political and media discourses characterize their content-related components. The authors argue that such inter-discourse relations cannot be treated as a mere discourse overlapping: the mutual penetration and integration of characteristics generate a completely new discourse type that is not equal to a simple sum of the parts. The authors come to the conclusion that despite a common discourse base and a number of integral components (chronotope, strategies, "discourse traps", topics, genres, precedent texts, discursive formulae) military-political and military media discourses are completely different in terms of such key components as agents, aims and values. The results of the study are of interest to a wide range of Russian and foreign specialists in discourse analysis, political linguistic, political science, international relations and international law. They can be applied to teaching these disciplines at institutions of higher education.

AB The future is one of the implicit categories of political discourse. Any event occurs in the course of a very long duration of time through the structuring effects of social and political relations. Time is inseparable from human beings: it models them as social beings, and they, in turn, model time, so there is always a desire to foresee or to anticipate future events. In political discourse, forecasts, scenarios and models of the future are powerful means of influencing the addressee. Models of the future and their interpretation require certain conceptual operations. Linguistic political prognostics is a new branch in the study of political discourse that involves the integration of future studies, political science, and cognitive linguistics. The material for the construction of models of the future is prognostic texts of various chronological periods. The key unit of knowledge is considered to be a cognitive metaphor. The article presents a piece of the study of the retrospective models of the future of Russia. The material is prognostic texts of American political discourse of the XIXth century (1855-1881). Retrospective analysis allows one to penetrate into the past and study it, as well as to look through the text at the part of the past reality that lies behind the text. Historical analogies can help in solving the problems facing the modern state. (c) 2018 Published by Future Academy www.FutureAcademy.org.UK

   Political Funds Control Law; political scandals; the Recruit scandal;
   political reform
AB The phenomenon of political corruption in Japan during the "1955 system" manifested itself in the shady nature of most financial flows ensuring the functioning of the system of one-party rule by the LDP. This shady system of financing essentially contradicted the spirit of the Political Funds Control Law and the Public Offices Election Law.
   It was almost impossible for the LDP MPs to ensure the functioning of their "political machines" without acquiring extraordinarily large monetary funds, so a significant part of them had to be obtained from dubious sources. As a result, political scandals erupted in Japan from time to time (the Lockheed scandal, the Recruit scandal, the Sagawa Kyubin scandal), revealing the enormous scale of violations of these norms and restrictions by politicians, as well as their regular abuse of political funds.
   At the same time, legal regulation of political funds was significantly more stringent regarding political parties, as compared to other organizations involved in political activities, including LDP factions and personal political structures maintained by individual politicians. Anticorruption laws were extremely vague in content and had many loopholes making it easy to evade them. They became an effective tool against corruption only after the radical political reform of 1994.
   The ethno-psychological peculiarities of the Japanese people also played a certain role in the spread of political corruption. In particular, it was the public opinion's tolerance for moderate manifestations of corruption and the willingness to forgive those responsible if they show external signs of repentance. In addition, the weakness and fragmentation of the opposition, which prevented political scandals from having large-scale and painful consequences for the LDP, was a significant factor as well. The LDP got away with a lot of things because the opposition parties did not provide the voters with a real political alternative, and because their leaders were also involved in corruption scandals.

AB Introduction: the article presents a pioneering attempt in the Russian historiography for a scientific analysis of research activities on the study of indigenous people of the North living in the Arctic Districts of Yakutia in the 1980s.
   Objective: to reconstruct the history of realization of research initiatives; to identify their values and the main features.
   Research materials: the research is based on the involving a range of source materials stored in the archives of Yakutsk, Saint-Petersburg and Moscow, as well as scientific literature.
   Results and novelty of the research: the author has identified and examined the main research initiatives implemented in PolarYakutia in the designated chronological framework. In this regard, their personal composition, conducting methods, geography and main directions are indicated. The main provisions developed by the participants of these initiatives are considered. The author has found that under the influence of the development of scientific thought and research methodology, as well as changes in the socially-political situation in the Soviet Union in the 1980s. of XX century, in the "structure" of research activities relating to the indigenous people of the North of Yakutia, major changes have taken place. During this period, the first in the history of genetic and demographic research, the original and Kolyma linguistic-ethnographic expedition were conducted, as well as a scientific report "Nature and Trends in the Development of Socially-Cultural and Language Processes among the Nationalities of the North of Yakutia" has been prepared, which in fact has become a "bridge"connecting two periods in assessing the influence of Soviet practices on the fate of aboriginal ethnicities of the Arctic. At the same time, the "traditional" directions of the researches related to folklore and the indigenous languages were developed, although here, as it was established, the fourth complex folklore expedition stands apart in historical retrospect.

DE expert community; expert seminars; authorities
AB The article is devoted to the experience of the functioning in Russia of public expert seminars on the problems of the socio-political life of the country as a platform for interaction between the authorities and the expert community, as well as within the community itself. The first section briefly describes the history of the emergence of a prototype of such seminars in the late USSR, which is interpreted by the author as the birth of a private-public sphere under the conditions of a strict party control over the public sphere. The second section discusses the development of public-political clubs of the perestroika period and their role in expanding the public sphere and recruiting future political and public figures. The third section covers the 1990s. The author shows that at the beginning of that decade the Russian authorities were open to interaction with the expert community more than ever. He proposes a hypothesis that such openness can be explained (at least partly) by the arrival of a new team in the government that included many people from the academic world.
   The last section presents a comparative analysis of the three expert seminars that were most active in the first half of the 2000s - the seminars of the clubs "Civil Debates" and "Open Forum", as well as the seminar "Politeia". One of the most important tasks set by their initiators was the formation of an open expert environment, accumulating the expert potential scattered in the bureaucratic, business and public structures, and overcoming the split of the national elite into micro-communities that hardly contact with each other. However, it was not possible to solve these tasks, and the activities of the seminars gradually came to naught.

AB The article is devoted to the study of territorial conflicts in two countries of the former USSR - Moldova and Estonia in 1989-1994. Within the framework of the study, we conducted five expert interviews with respondents, who was directly involved in resolving the conflicts in Chisinau, Transnistria and Gagauzia. The publications in Internet publications about the referendum in Narva in 1993, its preparation and consequences were also analyzed. Based on the conducted research, it was revealed that on the eve of the referendum on autonomy in Narva, authorities of Estonia and the administration of the city council of Narva visited Moldova, including Transnistria. This experience of the conflict in Transnistria let them take certain steps to ease tensions in Eastern Estonia. Later, this Estonian experience was already applied by Moldovan politicians in the process of relieving tension in the situation of Gagauzia. The detected interaction of political elites of Moldova and Transnistria is viewed from the perspective of the concept of "policy learning" by Hugh Heclo and Richard Rose.

AB Throughout all Caucasian war mountain communities of the Northwest Caucasus kept their demographic potential. However, for a variety of reasons after military defeat they could not (or did not want) to adapt to the new situation in the quality of subjects of the Russian Empire. On transition from war to peace a vast majority of mountaineers of this subregion of Caucasus between the existing alternatives chose emigration. This decision and the following departure to the Ottoman Porte provoked cardinal ethnodemographic transformation of all Northwest Caucasus. For the mountaineers emigration ended up the huge number of victims (25-30 % of all immigrants died on the way). In the article information from different authors about scales of migration of various mountain communities and the losses suffered by them was used.
   Further demographic, socio-political, sociocultural dynamics of mountain communities confirmed that those from them that preferred to stay in the North Caucasus historically won. However, this historical prize became completely obvious only in the second quarter of the 20th century, in many decades after completion of the Caucasian war.

AB This essay is devoted to the analysis of the book by A.V. Gladyshev "The worlds of CL-H. de Saint-Simon. Between Napoleon and Louis XVIII". The subject of the monograph is the life and ideas of Saint-Simon in the context of the Bourbon Restoration period 1814-1816. Applying interdisciplinary methodology, Gladyshev revisited the opinion widely spread in the Russian and foreign historiography concerning an intellectual heritage of Saint-Simon and the period of Restoration as a whole. The period of Restoration is presented by Gladyshev as a time of turmoil, accelerating the processes of developing of new ideas and forming of political ideologies. Saint-Simon immediately participated in this process of institutionalizing a post-revolutionary France. The work demonstrates the evolution of the perception of the intellectual heritage of Saint-Simon from the 19th till 21th centuries. If contemporaries perceived his ideas as eccentric projects, the twentieth century historians interpreted him as a prophet of the Entente, the European Union, industrial society, positivism and social partnership.

AB The formation of Historical Germanistics at Kemerovo State University began in the late 1980s under the guidance of candidates of historical sciences, associate professors Y.V. Galaktionov and L.N. Korneva, who in turn were students of the famous Tomsk historian N.S. Cherkasov. Presently, German history studies is one of the leading scientific direction of the Department of World History and Socio-Political Sciences of Kemerovo State University.
   The purpose of the article is to consider the development of studying of German history in the faculty of History at Kemerovo State University. The sources of the research are the works of the members of the Department of World History and Socio-Political Sciences of Kemerovo State University: dissertations, monographs, articles, manuals.
   The specific of German history studies at the Kemerovo University was originally determined by the founders of Historical Germanistics school, who were interested in the Russian and German historiography of German National Socialism, the historiographic problems of the theory of totalitarianism. The recognized expert on the Russian historiography of German fascism Y.V. Galaktionov in his works analysed its various aspects from origins until the 1990s. L.N. Korneva analysed in detail the German historiography of National Socialism of the second half of XX - beginning of XXI centuries. The works of E.V. Moroz and N.G. Kostromina are devoted to the historiography of totalitarianism. The German historiography of the "conservative revolution", a right-wing intellectual phenomenon of German history during the Weimar Republic, has become the main subject of O.E. Terekhov scientific researches. It should be noted, that over time the scientific interests of Kemerovo historians-germanists have affected the problems of world history, which is reflected in the works of S.V. Arapina, A.V. Ravnushkin, E.A. Zharonkina, A.E. Antonov devoted to various political, economic and social aspects of Germany history of the XX - early XXI centuries.
   A West Siberian Centre of German Studies, created in 1999 on the initiative of Y.V. Galaktionov and B. Bonvech, played significant role in the development of German history studies at Kemerovo State University and West Siberian region: under his auspices two collective manuals of Germany history and ten collections from the series "German Studies in Siberia" were published, a number of international scientific conferences were held. Thus, both the individual and collective work of Kemerovo historians made a definite contribution to the development of modern Russian historical germanistics.

ID MULTIPOLARITY
AB The article addresses the issue of historical context of the Russian foreign policy and its practical implications. The author points out that the current political developments within the international system cannot be understood properly without assessing the historical trajectory of the Russian identity. The article divided into three parts that demonstrate the importance of the contextual approach to the Russian foreign policy. The first part deals with the changes in international power balance and the need to conceptualize the new normal without suppressing opposing narratives. The second part assess the practical consideration of such a conceptualization with the aim of mitigating the current tensions between the Russian Federation and the Western states. The third part presents an overview of the Russian approach towards tong-term international stability, distributional international justice and mutual respect.
   The author concludes that profound change in the international system did not bring considerable alteration in the Russian strategic culture and strategic vision. The article also reassesses the widespread idea of colonialism as the core elements of the Russian strategic thinking. The historical context of the Russian foreign policy proves the opposite view that the vision of self in Russia is much more about bridging the gaps and facilitating mutual dialog. Moreover, the author believes that the main reason for that approach is the relatively stable international position of Russia (in terms of centuries, rather than decades).

AB In the article the tendencies of the development of the consumer market of the Russian regions are studied. The study covers the periods of the economic growth since 2010 till 2013 and the introduction of the economic sanctions and the imposition of the counter-sanctions in 2014-2015. For the research the method of the cluster analysis is used, the results of which showed that in Russia five groups (virtual clusters) of regions are isolated according to the criteria characterizing the parameters of the consumer market suggested by the authors. The changes in the macroeconomic and political conditions lead to considerable transformations of the consumer market of the suggested groups of Russian regions according to the level of its development and its structure. The regions-leaders keep their dominating position at any changes of the economic and political competitive position. The regions-outsiders under favourable conditions move closer to the leading group. In contrast during the worsening of the economic conditions the group of the outsiders is widened due to the regions of an average development level. The character of the structural changes of the consumer market depends considerably on the classification group to which the region belongs.

DE Corruption; authority and business; civil society; expert institutes
AB The problems of counteraction to the corruption in the Russian Federation are analysed. The authors chose the attitude of the authority to the society as an object of the research. The authors undertook the attempt to not only show the negative effect of corruption illegal actions, but also to determine the main direction of counteraction, including by means of expert institutions and other forms of influence of civil society on the processes of minimisation of the corruption in Russia. Activation of the struggle with corruption is determined by actualisation of the most important functions of expert institutes. These functions include provision of open, reliable information for government agencies; assistance in the early diagnostics and assessment of possible consequences of the made decisions; giving opportunity to the government bodies to extend the information and organisation base of solutions; reaching publicity and other groups of interests or, on their behalf, the government bodies. Besides, there is mediation between citizens and government institutions; involvement of citizens, public organisations in participation in specific political, socio-economic urgent questions; consolidation of the public order; legitimation of political, socio-economic solutions. In addition, they can include attaching legitimacy to state-social life and activity of government bodies; provision of the channel of interaction between "citizens and social structures", "science and state", "business structures and government bodies", expression of public differentiation, the formal lobbying of objectively existing groups of interests on the government bodies and many others. These and other aspects of the problem have been reflected in this paper. (c) 2018 Published by Future Academy www.FutureAcademy.org.UK

AB The Russian revolution is a process of ambiguous modernization (since the end of the 19th century), which is still not institutionally completed. The key moment was the events of 2017. Their result was the coming to power of the Bolshevik Party, the Civil War, the formation of the political regime, which gave the very traumatic modernization form for socium. To explain these events, we propose a P. Chaadayev paradox about the prospect of the victory of historically untenable socialism because of the untenable of its opponents. The "Chaadayev factor" content clarified with the help of the concepts of political will and N. Taleb's "black swans". From this point of view, the society transition into a new state is a matter of a small number of uncompromising people, who are personally interested in the transition, involved in this process. Success comes in the case of simplification of problems and solutions in combination with the accentuated uncompromising minority and sufficient tolerance of the majority, when representatives of this majority have an asymmetry in their choice. The review results are beyond the scope of Russian experience and open up new opportunities for analyzing and solving problems of passionarity and tolerance. For example, if the reciprocity in tolerance conditions will violated, the society may lose immunity in relation to the willful intolerant minority.

DE civil society; civil participation; social forecasting; expert

AB Civil society plays an increasingly important role in the economic and social development around the world. The article attempts to identify the conditions for the functioning of the civil society in Russia and forecast its development in the near future. The empirical framework of the research lies in the results of an expert survey held by the Russian Academy of Sciences in February-March, 2018. The research methods are based on two principles: first, the forecasting process is based on the procedure of expert evaluation of the current conditions, probability, and preference of possible changes in the civil society. Second, analysis is carried out as a result of integration of assessments of experts representing various socio-political spheres (government, business, third sector, science, the media). The research reveals that expert opinions on all aspects of functioning of the civil society are highly differentiated, which, on the one hand, can be explained by different ideological views of the expert community, on the other - indicates the current extremely uncertain and contradictory state of the sphere under study and its prospects. Based on the expert method the image of the Russian civil society taking into account the social context of its functioning and development prospects in the next five years has been formed. It is concluded that the current and probable situations, as well as the conditions for achieving the preferred situation in the civil sphere are largely determined by the high level of state influence. However, experts attribute the preferred changes in the state of the civil society in the country to the growing population's constructive self-organization. Therefore, the experts' ideas about the probable and desirable areas of development of the civil society do not coincide. It is proved that partnership development of the civil society characterized by a high level of civil participation and significant state support is the most promising for Russia. The results may be of interest to specialists conducting research on the problem of the civil society and the representatives of public administration and civil society.

AB Russian statehood is characterized by its longstanding historical existence and sustainable historical continuity, even though there were fundamental changes in the forms of government. Of great importance for preserving Russia's historical steadiness has been the political and cultural tradition connecting generations and epochs. One of its constants is the image of Rome, which is primarily identified with the universal experience of world power and civilization. This article studies the evolution of this image throughout the entire history of Russia-from the Old Russian state to the present time. The sign system of the Russian political and cultural tradition did not tie Rome to a particular location; it could semantically be transferred to other strong centers of power and transposed in time and space. The integral definition of the "Rome" concept also included a certain religious component and was supplemented with cultural value elements. The image of Rome was experienced aesthetically and imparted in the form of art, and it contained a political sentiment which was not always clearly defined. At times "different Romes" could consolidate to produce a complex figurative construct. Transforming along with the political and cultural tradition, Rome was one of the constants essential to the self-identification of the Russian civilization.

DE Civil War in Russia; history of leisure; deviant leisure; alcohol;

AB This article considers the history of leisure during the Civil War in Russia. The author analyses the significance of the Soviet literature of the 1920s as a historical source for the study of everyday life. The author relies on methodological approaches of leisure history as a part of Alltagsgeschichte and makes a historiographical review a number of everyday life issues, i.e. the living conditions; changes in the chronotope of post-revolutionary leisure; studying of violence, different excesses, etc. The analysis of changes in the field of leisure is based on works of fiction of some contemporaries and participants of the Civil War (A. Marienhof, A. Tolstoy, N. Lyashko, etc.). The author formulates an essential condition for the effective use of literary texts in historical research which means studying them in a broader historiographical and social context. The paper examines various factors underlying the spreading of deviant leisure practices (drug abuse, gambling, etc.) in the period of the Civil War, the impact of the post-revolutionary socio-political transformation on the everyday lives of citizens. The overall radicalisation during the Revolution and the Civil War profoundly changed people's behaviour patterns and, among others, their leisure models. The fragility of existence, the disintegration of "strong ties" (in families and at work) contributed to the spreading of deviant leisure activities. However, there was no qualitative shift in traditional leisure culture. At the same time, it is possible to observe a reallocation of time among different types of antisocial behavior, a reduced number of resources and changing urban topography of deviant leisure between 1918 and 1922.

AB Introduction - socio-political and socio-economic changes in society largely define a developing personality. Goal - to conduct a psychodiagnostic evaluation of the changes in basic personal characteristics of young students in the context of Russian society development. Results: the comparison of two groups of medical student (both groups arc identical: the second course, the department of general medicine, Yaroslavl State Medical University). Testing of 1992 (n = 243) and 2016 (n = 197) using the 16-PF Questionnaire and the POI reveals two main tendencies. The first tendency is the increase of the general level of tension (the 16-PF scales: C, I. O, Q4 - all the quantitative indices have increased, p <0.01, Student's (-test). The second tendency is a significant growth of the efficiency of personal characteristics providing self-regulation and voluntary behaviour (the 16PF scales: E, G, H, Q3 are analogous to the first tendency: the SAV scale of the POI also reports a growth with high statistical values). Discussion: the respondents from the first group were born in 1972-1973. Prenatal maturation, babyhood, junior school. and early adolescent age took place in the epoch of a high degree of stability and succession in the development of society. The respondents from the second group were born in 1998-1999. The samples are separated by a generation. The second group (2016 testing) reports a high level of neuro-psychic tension during socio-psychological adaptation and, consequently, the growth of efforts in developing voluntary regulation of social behavior. Evidently, there is value of self-actualization in the new reality.

DE methods of teaching languages; teaching vocabulary; the Arabic language;
   literary language; typological features of the language; root of an
   Arabic word
AB In the era of globalization, mankind faces the problem of mutual understanding among peoples. In the process of communication, in order to understand foreigners' speech and to express their own thoughts, people need to have quite a high level of intelligence and a large vocabulary. Certainly, this refers to the professional communication in a foreign language, rather than to everyday communication. It is graduates of higher educational institutions who should obtain such a high qualification.
   Thus, the main purpose of working on the vocabulary in the process of training is to form lexical skills. However, the methods of forming students' lexical skills are different and they directly depend on the specific lexical and grammatical character of the target language.
   Mastering the vocabulary of the Arabic language involves considerable difficulties. The main difficulty is the large amount of the Arabic thesaurus, which is due to certain historical, political and sociocultural reasons. The current linguistic situation in the Arab countries is characterized by the coexistence, functional-stylistic differentiation and interaction of several linguistic forms.
   It is the Literary Arabic language which serves as the official language of the Arab world and the state language of the Arab countries. Interethnic communication of the peoples of the Middle East and North-East Africa is carried out by means of regional everyday conversational koines. The Arabic literary language, common to all Arab countries, is opposed by the Arabic dialect system, which includes the most characteristic features of all local dialects.
   All the above-mentioned factors make a teacher carefully select lexical units in the minimum vocabulary. Thus, at the initial stage of training, it should mostly include the common lexis. The preference is given to the frequency stylistically neutral words with extensive compatibility, whereas the words related to dialectisms, jargonisms, professionalisms, are included in the lexical minimum at the advanced stage of training.
   The authors come to the conclusion that the greatest difficulty among students is caused by distinguishing the root of an Arabic word. It is due to the typological features of the Arabic language. Given this, at the initial stage of training it is necessary to draw students' attention to the difference of the structure of an Arabic word (of Semitic origin) from the Indo-European one: an Arabic root is a lexical abstraction expressed by three constant consonants. The root is preserved semantically and phonetically both in inflection and in word-formation, which allows, on the one hand, distinguishing it as a common element in a number of cognate words, and, on the other hand, separating those stemforming (inflectional and derivational) affixes which bring grammatical meanings and are conventional for the formation of certain grammatical categories.
   The conclusions drawn in the paper are of great practical importance. The earlier students studying Arabic learn to distinguish the root and the stem-forming element in a word, the sooner an Arabic word will become clearer for them and the less time it will take them to look up that word in the dictionary and to memorize it.

AB During last three decades political history is proving to be a fully pertinent field of the French historical science. After a long period of profound discredit French political history has managed to enrich its methodology with resources of the adjacent disciplines, transcended its traditional boundaries of state institutions and public law and developed research technics for wide temporal scales. Thus French political history shows basic capacities for so-called historical synthesis, highly in demand in France after decline of the classic social history. This paper is dedicated to the analysis of causes for the recent rise of the political history in France. This paper is concentrated on the proper theoretical work of political historians promoting their own field, rather than on any explanation deriving from a diagnosis of the tendencies on the level of the whole historical discipline. In particular, this paper shows crucial importance of a certain manner of political historians to define the field of research of political history.

AB The emergence of international law and periodization of its development remain relevant today. In general, most scientists consider that there were limited manifestations of international law in the era of Antiquity and the European Middle Ages. However, the manifestations that did emerge are significant. In particular, the practice of settling interstate agreements in the Ancient East evidences such importance. In the context of ancient civilization, this practice reached a new level. It led to the emergence of sufficiently broad alliances of states and at the same time, customary international law, as was observed in the international legal practices in the times of Hellenistic era and the era of the Roman Empire.

The reasons are insufficient financial independence and shortage of skills. Asian think tanks are often preoccupied with research for corporations and government agencies that provide their funding. It negatively affects the ability of the think tanks to independently set the research agenda and express critical viewpoint. However, think tanks often provide valuable platforms for dialogue among experts that can be helpful during periods of deterioration of the political relations between countries. For instance, the role of Japanese and Russian think tanks as "track two" diplomacy actors was helpful particularly during the period of deterioration of Russia-Japan relations in 2014-2015. The article also looks at the development of the Asian think tank networks. Most of these networks were created in support of regional frameworks such as APEC, ASEAN Plus Three, ARF, etc. Asian think tank networks depend on a number of "core institutions" that regularly host events and ensure continuity of the agenda. The article then draws conclusions on the potential of Russia's influence on ideological and political processes in the Asia-Pacific region.

AB In this article, the main groups of dialectal onomastic vocabulary are considered in the historical and linguacultural perspective. The main findings of the study include: dialect vocabulary is a repository of Old Russian and Proto-Slavic archaisms. Nicknames reflect the ancient naming system of Russians, along with innovative nominative motives. The basis of the dialectal onomastic vocabulary is microtoponymic and microanthroponymic formations. Precedential names have a special place in this series. Dialectal onomastics and dialectal phraseology are inexhaustible and renewable with the passage of time sources of linguistics and cultural information.

AB Rapid advances in information technology and proliferation of social media services have caused a radical transformation of human communication. Having created a social media presence people engage in computer-mediated communication, set their own goals as well as perfect their knowledge of English as a global language. The richness and diversity of computer-mediated discourse is concentrated in multiple online experiences and therefore enables to study a great number of linguistic changes. Various studies of computer-mediated discourse analyze socio-psychological characteristics in coherent sequences of sentences, propositions, speech or turns-at-talk. The given article aims at presenting vocabulary teaching strategies to new computer-mediated language and their influence on students' acquisition. Our contribution provides an overview of the recent new entries of computer-mediated vocabulary in online crowdsourced dictionaries. The main ways of forming new words as well as wide-spread semantic changes are viewed (acronyms, compounds, suffixes, blended words, conversion, etc.) Computer-mediated vocabulary teaching in the classroom covers change, diversity, disputes in economical, political, social spheres (such as narcissistic tendencies, emotional correctness, excessive use of social media and increasing reliance on technology, equal rights movement, task-based employment, etc). As the social media universe strives for a thorough integration with the user's life language learners are expected to embrace the latest changes in linguistic norms and devise an appropriate philosophy of language management.

AB The article considers the concept of sustainable development, presents the evolution of the concept of sustainable development, reveals the factors that affect the sustainable development of economic entities. The authors emphasize that sustainable development can be considered in relation to the economy of the country as a whole, the economy of a particular region, the economy of the enterprise. A special role is given to the study of sustainable development of the region. According to the authors, the concept of sustainable development has passed a long evolutionary path and can be divided into three stages: initial, political, stage of socio-economic problems. At the present stage, the concept of "sustainable development" in our country is relevant and the role of the regions in ensuring its sustainable development is constantly increasing. This requires new approaches in the definition of economic regional policy, the development of new forms and methods of sustainable management of socio-economic development of the region. At the same time, the objectives of economic and social development must be defined in terms of its sustainability and environmental imperatives, and extend not only to the macro but also to the micro level.

DE educational principles; slang; media text; slang layer; translating
   transformations; the adequacy of translation
AB The paper presents some of the relevant principles of language education in Russia where there is a need to transfer the learning of English slang and vernacular language into the Russian language together with achieving an adequate simultaneous translation. Language learning is analysed here with the aim to demonstrate that media text slang translation is a valid method for language practice and improvement. The objectives of the research are to show the translation activities which reinforce students' awareness of language use and, to study the translation efficiency in learning English.
   A general scientific methodological basis of research is based on the educational principles of consistency, anthropocentrism and determinism. The principle of anthropocentrism determines the human factor in the teaching of language as important, which describes the specifics of slang units. The principle of consistency makes this approach essential to the description of slang, in which it appears as a separate layer of vocabulary within the language system. The methods of the study are 1) an overview of the theoretical background, with a re-analysis of the main empirical research on the effects of translation in the classroom, and attitudes toward translation, 2) questionnaire surveys of learning practices and perceived benefits, 3) analysis of translation activities in the language classroom.
   The results of the experiment indicated that slang from the English language media texts has a well-established pronunciation, and writing is used to describe new phenomena in the day-to-day political, economic and social life. However, the majority of slang is at the stage of entering the Russian language and sometimes is used as terms. One of the effective tools of this approach is the use of media texts for foreign language studies with the aim of developing a critical understanding of the slang words and their usage.
   On the basis of these studies the conclusion was made that the English slang is a valid pedagogical tool in the foreign language learning processes that can help students develop and improve competences and skills such as vocabulary, speaking, reading, writing skills, and grammar.

DT Article
DE religiosity; Karsavin; Kudryavtsev; Bitsilli; Guerrier; Middle Ages
AB The article is devoted to a number of Russian studies regarding the medieval religiosity of the individual. As a rule, the development of this direction is associated with the Annales school, which in the 20th century had a serious influence on various historical research aspects not only in Europe. In the framework of this article, the attention is focused on the research work of Guerrier, Karsavin, Kudryavtsev, and Bitsilli. In the national historical scholarship at the time, the term "mentality" was absent. However, such concepts as "consciousness", "religiosity" were repeatedly used. The researchers sought to explain not only the formation and significance of this phenomenon in the context of social history, but also paid attention to its cultural specificity, in particular, referring to the symbolism of the medieval individual's thinking. Some of the Russian historians of medieval European history the late 19th - first decade of the 20th century made a significant contribution to the work on the subject. The interest in the man in history emerged in Russian medieval studies of the time. It is important to note that in analyzing the religiousness of an individual, Russian scholars focused on the views of certain outstanding personalities: as a rule, those of the elite, the chroniclers and the theologians. Further development of research in this direction was interrupted by political events and the later formation of a new historical pattern. Russian scholarship addressed this problem again only in the 1980s.

AB Nowadays philosophers and scientists raise the question of whether there are limits to the sociality of all the knowledge received and analyzed by humans, and offer different strategies for contemplating reality. This is also a subject of reflection for those who are engaged in intellectual history, because the purpose of such research is to solve the question of how to preserve knowledge about yourself and about the world among the many socially constructed pseudo-realities. This article analyzes the phenomenon of "social turn" in the philosophy of science, in particular, the question of whether modem science is a completely social product, given that social norms in the conditions of the highest degree of infomiatization and communication have become mobile and actively reviewed and transformed, and political decisions have at times a decisive influence on the development of individual branches of science, and ultimately, on science as a system of objective knowledge.

The causes which led to the change in the policy of the Soviet government against the religious organizations are identified, the analysis of the activities of the Soviet state on creating a new system of state-church relations, the main stages of its development are represented.
   The activity of the newly created authorities on "Religious Affairs" - the Council for Russian Orthodox Church and the Religious Affairs Council is revealed. The authors show a response to the change in the state-church relations in the center and different strata of Soviet society and also the ratio of official policy and propaganda with a specific embodiment of the state church policy.
   M.I. Odintsov and A.S. Kochetova analyze the situation and activity of religious organizations in the occupied territories of the USSR. The plans and main directions of the Nazi policy towards religion and religious organizations in the occupied territories of the USSR, directives of the political and military leadership of Nazi Germany are studied. The authors compare the religious policies of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union and show their similarities and differences, emphasizing that the last ones were most clearly expressed from the beginning of the Great Patriotic War.
   The book features a wide source base. The documentation of 6 major Russian archives was used for solving the research problem.

TI AT HOME AMONG STRANGERS, A STRANGER AT HOME. CULTURAL CONSERVATISM OF
   T.S. ELIOT
SO VESTNIK PERMSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-ISTORIYA-PERM UNIVERSITY HERALD-HISTORY
LA Russian
DT Article
DE T.S. Eliot; cultural conservatism; supra-political; values of European
   culture; political reputation of a writer
AB The article considers changes in the political reputation of the outstanding modernist poet T.S. Eliot, whose socio-political ideas elude the one-dimensional characteristics. Attention is paid to Eliot's views on culture, which are traditionally attributed to the conservative political spectrum and give basis to blame him in anti-Semitism or even in pro-fascist mentality. The author argues that Eliot's political views have for the most part never been specially articulated and systematized into political concepts or manifesto. His support for the French conservative writer and activist Maurras was broadly in line with the strategy of the magazine "Criterion" edited by T.S. Eliot: it consisted in acquaintance of the public with the widest possible range of aesthetic phenomena and personalities of modern culture. The poet's views on the imperfection of human nature, the moral foundation of social and political action, the apologia of the European Christian culture correlated with the core of traditionalist cultural conservatism. The convergence of aesthetic modernism with right-wing and left-wing political radicalism is a key characteristic of the interwar period and can be traced in many cultural phenomena. However, the priorities of T.S. Eliot have not been associated with either socialist or fascist projects, in which the refined poet have seen the worst manifestation of the "uprising of the masses". The mass popularity of his complicated texts in contemporary mass culture, show business and film industry represents a paradoxical turn in the public interpretation of his heritage. Nowadays, public perception of his rhetoric is becoming more balanced and sometimes his ideas are defined as supra-political. The crisis of traditional "big" parties and ideologies and the flowering of new forms of political activity give the possibility to find in T.S. Eliot's mistrust to Western political institutions capability to foresee trends in Western European culture and society.

   parties; Comintern; social democracy; communist movement; the Bolsheviks
AB The Bolshevik policy toward Germany, the relationship between the Communist Party of Soviet Russia and the German Social Democracy, which came to power as a result of the First World War is analyzed in the article. The issue of the geopolitical interests and ideological orientations of the Bolshevik leadership and the German socialists is considered, and disagreements between various currents in Marxism on internal and foreign policy issues are examined. The problem of the dualism of the policy of the CPSU (b) in the first years of power, the contradiction between the theoretical attitudes to the "world revolution" and the practical need of the Soviet state for carrying out a "policy of peaceful coexistence" is raised, and the strategy and tactics of the Bolsheviks are analyzed at a time when their government turned out the emerging Versailles system of international relations. The activity of the Communist International on the expansion of political influence in the world and the search for allies for Soviet Russia are traced. The topicality of the problem under investigation is conditioned by the need to develop long-standing historical ties between the Russian and German states, to study the mechanisms for establishing good-neighborly relations and the desirability of improving them at the present stage. The author concludes that, despite theoretical differences, the national interests of Germany and Russia forced both Marxist parties to converge, which ultimately contributed to the conclusion of the Rapallo Treaty and the transition to political and economic cooperation between the two countries.

AB The purpose of this article is to formulate a comprehensive view of the legal regulation of relations between people of the same sex and an attempt to develop a common worldview, which has been formed in the scientific doctrine. The Russian doctrine ambiguously approaches the perception of relations of people of the same sex as a phenomenon that is naturally developed in the world community and its emergence and formation in Russia. A special conceptual apparatus used in the scientific research is subject to analysis. Graduation of scientific presentations is made in five groups: conservatives, liberals, extreme liberals, radicals and extreme radicals. Attention is drawn to the key factors affecting Russian science: political, social, religious. The authors' arguments on all groups are generalized and systematized. The sociological data of Russia and the USA are subject to research The authors come to the conclusion that ideologically, Russia is characterized by heteronormativity, that is, a worldview in which heterosexuality is understood as a social norm of sexual behavior of any person. Theoretical propositions and conclusions formulated by the authors can be useful for pedagogical purposes, popularization in the mass media, in the legislative, law enforcement practice and educational process.

TI CONCEPTUALIZATION OF THE CENTER AND CENTRALITY IN THE THEORY OF
   FEDERALISM
SO POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY
   OF POLITICS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE federalism; center; centrality; polity; political form
AB The main purpose of this paper is to construct a new conception of federalism by reinterpreting the logical-theoretical relationship between the categories of the federal center, the subjects of the federation and the federal whole. In the author's opinion, the task of comprehending the factual material, despite the importance of this procedure, is of secondary importance in comparison to the task of identifying a common plan, or scheme, hidden in the existing empirical foundation. The author starts with discussing the phenomenon of the federal center, which becomes the logical and theoretical point of intersection of all basic categories of the theory of federalism. On the basis of the phenomenological analysis of the center as a general category, the author formulates a non-trivial justification why it is necessary to distinguish between the center and centrality as an ontological content of the system, which allows the author to rethink the relationship between the real political centers and centers of social unification. The author concludes that the federal political unity represents an integral expression of a united (political, social) center, which dialectically reflects the unity of the federation itself. Therefore, the fundamental problem of the theory of federalism consists not so much in answering the question "who is more important?", but rather in searching for a way of describing the special unity of the political center of the federation, which manifests itself in the federal center and the political centers of the subjects of the federation, while preserving an arbitrarily wide variety of elements of a federation.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE religion; the ultimate foundations; intention; super-valued; sacred
   image
AB The article presents the main ideas of the concept, according to which religion in its genesis and development is rooted in the basic, existential human intentions. Such intentions are a synthesis of psychophysiological and socio-cultural motivations. Basic intentions are formed during the long period of phylogenesis of mankind and are necessarily present in ontogenesis of each individual. These intentions are the ultimate foundations of religion. Throughout the history of religion, they act as a constant factor of paramount importance, the constants of the existence of religion. In addition to ultimate foundations on the existence of religion affect historically volatile, situational factors. They determine historical, ethno-cultural and confessional variability of religion. In contrast to situational factors the ultimate foundations exist as universals of human existence. As such, they substantiate not only a religion. Religion is one of the spiritual formations that arise as a way of mastering the ultimate foundations of human existence and exist as a way of regulating relations with them. Basic intentions are represented in consciousness as the highest meanings and the most important life orientations. Higher meanings and orientations receive the status of sacred objects and super-values in religious mentality. Each religion constructs images of sacred objects and hierarchy of super-values according to historical, ethno-cultural, socio-political conditions of its existence, but in its ultimate foundations all religions are united. The ultimate foundations of religion determine the fundamental unity of religion as a spiritual formation.

TI German Policy through the Lens of Russian Mainstream Thinking
SO GERMAN POLITICS
LA English
DT Article
AB The article explores the way in which German policies are portrayed in the Russian mainstream narrative. It concentrates on the 'real sovereignty' theory, which seems to have captured the mainstream thinking of world politics in Russia. Three aspects of this theory are discussed: first, whether it withstands the test of the Ukraine crisis; second, whether it can provide the Russian political establishment with an appropriate explanation of the current state of relations with Germany, at its lowest since reunification; and finally, if it gives the Russian political establishment a pretext to believe that the strategic partnership is not terminated but only temporarily suspended. The mainstream Russian narrative provides grounds for Moscow to believe that a strategic partnership with Germany is still feasible. However, the underlying purposes of such a partnership, as seen in Berlin and Moscow, are rather different and can hardly be reconciled.

ID EUROPEAN INTEGRATION; JUDGMENTS
AB Evaluation based on expert surveys is widespread in comparative research. However, the reliability and validity of the results obtained from such surveys may depend on 1) the politicization of the subject of study (i.e. the problem of sensitivity), 2) the current political regime (Russia is characterized by experts as 'electoral authoritarianism') and 3) the ongoing process of the professionalization of the expert community. The authors suggest that all three systematically affect the quality of expertise and are the sources of specific biases which must be recognized when dealing with expert surveys in appropriate contexts. Empirically this study draws on the expert surveys conducted within the framework of the international Electoral Integrity Project. The authors find that the spread of expert opinions depends on the experts' ideological preferences, their confidence in the existing political institutions, individual voting strategy (ruling party vs. opposition), and the degree of confidence in television. On a more general level, the article provides a description of the state of the modern Russian expert community in the field of electoral expertise.

DE higher education; small and medium-sized cities; Ural Federal District;
   macro-region; system of education
ID UNIVERSITY; TOWN
AB In the crisis of modern Russian society, higher education (HE) performs a number of new functions. One of them is to save small and medium-sized cities due to the presence of universities in them. The article deals with the problem of maintaining HE in such cities. The keenness of the problem is determined by at least two factors. The first factor is the reform of the education system, which lead to the decline in the quality of education at all levels of the educational system in the peripheral regions and small and medium-sized cities of the country. The second factor is reduction of the means of financing, referring to education in Russia in general, and HE, in particular. This leads to the closure of universities in small and medium-sized cities or to their transformation into branches of universities located in large cities. Both of these factors destroy education in small and medium-sized cities of Russia.
   The consequence of such processes is the polarization of the educational space in Russia, with a relatively high quality of education in large cities being preserved, and significant deterioration of education in small and medium-sized cities taking place. This situation initiates the migration of active working-age population from small and medium-sized cities, the outflow of positive human capital, especially for young people, and entails the gradual "dying" of middle towns with the tendency to become "cities of the elderly" (with an aging population), ghost cities.
   The article is based on the sociological survey of HE in the UFD (Ural Federal District), one of the major macro-regions of Russia. The cases of several small and medium-sized cities of the district were studied, in which the problem outlined in the article became obvious. Case studies included the analysis of demographic statistics, education statistics, interviews with university students and teachers, parents, content analysis of Internet sites and forums. Such methods of research as expert interviews and mass surveys of students and teachers of Ural universities were also used.
   The purpose of the study is to research the objective prerequisites and subjective assessments of the current crisis situation in the HE of the district.
   The object of the study was the system of education in small and medium-sized cities of the UFD. The subject of the study is the relationship between the destruction of the education system and the socioeconomic, demographic and socio-cultural crisis in small and medium-sized cities of the UFD.
   The solution of the problem of preserving universities in middle and medium-sized cities depends to a large extent on the political and economic macro-factors present in the country and the macro-region. The practical significance of the study is to research the extent of the current crisis situation in the HE of the UFD and the prospects for overcoming it, as well as in informing the necessary administrative decisions.

AB Objectives: The article is aimed at understanding the peculiarities of the Soviet historical novel "Old England" by E.L. Lann, in particular, the unique images of the famous English writers Jonathan Swift, Joseph Addison and Alexander Pope. Methods: The article is methodologically based on research in the field of textology and poetics of the historical novel, of problems of intercultural communication, dialogue and "someone else's word", and semiotics. In the process of analysis, cultural-historical, comparative-historical, historical-typological, historical-genetic approaches, as well as methods of problematic, comparative analysis of artistic works were used. Findings: The novel by E.L. Lann "Old England" recreates the social, cultural and literary life of England in the first half of the 18th century, in the time of opposition between Whigs and Tories, and contains vivid portraits of leading writers. In the foreground there is the figure of Jonathan Swift, who was worried about the fate of literature because it was losing the educative value and stopping to guide readers to higher ideals, accentuating the inferior principles of being. E.L. Lann shows the political parties in power, or aspiring to it, using the talents of many writers in their own interests due to the venality of the latter. Novelty: "Old England" is written in the traditions of the Soviet novel, but it has a number of features, that was stipulated by the unusual nature of the characters and by the special way of discovering characteristics of heroes.

DE Kabardino-Cherkess language; socio-political vocabulary; borrowing;
   spelling; discord; reform
AB The article deals with some issues of spelling in the Kabardino-Cherkess language of socially-political words borrowed from the Russian language or through the Russian language. It is noted that over the past decades the vocabulary of the Kabardino-Cherkess language have a lot, a large number of borrowed words, especially of socio-political meaning, appeared. It is shown that the main source of development and enrichment of sociopolitical vocabulary of the Kabardino-Cherkess language is the Russian language. The relevance of the study lies in the fact that with such a large number of borrowings in the modern Kabardino-Cherkess language there is no uniformity in the writing of socio-political lexemes. The author analyzes the main disadvantages of the current rules of spelling. The novelty of the research is seen in the fact that the author suggests specific ways to overcome spelling instability in spelling of borrowed socio-political words. It is concluded that the current "Rules of spelling and punctuation of the Kabardino-Cherkess language" need to be reformed, it is necessary to develop scientific principles of spelling of borrowings in the Kabardino-Cherkess language. To solve this problem, it is proposed to establish a linguistic and terminological Commission in the Republic at the government level.

The authors conclude that the implementation of this plan led to the stabilization of the sociopolitical situation in Western Europe, to the undermining of Soviet influence in Eastern Europe, to the beginning of European economic integration, and to a sharp increase in the political and economic positions of the United States in Europe.

AB The reviewed work is devoted to a significant, and yet little-studied in both national and foreign scholarship, issue of the clergy interactions with the German occupational authorities on the territory of the USSR in the days of the Great Patriotic War. It introduces into scientific use a historically significant complex of documents (1941-1945) from the archive of the Office of the Metropolitan Sergius (Voskresensky) of Vilnius and Lithuania, patriarchal exarch in Latvia and Estonia, as well as records from the investigatory records on charges against clergy and employees concerned in the activities of the Pskov Orthodox Mission (1944-1990). Documents included in the publication are stored in the archives of Moscow, St. Petersburg, Estonia, Lithuania, the Leningrad, Novgorod, and Pskov regions. They allow some insight into nature, forms, and methods of the Nazi occupational regime policies in the conquered territories (including policies towards the Church). The documents capture religious policies of the Nazis and inner life of the exarchate, describe actual situation of population and clergy, management activities and counterinsurgency on the occupied territories. The documents bring to light connections between the exarchate and German counterintelligence and reveal the nature of political police work with informants. They capture the political mood of the population and the prisoners of war. There is information on participants of partisan movement and underground resistance, on communication net between the patriarchal exarchate in the Baltic states and the German counterintelligence. Reports and dispatches of the clergy in the pay of the Nazis addressed to Metropolitan Sergius (Voskresensky) contain detailed activity reports. Investigatory records contain important biographical information and personal data on the collaborators. Most of the documents, being classified, have never been published before.

DT Article
DE political parties; party policy positions left-right scale;
   social-democrats; the new left; ecological parties; immigrants
ID POLICY SHIFTS; NICHE; OWNERSHIP; GREEN
AB In this article, we study factors defining left party's policy positions on the immigration issue. This theme is not so popular in political science despite of plenty of works devoted to that problem in the context of far-right and mainstream parties. Therefore in this paper, we propose our own models that takes into account two kinds of factors: endogenous (organizational) traits and exogenous (enviromental) arrangement. Proposed models try to explain the position and saliency of immigration issue in the manifestos of social-democratic, green and new left parties. We pay more attention on several independent variables, such as electoral competition (we operationalize it through the notion of effective number of parties offered by Laakso and Taagepera), migration rate, popularity of far-right party, party's nicheness, organizational traits (that we consider in terms of leaders-activists relations). We have two dependent variables which called (1) party position on the immigration issue and (2) saliency of this issue. In order to estimate necessary links between variables we use regression analysis of time-series-cross-section data. As units of our research we present political party's moves in 10 Western European countries between 1975 and 2010. We conclude that organizational peculiarities with its link to the electoral competition make influence to the dependent variable. Niche parties tend not to concentrate their attention on the issue of immigration, but if they do that greens and new lefts demonstrate pro-immigrant positions. Social-democrats try to act less forthrightly in order to maximize their electoral support.

AB The growing macroeconomic and political tensions between Russia and the Baltic States since the latter entered into the European Union have emphasized an urgency in establishing reciprocal relationships, based on common ground and mutual interests, to relieve the consequences of sanctions and restrictive policies. The article is aimed at highlighting the distinctions in the public administration framework in Russia and Baltic countries. Thus, the political power from forming a system of public administration can leverage influence on the social and economic relations in conditions of legitimacy and participation of civil society arrangements. The article involves comparative evaluation of Russian and Baltic model of public administration as well as deep comparison of public-private partnership (PPP) and state procurement models in Russia and abroad. Authors highlighted pros and cons of both Russian and foreign frameworks, resulting in "cooperation-prosperity" course.

Influencing these factors by means of sound state policy can initiate economic growth on an innovative basis. An assessment of existing institutional barriers that act as constraints to economic growth in Russia is provided in the paper. In addition, the role of institutional design in optimizing the state policy for stimulating accelerated development and structural reorganization of the main development institutions is defined and an algorithm for implementing institutional design and its direction is proposed.
