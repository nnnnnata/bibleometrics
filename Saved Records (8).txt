AB How do the Internet and social media affect political outcomes? We review empirical evidence from the recent political economy literature, focusing primarily on work that considers traits that distinguish the Internet and social media from traditional off-line media, such as low barriers to entry and reliance on user-generated content. We discuss the main results about the effects of the Internet in general, and social media in particular, on voting, street protests, attitudes toward government, political polarization, xenophobia, and politicians' behavior. We also review evidence on the role of social media in the dissemination of fake news, and we summarize results about the strategies employed by autocratic regimes to censor the Internet and to use social media for surveillance and propaganda. We conclude by highlighting open questions about how the Internet and social media shape politics in democracies and autocracies.

AB Do new communication technologies, such as social media, alleviate the collective action problem? This paper provides evidence that penetration of VK, the dominant Russian online social network, led to more protest activity during a wave of protests in Russia in 2011. As a source of exogenous variation in network penetration, we use the information on the city of origin of the students who studied with the founder of VK, controlling for the city of origin of the students who studied at the same university several years earlier or later. We find that a 10% increase in VK penetration increased the probability of a protest by 4.6% and the number of protesters by 19%. Additional results suggest that social media induced protest activity by reducing the costs of coordination rather than by spreading information critical of the government. We observe that VK penetration increased pro-governmental support, with no evidence of increased polarization. We also find that cities with higher fractionalization of network users between VK and Facebook experienced fewer protests, and the effect of VK on protests exhibits threshold behavior.

TI Constraining Governments: New Indices of Vertical, Horizontal, and
   Diagonal Accountability
SO AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID CIVIL-SOCIETY; GOVERNANCE; DEMOCRACY
AB Accountability-constraints on a government's use of political power-is one of the cornerstones of good governance. However, conceptual stretching and a lack of reliable measures have limited cross-national research on this concept. To address this research gap, we use V-Dem data and innovative Bayesian methods to develop new indices of accountability and its subtypes: the extent to which governments are accountable to citizens (vertical accountability), other state institutions (horizontal accountability), and the media and civil society (diagonal accountability). In this article, we describe the conceptual and empirical framework underlying these indices and demonstrate their content, convergent, and construct validity. The resulting indices have unprecedented coverage (1900-present) and offer researchers and policymakers new opportunities to investigate the causes and consequences of accountability and its disaggregated subtypes. Furthermore, the methodology provides a framework for theoretically driven index construction to scholars working with cross-national panel data.

AB This paper problematizes the uneven nature of low carbon energy transitions in the context of uneven geographical development and core/periphery asymmetries. It explores the impacts of transition for peripheral communities lacking political power and agglomerative advantages. While decentralised developments that emerge with energy transition promise to bring new opportunities to remote areas, factors of economic and political inequalities render those opportunities socially and spatially segregated. Exploring experiences of rural and exurban communities in South Wales, the paper establishes links between low carbon transition and its actually existing implications on the ground. It demonstrates that even if having an abundance of natural resource and physical space to harness low carbon energy, many rural communities are trapped in the chronic positions of energy peripheralization.

AB This research advances the hypothesis and establishes empirically that interpersonal population diversity, rather than fractionalization or polarization across ethnic groups, has been pivotal to the emergence, prevalence, recurrence, and severity of intrasocietal conflicts. Exploiting an exogenous source of variations in population diversity across nations and ethnic groups, as determined predominantly during the exodus of humans from Africa tens of thousands of years ago, the study demonstrates that population diversity, and its impact on the degree of diversity within ethnic groups, has contributed significantly to the risk and intensity of historical and contemporary civil conflicts. The findings arguably reflect the contribution of population diversity to the non-cohesiveness of society, as reflected partly in the prevalence of mistrust, the divergence in preferences for public goods and redistributive policies, and the degree of fractionalization and polarization across ethnic, linguistic, and religious groups.

AB The removal of dams and reservoirs may seem to be an unforeseen and sometimes controversial step in water management. The removal of barriers may be different for each country or region, as each differs greatly in terms of politics, economy and social and cultural awareness. This paper addresses the complex problem of removing dams on rivers and their connected reservoirs. We demonstrate the scales of the changes, including their major ecological, economic, and social impacts. Arguments and approaches to this problem vary across states and regions, depending on the political system, economy and culture, as confirmed by the qualitative and quantitative intensities of the dam removal process and its global geographical variation. The results indicate that the removal of dams on rivers and their connected reservoirs applies predominantly to smaller structures (< 2.5 m). The existing examples provide an important conclusion that dams and reservoirs should be considered with regard to the interrelations between people and the environment. Decisions to deconstruct hydraulic engineering structures (or, likewise, to construct them) have to be applied with scrutiny. Furthermore, all decision-making processes have to be consistent and unified and thus developed to improve the lack of strategies currently implemented across world.

AB What do authoritarian legislatures and legislators do? Would outcomes in dictatorships be different if they were absent? Why do dictatorships have legislatures in the first place? These questions represent central puzzles in the study of authoritarian politics and institutions. The introductory article to this special issue on legislatures in nondemocracies discusses what we now know about these assemblies; what the issue's articles contribute to this body of knowledge; and what future work might fruitfully look at. The special issue as a whole aims to advance the research agendas of both authoritarian institutions and legislative studies.

AB Why is the populist radical left and right on the rise across western Europe? Integrating theories on changing socio-political conflict with arguments about crises of political representation, we contend that electoral support for radical right and radical left parties is rooted in two distinct sets of socio-structural factors, but their translation into electoral choice is in both cases conditioned by the individual political discontent that originates in specific political dynamics. Relying on the European Social Survey (ESS) covering the period from 2002 to 2016 and Parlgov data, we show that the lack of responsiveness of mainstream parties to the changing social conflict structure provides critical opportunities for new challengers from both the radical left and the radical right, while voters' political discontent only works to heighten their success when these parties are in opposition. Our article contributes not only by offering an integrative account of the electoral appeal of the radical right and radical left parties. In emphasising the largely similar nature of short-term, political factors that condition the translation of the different sets of long-term, structural determinants into opting for these parties, critically, this article also contributes to understanding the electoral success of radical challengers across western Europe.

ID ECONOMIC-CRISIS; CONSEQUENCES; ELECTIONS; PARTIES; EUROPE; RISE
AB This article links the consequences of the Great Recession on protest and electoral politics. It innovates by combining the literature on economic voting with social movement research and by presenting the first integrated, large-scale empirical analysis of protest mobilisation and electoral outcomes in Europe. The economic voting literature offers important insights on how and under what conditions economic crises play out in the short-run. However, it tends to ignore the closely connected dynamics of opposition in the two arenas and the role of protests in politicising economic grievances. More specifically, it is argued that economic protests act as a 'signalling mechanism' by attributing blame to decision makers and by highlighting the political dimension of deteriorating economic conditions. Ultimately, massive protest mobilisation should, thus, amplify the impact of economic hardship on the electoral losses of incumbents and mainstream parties more generally. The empirical analysis to study this relationship relies on an original semi-automated protest event dataset combined with an updated dataset of electoral outcomes in 30 European countries from 2000 to 2015. The results indicate that the dynamics of economic protests and electoral punishment are closely related and point to a destabilisation of European party systems during the Great Recession.

AB This paper analyses the ideational interaction underlying attempts at regional integration and cooperation in Eurasia. While the ideas and values of the European Union have been relatively well-studied within the theory of Europeanisation, the key concepts, ideas, values and principles driving Eurasian regionalism have remained out of the main focus of Western scholarship. This paper aims to shed more light on thisideationalbasis of Eurasian regionalism by unveiling the discourse developed in Russian scholarship and available only in Russian. Understanding interactions between institutions will always remain partial as long as the ideational interaction is not addressed. Such concepts as 'integrative mentality', as a segment of the wider category 'foreign policy mentality', and the theory of neo-Eurasianism have been incorporated into Russian political discourse and therefore affect public opinion through specific interpretation of economic, political and cultural processes in the EU's near neighbourhood and the EU as an actor. The analysis presented in this paper indicates the development of newideationalcompetition, in addition to the well-documented geopolitical one. The paper also aspires to contribute to emerging research on public support to governmental strategic choices and self-legitimation of international organisations in Eurasia.

AB Since its inception in 2003, Cost Effectiveness and Resource Allocation journal has come a long way over the past 18 years. Possibly much longer than many of its contemporaries in the blossoming science of health economics might have anticipated. Today, entering 2020 it celebrates the Age of Maturity. We believe that in the third decade of XXI century the interdisciplinary science of health economics, will rejuvenate and come back to us younger than ever from its early historical roots almost a century ago. The spreading of economic globalization in several distinctive ways, either led by multinational business corporations or newly emerged Asian leadership, or both, is likely to make challenges for contemporary health systems far more serious. The fourth industrial revolution (cyber physical systems and artificial intelligence technology) and accelerated innovation in the field of E-Health and digital health, will probably change the workflow in medical and health care, and inevitably transform the labour market in the upcoming decades. So, let us be up to the task. Let us provide academic centres, industry-sponsored pharmaceutical and medical device innovation hubs, and governing authorities alike, with a powerful forum for debate on cost-effective resource allocation in the years to come.

AB In spite of the fact that the connection between exports of goods and services and economic growth has for quite some time been talked about, the examination of the relationship in light of recent global events such as economic policy uncertainty and geopolitical risks is yet to be given the required attention. Various empirical researches have demonstrated that the export-led growth hypothesis (ELGH) holds for singular nations in terms of overall economic development. However, this study re-examines the ELGH with a special focus on the absolute and mediating impact of economic policy uncertainties and geopolitical risks. With data spanning the period 1980 to 2018. Empirical results from the Autoregressive distributed lag model and the error correction models suggest that for Malaysia, Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) exerts a negative impact on growth evens as its moderating impact on exports leads to negative economic growth. On the other hand, the impact of Geopolitical risk on growth is both negative and positive but insignificant in the short-run and long-run respectively. The study suggests the government of Malaysia works to ensure macroeconomic and political stability to achieve export-driven growth in the country.

AB This article discusses the evolution of government-nonprofit relations at the regional level in Russia against the background of national-level restrictions on NGOs. Russia recently also introduced supportive policies and the article aims to trace the regional administrations' reactions to the dual realities of the federal government's posture towards nonprofits. Considerable variation was found in regional government-nonprofit relationships as well as deviation from national policy stances. Using a subnational comparative framework, this article addresses a gap in the literature and lays the groundwork for future cross-national comparisons of subnational variations of government-nonprofit relations in other authoritarian and hybrid political regimes.

AB This paper addresses the topic of social media users' polyvocal political activism facilitated by participatory culture and expressed through multimodal digital humour (including humorous memes) in the context of a threat of a regime. The focus of attention is political humour on the r/HongKong subreddit, specifically the posts pertinent to the ongoing boycott movement of multiple companies consequent upon their actions in response to the 2019 protests in Hong Kong. Apart from presenting the multimodal characteristics of the creative digital data through the lens of Multimodal Critical Discourse Analysis, the central aim is to discuss the functions of users' political humour online, offering various socio-pragmatic conclusions about the polyvocal participatory practice at hand. It is argued that this digital humour resides solely in the attention-grabbing form, with the otherwise serious posts performing informative and persuasive functions as they convey community members' socio-political critique. While disparaging the 'butts', online users do bonding through collectively expressing their political dissent (which also gives them psychological relief) and sharing subversive ideologies. The humorous items inform and warn potential punters and tacitly call for a boycott of the companies that bow to the regime, all in an act of solidarity with Hong Kong protesters.

ID SHOCKS; INFLATION; GDP
AB This paper investigates time-frequency co-movements between crude oil prices and interest rates. To test this relationship, the study applied a continuous wavelet and cross wavelet approaches to data from West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices and interest rates in the United States (U.S.). Results from the sample period revealed significant relationships, in the intermediate term, between WTI crude oil prices and U.S. interest rates. Moreover, co-movements between oil price and interest rate variables were especially sensitive during abnormal political events and periods of financial 'meltdown'. We further use Partial Wavelet Coherence (PWC) and Multiple Wavelet Coherence (MWC) methods to investigate the impacts of five major control variables namely GDP growth, unemployment, three-month Treasury bill, CPI index and industrial production index. The results show a powerful impact of control variables on oil-interest rates co-movements under different frequencies. Finally, we show evidence of co-integrating long run relationship between oil markets and control variables. These results have important implications for energy investors and policy makers.

AB A broad literature suggests that political regimes matter for the growth effect of natural resources. However, while several studies have concentrated on the difference between democracies and autocracies in this respect, an important topic overlooked so far is the differences between varieties of authoritarian regimes. This study uses the political variation across sub-national regions of the Russian Federation under Vladimir Putin to understand how differences in the extent of elite fragmentation in autocracies affects the influence of resource abundance on economic growth in the short run. We find that polities with fragmented elites underperform those with consolidated elites and link this effect to higher costs of fights over rents due to higher political uncertainty.

AB The Arctic has historically been a strategically important region for Russia, from before the Cold War to the recent efforts in increasing shipping along the Northern Sea Route. Russia holds the largest share of petroleum resources in the Arctic, the governance model for which has been changing over the past few decades based on the current political priorities, external events, and geophysical changes in the region. Following the conflict in Ukraine, the European Union and the United States adopted sanctions limiting the cooperation between Russian and western companies for Arctic offshore petroleum development. This paper analyses the transformation in national governance of natural resources in the Russian Arctic, focusing on offshore oil and gas. It provides a historical background of the governance model to facilitate the analysis of the effects of western sanctions on the current resource development and its regulation. Through the analysis of legal and policy documents, this paper provides an outlook for future developments in the Russian Arctic offshore resource governance.

AB The sudden onset of COVID-19 has challenged many social scientists to proceed without a robust theoretical and empirical foundation upon which to build. Addressing this challenge, particularly as it pertains to Eurasia, our multinational group of scholars draws on past and ongoing research to suggest a roadmap for a new pandemic politics research subfield. Key research questions include not only how states are responding to the new coronavirus, but also reciprocal interactions between the pandemic and society, political economy, regime type, center-periphery relations, and international security. The Foucauldian concept of "biopolitics" holds out particular promise as a theoretical framework.

AB This article revisits the prediction, made in 2010, that the 2010-2020 decade would likely be a period of growing instability in the United States and Western Europe Turchin P. 2018. This prediction was based on a computational model that quantified in the USA such structural-demographic forces for instability as popular immiseration, intraelite competition, and state weakness prior to 2010. Using these trends as inputs, the model calculated and projected forward in time the Political Stress Indicator, which in the past was strongly correlated with socio-political instability. Ortmans et al. Turchin P. 2010 conducted a similar structural-demographic study for the United Kingdom. Here we use the Cross-National Time-Series Data Archive for the US, UK, and several major Western European countries to assess these structural-demographic predictions. We find that such measures of socio-political instability as anti-government demonstrations and riots increased dramatically during the 2010-2020 decade in all of these countries.

ID IDENTITY; REVOLUTION; ETHNICITY; IMPACT
AB Based on a case study of Euromaidan Ukrainian nationalism, we argue that civic nationalism may derive more from a commitment to a particular political event than from a set of stable political ideas and principles. We concur that civic nationalism can be as exclusivist as ethnocultural nationalism, and we develop specific criteria and mechanisms of civic exclusion originating from the unique experience of participating in the Euromaidan event. Challenging the conceptual dichotomy of civic vs. ethnocultural nationalism, we suggest that these categories are still fruitful; however, they should be re-conceptualized. We try to clarify the relations between civic and ethnocultural forms of nationalism instead of simply considering them in opposition to each other. We show that a belief in the existence of a civic nation can legitimize the practices of othering, among them ethnocultural exclusion, that are undertaken in the name of a civic nation.

AB Total birth rates have fallen dramatically in many European countries during the last 40 years. Job and income instability caused by labor market polarization are significant drivers of declining birth rates because employment certainty and stability are crucial to childbirth planning among young adults. This article investigates the impact of job instability on the fertility intentions of young adults in Europe, focusing on employment protection legislation (EPL) in European countries. I use data from twenty-seven countries that participated in the European Social Survey in 2004 and 2010 to show that job instability measured as temporary employment, informal work, and unemployment decreases fertility intentions among European youth regardless of the EPL in the country. Unemployed young adults tend to plan less for having their first child in the countries with high EPL. Contrary to the hypotheses, multilevel modeling showed that young people in temporary or informal employment in countries with low EPL show decreases in their fertility intentions.

AB This article uses a unique dataset from the September 2019 municipal elections in St. Petersburg in order to examine empirically the efficacy of strategic voting under authoritarianism, as manifest in the effects of the "smart vote campaign" of Alexei Navalny in Russia. The analysis allows for the conclusion that the campaign, while technically similar to the vote advice applications that are now widespread in many democracies, was efficient enough to make a significant difference in the overtly authoritarian context. We demonstrate empirically that Navalny's call for strategic voting did indeed affect the behavior of the electorate, particularly by improving strategic coordination among opposition-minded voters; that the electoral results of the candidates backed by the "smart vote" campaign tended to be better than the electoral results of other non-United Russia candidates; and that as a result of the "smart vote" campaign, the dominant party's electoral results deteriorated quite visibly.

AB The environmental agenda has proven to be an important factor in political and social protests in Russia across 2018 and 2019. The decision to open a landfill near the Shies station in the Arkhangelsk region strengthened environmental protest throughout Russia, paving the way for discursive changes and actual participation in politics. Nevertheless, the case of the this landfill site cannot be seen an aberration; the state of the environment is not only an object but also a subject of politics in many countries across the world. What makes a social issue take on the features of a political discussion which requires a specific political solution to be made? The aim of this study is to identify the mechanisms behind the politicization of environmental discourse in Russia based on the case of this landfill site in Arkhangelsk region. We will demonstrate how a specific political decision was implemented by the authorities after being made outside of public discussion. The paper will also consider how, among competing discourses, the environmental problem became dominant and then became politicalized among citizens. The empirical basis of the study is 19 semi-structured interviews with residents of the Arkhangelsk region. The research methodology is discourse analysis within the argumentative traction. We will focus solely on argumentative constructions which subjects use to substantiate their position. As a result, in the article we will show that the politicization of discourse and high political mobilization occurred due to three main mechanisms that worked simultaneously: (1) the view that the decision made by the authorities was illegitimate; (2) the view that the whole situation was unfair; and (3) the allocation of blame to certain political actors.

AB Do states manage to build education systems that produce students with political values they uphold? We test the indoctrination hypothesis using World Value Survey data spanning 96 countries. We devise an empirical strategy that can identify the effects of education on political values by using information about the political regime under which individuals live, and regimes under which they got educated. Our results suggest that state indoctrination is at work. For example, we find that higher education increases voting behavior by at least 45 percent more for cohorts that have studied in a democratic rather than an autocratic country.

AB This paper considers local activists' efforts to initiate public discussions about contested territories in St. Petersburg, and to resist political decisions about their (re)development. It also questions to what degree such grassroots efforts become political and analyzes different contexts of, and barriers to, politicization. By complementing sociological theorization about civic engagement and civic participation with French pragmatism, we examine how these activists constantly shift between informal, context-specific forms of protest and more institutionalized and politicized ones. Using a case study approach, we describe and compare two recent conflicts in St. Petersburg where local residents resisted (re)development projects imposed by political and economic elites: the defense of the Yurgens House in the historic city center against its expected demolition, and the protest against renovation in Alexandrino, a park area on the city's periphery. Our analysis is based on semi-structured interviews with local activists, participant and non-participant observation at public rallies and other gatherings, and qualitative analysis of protesters' communication practices on social networks. We demonstrate that external political and social constraints encourage activists to be flexible in their forms of engagement, deploying a wide repertoire of tools of contestation: using local knowledge tactically, operating rationally within legal frameworks, and addressing broad audiences in search of public justification and support. We conclude that, whether these local activists remain at the level of informal place-based initiatives or opt for more institutionalized and professionalized forms of civic participation, they insistently reject claims that their efforts have a political rationale.

ID DESIGN; GOVERNANCE; ENGLAND
AB The period from 2013 to 2019 was one of relative continuity in policies for physical education (PE), school sport and physical activity (PESSPA) in England. Starting from the advent of the government's flagship PE and Sport Premium (PES Premium) initiative in 2013, the end of the period was reached 20 with renewed uncertainty in 2020 about the future of PESSPA policy. It is therefore an appropriate point for this article to 'take stock' of PESSPA policies and their consequences since 2013. The political science literature on policy design underpins the approach to considering the mix of both policy goals and those instruments used by governments to achieve them. To do so, a comprehensive set of policy documents, published reports, academic literature and empirical research on schools' use of the PES Premium was interrogated. Policy goals articulated by government since 2013 reinforced, rather than resolved, long-standing debates about the purpose of PESSPA. Health-related objectives rose in prominence, but sat uneasily alongside continued commitments to competitive sport. Only a narrow range of the policy instruments available to governments were used in pursuit of their policy goals. PES Premium funding was solely distributed to primary schools, with limited use of regulation and information systems to shape PESSPA provision. These aspects of policy design contributed to increasing reliance on external coaches in primary schools and indicators of a decline in secondary school provision and participation, resonant of prioritisation of short-term approaches over longer-term strategic development. Possibilities for improving future PESSPA policies are considered as a result.

DE Russian Federation; outsourcing; NGOs; social services; sub-national

AB Our research bears on two critical issues for contemporary Russia: federal-regional power relations; and whether Moscow can modernize institutions and address dissatisfaction with social service delivery, a major political issue. It is the first comprehensive study of a major 2015 reform that ended the state monopoly over service provision and initiated outsourcing (contracting out) to socially oriented non-profits (SONPOs) and other non-state organizations. We find substantial interregional variation. Statistical tests of economic, political, and institutional explanations show that only the economic helps to explain variation across Russia's regions. We rely on comparisons of six regions, drawing on semi-structured interviews to gain a contextualized understanding of their varied implementation strategies. Key findings are that regional leaders demonstrated agency in crafting diverse strategies, while the Center showed flexibility. Whether Moscow can modernize public services remains unclear, though there is some evidence of improvement since the beginning of the outsourcing reform.

AB The 1958 Lacy-Zarubin agreement on cultural, educational and scientific exchanges marked decades of people-to-people exchanges between the United States and the Soviet Union. Despite the Cold War tensions and mutually propagated adversarial images, the exchanges had never been interrupted and remained unbroken until the Soviet Union dissolved. This essay argues that due to the 1958 general agreement and a number of co-operative agreements that had the status of treaties and international acts issued under the authority of the US State Department and the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the exchanges could not proceed without diplomatic supervision. This peculiarity puts academic and technical exchanges specifically into the framework of science diplomacy, which is considered a diplomatic tool for implementing a nation state's foreign policy goals determined by political power.

ID INSTITUTIONS; CORRUPTION; CAPTURE; PERFORMANCE; CONNECTIONS; COMMITMENT;

AB What characteristics of firms give them the confidence to invest in settings rife with expropriation by local officials? Empirically, firms in the developing world often face the threat of expropriation from local agents of the state rather than a centralized autocrat. Because policing local officials is costly, the state cannot easily credibly commit to doing so. This has negative consequences for investment. We argue that one solution is to allow firms to approach the state directly to ask for intervention. Not all firms are equally able to successfully get the attention of the state, however, so this mechanism only works for some. We develop an argument about the firm-level characteristics - large-scale employment, political connections, foreign ownership, and business association membership - that should make the central state more attentive to calls for help. Because firm with these characteristics are more likely to secure intervention against predatory bureaucrats, the latter are less likely to try to expropriate them. These firms' investment decisions should be less sensitive to local expropriation than other firms. We test this argument using data on cases of decentralized expropriation across Russia's regions and firm-level data from a cross-regional, large scale survey of Russian firms.

AB In this paper, we build a theory that presents the process of succession at the subnational level as bargaining between the region and the center. The region should first be able to produce qualifying candidates for successor status, which requires incumbent control. If potential successors emerge and one is designated as such by the incumbent, the central authorities still need to accept such a candidate as the new leader. The center's strength (depending on the level of centralization) and the region's strength (depending on regional elite cohesion) shape this negotiation. Using biographical data on subnational political elites in Tatarstan and Bashkortostan in the 1990s and 2000s, we construct elite social networks and demonstrate how and why we observe leader succession in Tatarstan in 2010, but not in Bashkortostan.

AB This article attempts to open up the 'black box' of the Russian Presidential Administration ('the Kremlin'). Borrowing from the literature on institutional presidencies and institutional approaches to authoritarianism, I argue that the administration institutionalised over the years of study, 1994-2012. More stable and predictable procedures enhanced administrative presidential powers but personalism and non-compliance with presidential orders remained. Original data on budget, staff, units, organisational structure and presidential assignments demonstrate that presidential power ought to be conceptualised as a polymorphous phenomenon that varies depending on the level of analysis. Researchers should refrain from over-personalising accounts of authoritarian regimes at the expense of more structural, organisational elements such as 'institutional presidencies'.

TI NETWORK VS MESSAGE IN PROTEST DIFFUSION ON SOCIAL MEDIA: THEORETICAL AND

AB Social media can act as an environment that accumulates and concentrates protest sentiment before it brings people to the streets. The social ties that connect people online are similar to their offline ties, and the structure of social ties can affect the diffusion of both the protest-related information and the protest itself. In addition, social media can serve as core platforms or environments for articulating collective goals and identities. This article builds on previous scholarship that has developed these ideas, and extends it with an empirical analysis of the Venezuelan Twittersphere during the political unrest in that country. Short messages - tweets - are the basic building blocks of online protest behavior on Twitter. Some of these tweets get virally retweeted so can achieve very broad audiences. These viral tweets are arguably of key importance for the articulation of protest sentiment. However, what kind of tweet tends to become viral? Is it a tweet posted by someone with a fortunate position in the social media network, or one that stands out as particularly catchy or emotional? We formalize and test these competing hypotheses using two groups of empirically observable features characterizing either the author of a tweet or its content. The first group of features includes the average number of followers the retweeting users have, the total number of followers the author of the original tweet has, whether the author or a retweeter are verified Twitter users, etc. The other group describes the content of the tweet and includes binary indicators of whether the tweet contains links to external platforms, emojis, or question or exclamation marks. The dependent variable is the total number of retweets. We analyze over 5.7 million unique tweets using modern data science approaches and methods (e.g. a LASSO-regression model, cross-validation, etc.) and find that the first-group features are much more informative for modeling the dependent variable. This finding turns out to be very robust and holds for both OLS and LASSO models. In addition, given the increasing importance that social media bots - i.e. automated accounts that are able to post retweet, among other things - have recently gained for political communication, we also perform robustness checks by removing bots from the analysis. We find that the network characteristics matter more than the content-related features under study.

TI NON-WEST MODEL: DOES THE CIVILIZATION-STATE EXIST?

LA Russian
DT Article
DE civilization-state; China; guanxi; India; dharma; Eurasionism;
   civilizationism; identity; nation-state; Arab nationalism; religion
AB The article reviews some aspects of civilizationism as a trend in self-positioning strategies as adopted by several Asian states, primarily by China and India, as well as some other nations. Close attention is paid to the concept of the civilization-state (CS), as distinct from the nation state (NS). This allows the specific characteristics of the largest non-Western nations to be unveiled; these are linked to their thousand-year history, traditional cultural codes (deeply rooted in both public and elite mindsets), and the resentment of universalism and of any attempts to impose an alien system of values upon them. It is inferred that Russia meets the civilization-state criteria in such a way that aligns it with the nation state category; within this frame of reference, certain states are shown to fall in between these two categories, as they can demonstrate only a limited range of prerequisites to qualify their inclusion on the civilization-state list. In this context, a number of states in the Arab World are referenced as examples. Two different interpretations of the notion of "civilizatianism" are revealed by examining this definition of the nature and political practices of the states. The authors, representing the interests of the mainstream political bodies of Asian civilization-states, tend to use this notion in order to emphasize their spiritual and cultural supremacy in response to the exclusive claims to the global leadership, as well as to promote the idea of their "responsible" attitude to society governance and handling of global issues. However, their adversaries treat civilizationism as synonymous with authoritarianism, disrespecting the rights of minorities, archaic political practices, and national egoism. The author views the concept of the civilization-state not only as a weapon of ideological and political struggles, but also as a useful instrument for detecting the genuine peculiarities of such states, distinguishing them from the models based on the principles of neo-liberal democracy and universalism.

AB Drawing on experimental games and surveys conducted with students at two universities in Russia, we compare the behavioral, attitudinal, and demographic traits of students seeking public sector employment to the traits of their peers seeking jobs in the private sector. Contrary to similar studies conducted in other high-corruption contexts, such as India, we find evidence that students who prefer a public sector career display less willingness to cheat or bribe in experimental games as well as higher levels of altruism. However, disaggregating public sector career paths reveals distinctions between the federal civil service and other types of public sector employment, with federal government positions attracting students who exhibit some similarities with their peers aspiring to private sector careers. We discuss multiple interpretations consistent with our findings, each of which has implications for the creation of effective anti-corruption policies and for understanding of state capacity in contexts where corruption is widespread.

DE Ethnolinguistic conflict; language education policy; free choice and
   compulsory learning; ethnic republics; Russia's minority languages
AB Until recently, not only students of the titular nationalities (ethnicities) learned their native language but also ethnic Russians and other nationalities in some ethnic republics of Russia had to learn titular state languages of those republics. The political campaign in Russia against the compulsory teaching of state languages of republics started two years ago and culminated in the adoption of the amendment to the Russian education law on 3 August 2018. The law enacted some additional mechanisms to ensure the voluntary study of non-Russian languages. The law adoption signified the escalation of the conflict around linguistic rights and the compulsory study of state language. The problem is that the official discources typically overshadow the discourses of individuals and non-govenrmental ogranization who have their own language attitudes and agendas, which distorts the depiction of the conflict. In this paper, we will study official and public discourses together, combining the 'top-down' and 'bottom-up' perspectives, in order to explore both the language policy and language ideologies, and, thus, to provide a multifaceted picture of the conflict. We use policy analysis and discourse analysis to study official documents, surveys, mass media, social media discussions.

ID UNITED-KINGDOM; LONG HISTORY; BREXIT; DISINTEGRATION
AB The United Kingdom, a country with 67 million people and the world's fifth largest economy, formally withdrew from the European Union on 31 January 2020. Apart from the loss of Greenland in 1985, the Union has been expanding for decades; now for the first time in its history it is shrinking. The existing literature on Brexit focuses mainly on Great Britain and, to a lesser extent, the European Union. The latter material predominantly addresses institutional issues. There have been a number of scholarly assessments of differentiated integration and disintegration in the EU after Brexit, as well as of the changing nexus between intergovernmental and supranational instruments. This article contributes to a broader debate on the subsequent evolution of European integration with an emphasis on its intrinsic driving forces, rather than on forms and methods. Our analysis shows that, although the European Union will suffer significant economic, political and semantic losses, Brexit may also galvanize the integration process. It may create the necessary premises for the emergence of two competing democratic regimes in Europe. This new situation draws a line under the 30-year period (since the fall of the Berlin Wall) of the EU's ideological and institutional dominance as an uncontested model of European development. Potential political and normative rivalry with the United Kingdom may be extremely stimulating for the European Union, pushing it to reassess its attitudes, reject dogma and develop a new integration ideology that would respond to the challenges of unchecked economic globalization and set aside outdated patterns of the bipolar world order.

AB The article explores transformation of EU party-political space and the changing patterns of inter-parliamentary interaction in the European Parliament after 2019 EP elections. The article explores basic characteristics of EU party-political space. It concludes that a two-dimensional space of political self identification has emerged in the European Parliament: the classical right-left axis is supplemented by a properly formed axis "supporters of deeper integration - eurosceptics". It demonstrates that the formation of a stable axis "supporters of deeper integration - eurosceptics" leads to the erosion of the traditional consensus culture in the EP. The more complex EP political landscape leads to greater flexibility. Instead of stable unions, various ad hoc issue driven coalitions will play an increasing role in the EP. Given the new balance of power between pro-integration and eurosceptic parties, the European Parliament is unlikely to be able to play the traditional role of the EU's most pro-integration institution; its ability to influence the legislative and political process in the EU will decrease.

AB The answer to the question of science as a political agent intends to show how philosophy of science and technology intersects with political philosophy, and science and technology studies (STS) intervene into the public discourse agenda on the nature of modernity and post-modernity, the prospects of civilization, the role of scientific and technological development, the growing influence of the media. The main feature of modernity is that science and technology define points of growth in all areas of public life. However, the question arises: does this make science a political agent? Were there any such precedents at all? And what is political agency in terms of science? Is there a place for political agency in the mission of the scientist? The analysis of the problem begins with the clarification of its meaning: either we mean political power or the power of knowledge? Further, the forms of implementation of this agency in theoretical and practical activity of scientists are traced. Thus, the article proposes a general theoretical solution to this problem as well as its illustration in scientists' participation by the resolution of socially significant problems.

SO RESEARCH & POLITICS

DE Politically connected businesspeople; state-business relations; Russia
ID FIRM PERFORMANCE; BENEFITS; MARKET
AB Extensive literature shows that businesspeople thrive on political connections. Most research, however, does not differentiate between types of political connection, thus effectively assuming that economic return on being connected should not differ systematically between federal and regional, legislative and executive, formal and informal connections. We collect a unique comprehensive dataset on Russia's richest businesspeople in 2003-2010 and demonstrate that only certain types of connections work, depending on the political context. Our analysis shows that as Russian politics became centralized and the federal executive more powerful during the 2000s, businesspeople with informal connections to the federal executive increased their fortunes much faster compared with everyone else-including those with any other type of connections. Businesspeople's wealth thus dynamically reflected these important political changes. This suggests a procedure for inferring nominally unobservable changes in the political system from politically connected businesspeople's fortunes, while also shedding additional light on the institutional origins of informality in Russian politics today.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the links between investment activity and personal contacts for small- and medium-sized firms with public officials at the subnational level in Russia. Design/methodology/approach A list-experiment design, using a survey of 21,000 Russian firms in 2017, was used to evaluate the importance of personal connections with officials for conducting business. Findings A total of 27% of firms without investment and 37% with investment considered personal connections with officials an important factor for doing business. The importance of such contacts was lower in regions with a better investment climate. However, a higher proportion of firms were likely to invest in the regions where higher importance was placed on political connections. Therefore, in Russia in the mid-2010s, investment from politically connected firms did not crowd out investment from other firms. Research limitations/implications Although the available data did not allow causality to be defined, the research shows that political connections are important for investors in emerging markets and that the importance of political connections diminishes with improvement in the business climate. Originality/value This paper provides a quantitative estimate of the relationship between political connections and firm investment in Russia, an example of large emerging economy. This relationship is moderated by institutional quality at the subnational level. The results provide empirical support for the theory of limited access orders elaborated byNorthet al.(2009), and stress the importance of rents and their productive utilization for the development of emerging economies.

AB In northwestern Siberia, rivers historically played an essential role in structuring economic, cultural, and administrative space. The rivers' role in spatial perception is reflected in vocabulary of some local languages. With the recent development of roads and railroads, a new way has emerged to structure socioeconomic and political space. The two systems of spatial structuring contradict each other, and their relative importance for different local groups depends on their professional and ethnocultural affiliation. This leads to different perceptions of space, distances, and geographic directions by the members of these groups. Furthermore, since the administrative borders reflect the "river" system, but the administrative power is increasingly projected along the roads and railroads, the conflict between the two systems has a political dimension.

AB Using a multidisciplinary approach, this report analyzes the current transformation of the world-order architecture. It is noted that the speed and depth of this transformation is unprecedented for peacetime over the past 200 years. One of the most important indicators of turbulence is a certain deglobalization of the world economy. A study of the technological, social, economic, and political variables of social change has revealed that the traditional (for developed countries) social contract between government, business, and civil society has come to a crisis. This social contract has been in effect for more than half a century, since the times before globalization, the times of an industrial and bipolar world. Its inconsistency with modern realities, coupled with the inability of the old political center to offer convincing approaches to its modernization, has polarized societies and weakened social cohesion in the developed part of the world. As a result, populist and isolationist political forces have come to power. It is these forces that have started the dismantling of the existing system of global governance and its norms and institutions. The main contradiction of the current transformation in the world order is an attempt to bring back the polycentric world to a unipolar architecture with the dominance of the United States. The most likely scenario for resolving this contradiction is to create a new bipolarity. The author of the report expresses his views on the possible outlines of Russia's foreign policy, which would enable the country to adapt to the bipolarity of the 21st century and to a new role as a balance-keeper. A new design of global architecture is proposed, which is based on multilateral responsible leadership.

DE political communication; Internet space; information capsule;

AB In the context of the intensive development of the Internet as a space of mass political communications, the problem of the applicability of classical models of political communication to information and communication online processes becomes urgent. The significant substantive and functional differences between the traditional offline space and the contemporary network space, as well as the corresponding differences between the phenomena of offline and online masses, shown in this article, lead us to the conclusion that it is necessary to revise the explanatory potential of classical communication models and adapt them to network space. To form communication models adequate to the contemporary conditions and the functioning of the Internet, the authors consider such a structural component of political communications in the network space as information capsules. This concept refers to an information and communication structure, within which ideas, symbols, meanings, beliefs, opinions circulating in its closed space do not change due to a critical understanding of information and the perception of alternative explanatory models, but, on the contrary, they are only preserved, self-supported, fixed and even amplified by multiple repetitions, discussion, approval among like-minded people. The work shows that most online resources (news feeds on social media, network communities, search services) have characteristics that allow them to be classified as information capsules. The authors analyze the conditions for maintaining the stability of such information capsules, which are necessary for the implementation of mass political communication in the Internet space. The work concludes that, at the macro level, most of the processes of mass political communication on the Internet can be reduced to the following: various political actors form and maintain the stable functioning of their own information capsules, necessary for the transmission of certain political meanings, ideas and values; they also transform and destroy similar information capsules of political opponents, which fits into the logic of the system of contemporary information warfare.

AB The article provides a comprehensive study and systematization of the main approaches and theories to the study of digital environmental activism based on a related-literature analysis. The authors came to the conclusion that, in the conceptualization of a digital environmental activism, researchers place emphasis either on the features of the digital technologies that drive such activity, or on the basis of the environmental mobilization itself. In this work, combining both approaches with digital environmental activism, the authors understand the voluntary collective activity around common environmental interests and values that are implemented publicly and voluntarily through the use of new informational and communication technologies. The article discusses the main features of digital environmental activism, which include, on the one hand, the enhancement of environmental knowledge, and the change in the paradigm of interaction between actors in which they become not only consumers of information, but also its active producers. On the other hand, digital practices contribute to the alienation of users from the real protest movement by limiting them to virtual means of interaction; additionally, this form of participation is not accessible to all citizens, thereby generating new forms of digital inequality and social distances. The authors examined various types of digital participation which include clicktivism, meta-voting, self-affirmation, e-finance, political consumer protection, digital petitions, botivism, data activity, and hacktivism. The authors critically assess both established and new theoretical approaches to the study of digital eco-activism such as Castells' theory of network society, deliberative democracy, "citizen science", socio-psychological theories to explain environmental behavior, and Digital Environmental Humanities. The author's vision of possible options for data synthesis in the study of environmental online activism for the Russian scientific context is proposed.

AB The paper deals with the question of relation between the individual and collective memory. It is shown that the approaches to research of individual and collective memory usually differ: individual memory is seen as an object of research of natural sciences and epistemology, while collective memory is studied by political science, sociology, history and other social sciences and humanities. It is substantiated that phenomena of collective memory are described via concepts that belong to individual memory - amnesia, oblivion, memory "trauma" etc., that in this case can be regarded as metaphors. The unbreakable link of collective memory and collective knowledge is shown. It is demonstrated that one of the most important mechanisms of connection between individual and collective memory is empathy that helps to "live through" the memory of the Other that is expressed in language or other sign means. It is shown that one of the interlinking concepts in the research of individual and collective memory is the concept of narrative - both the autobiographical narrative as a personal life story of an individual, and the narrative as the history of the group - of the people, of nation etc. The productiveness of common research of individual and collective memory on the same methodological basis is substantiated.

AB The article presents the results of an analysis of political values as fundamental foundations of young people's civic consciousness. The theoretical basis of the study is the political-psychological approach and the provisions of Ronald Inglehart's conception. Political values in this work are defined as semantic dominants in the sphere of politics. They are hierarchically ordered, related to the needs of the individual, and they regulate political behavior. The empirical basis of the study is materials from the all-Russian representative survey of the Russian youth. The hierarchy of young people's political values was determined on the basis of an evaluative scaling of value concepts. The survey also included questions to determine citizens' value orientations on the scale "materialism/post-materialism" used in the World Value Survey. The results of the study show that human rights, peace, security, freedom, justice, law and order are important political values for the Russian youth. These value categories have no ideological connotations. The authors show that over the past decade there has been a change in young people's preferences towards the values of post-materialism. At present, there is a relative balance between the materialistic and post-materialistic value orientations of young people. This can be explained by the generational heterogeneity of modern youth, as well as by the peculiarities of their socialization conditions. The analysis of the value orientations of different age cohorts in the structure of the youth allowed highlighting several key points. Depending on the age of the respondent, there is an increase in the importance of the values of legality, patriotism and personal initiative. The inverse relationship-a decrease in significance from younger cohorts to older ones-is revealed in relation to the values of human rights, equality, freedom and justice. The authors conclude that post-materialistic values are gaining stronger position in the minds of the younger generation. However, it is premature to say that there has been a value shift towards post-materialism. Actualized post-materialist values encourage young people's civic engagement in real and virtual spaces.

DE Central Europe; Hungary; Poland; budget allocation; anti-crisis package
AB The article examines the anatomy of the conflict of Hungary and Poland with the European Commission over the mechanism of budget allocation, which created another big "headache" for Brussels against the backdrop of other problems, such as post-Brexit and COVID-19. The relations between the conflicting parties have been developing in different ways at certain stages of integration and convergence. In practice, they turned out to be more complicated than the parties initially imagined when deciding on the accession of the Central European countries to the European Union. On the one hand, as the CE countries "get used" to the European system, they feel more confident and, knowing its imperfections, more often either deviate from the norms previously adopted in the EU or offer their own vision. On the other hand, the European Union still refuses to perceive these countries as absolutely equal members, does not see their regional and historical specifics and tries to adapt them to itself. This increases the latent conflict within the European Union and stimulates within it a coalition of States that support looser political integration. Taking into account the history of relations between the EU and the countries of Central Europe and the evolution of the internal political environment in the Visegrad countries, the problem is explored for the first time.

DT Editorial Material
DE Art value; ethnography; temporality; cultural institutions; art practice
ID CONTEMPORARY-ART; SOCIOLOGY
AB This special issue brings together ethnographic scholarship to explore the interlinking of diverse personal, social and larger institutional forms in and through which artistic value emerges. Rather than being inherent in the formal features of art objects or merely a discursive construct, value as craft signifies an arena in which beliefs, ideologies, and histories interweave with art practices, events, and materialities. The articles included in this issue, then, highlight both the constructed and performative aspects of artistic values through a common focus on ethnography and a shared emphasis on temporality, practice, and institutional forms. Accordingly, art is a process both crafted - composed of judgements and social interaction - and crafting - able to individually or collectively mobilise and enable desiring investments in its capacity as art. The interdisciplinary effort at hand retains the sociological ethos and political implications of social constructionism, while looking at how acts of valuation enable affective, agential and aesthetic responses.

ID DEMOCRACY; POLITICS; AUTOCRACY; UKRAINE; SOCIETY; VALUES
AB The phenomenon of color revolutions has occupied a prominent place in Russian politics for a good reason. The major threat of color revolutions as modern political warfare designed by Western countries deeply affected the political process in Russia since 2005. It may have appeared that the imperative of resisting them was the result of a non-democratic regime reacting to neighboring countries' uprisings. Some portrayed it as authoritarian learning. This paper suggests that the counteractions stemmed from the interests of disunited Russian elite groups who were seeking opportunities to reinforce their dominance and capitalize on the idea of significant external threats. The phenomenon reshaped the balance within elite groups and led to the consolidation of law enforcement networks on the eve of Putin's third term. Further, the prevailing perception of color revolutions discouraged any elite splits that could lead to proto-democratic rules.

AB The article is devoted to economic consequences of the demands of the U.S. President Donald Trump to European NATO allies to increase defense spendings in the context of intensified European defense cooperation (in particular, the implementation of the PESCO initiative). Within NATO, a line of tension "West-East" or "old-new members" has been identified, due to both economic (the size and level of the economies' development) and political (attitude to the USA as a guarantor of security) reasons. European states have committed to increase spendings both within NATO (defense investment pledge) and within PESCO. On the one hand, the development of the European defense identity and the growth of defense spendings will in any case serve to strengthen the overall NATO capabilities. On the other hand, in the medium and long term these measures are unlikely to lead to real strategic autonomy of Europe, although they are aimed at strengthening support for the military-industrial complex of the largest European states. The U.S. considers such policy as a challenge, given that American defense contractors have traditionally been involved in the distribution of defense orders in Europe (while the U.S. market is nearly closed for European companies). Under conditions of growing uncertainty and the crisis of globalization, support for defense industry enterprises can create additional impetus for internationalization of this economy sector, without which European products are unlikely to remain competitive in the global arms export market. The analysis shows that France as a country with one of the most technologically advanced military-industrial complexes will be the main "motor" and, most likely, the beneficiary of strengthening defense cooperation in Europe. Moreover, an additional factor of French ambitions may be a significant share of state participation in the defense sector of the economy and, in general, the strongest (in comparison with Germany and the UK)"national link" of the industry.

AB The article discusses the development of wheat export, which is the main grain crop in the structure of production and export of Russia. The record crop of grain crops in 2017 provided a good basis for the activation of Russian grain exporters in the world market. An analysis of geographical areas by source of grain export showed that crop growth allowed Russia to become a leader, as the main North American and European competitors experienced certain difficulties that led to a reduction in their export potential. The main geographical areas in which there is an increase in demand for wheat are the countries of Africa and Asia, whose population needs a more affordable form of food, which have become the main importers for Russian wheat along with Egypt and Turkey. Russia mainly exports low-grade wheat of the 4th and 5th grade; therefore, such wheat at a lower price and relatively high level of protein content is competitive in a number of foreign markets. The key problems for the export of Russian wheat are unstable gross grain harvests in Russia, which determine the search for innovative-intensive methods of increasing the yield and its stability, and the development of transport and logistics infrastructure. It is necessary to increase port capacities due to the Baltic and Far East directions in the context of political contradictions between Russia and Turkey and expanding the geography of wheat supplies to Africa and Southeast Asia for Russia makes sense. This will not only increase the competitiveness of exports, but also create additional incentives to increase grain production in a number of regions of the country remote from the Azov-Black Sea ports.

AB This article focuses on identifying the specifics of the new segment of online media-tactical media. We study the information and organizational resources of the media in promoting the ideology of political protest and implementation of political projects in the media activist practices. Our article focuses on the identification of formational features of tactical media, on the clarification of the category of tactical media, which began to play an important role in mobilizing the political processes and on the definition of their functions in the global information space. The availability of the newest information technologies for a wide range of users made relatively easy the creation of an electronic newspaper or any other mass media product. Tactical media have proven to be cost-effective and technologically advanced communication tools, which include a free radio and mini-FM, cable TV, etc. The definition of "tactical" emphasizes the mobility of these media, which gives the advantage over such "strategic" players, as the big business and the state. Their activity demonstrates the dialectic of global and local, by other words, the tendency of glocalization.

DT Article

AB This article examines how disability and sexuality are represented in today's Russian media, and how disabled people navigate these understandings. Drawing on online storytelling and first person stories about sexuality told by disabled people in the public sphere, the article provides a qualitative account of people with disabilities, journalists and civil rights advocates, analyzing how contemporary Russians with disabilities narrate their own lives in public forums. The focus of their stories, as well as the accounts of eyewitnesses, volunteers in the institutions, is on the constraints and limits of sexuality and intimacy spheres imposed by the professionals, families and wider society. This article also interprets the narratives behind disabled people's sexuality circulating in contemporary Russia through digital networks, in combination with qualitative data from primary sources: disability activists and two journalists with and without disability in Moscow. It is argued that the telling of these stories in a public forum is a political act. In personal stories about sexual, bodily experiences told in the interviews or autobiographical texts, self-presentations and discussions in social networks, the voices of people are heard, permitting emancipation from previous categories. However, disability always remains with them, playing an important role in social lives of these people and in their sexual experiences and identities, becoming the cornerstone of the personal and collective re-defining of themselves. Using ideas of "visibility politics" (Arendt), queer/crip kinship and intimate citizenship (Plummer), the authors demonstrate how someone might choose to speak publicly about a topic and how this understanding develops cultural understandings of contemporary Russia.

DT Article
DE special humanitarian expertise; freedom of speech; counter-extremism;
   academic rights and freedoms
AB In the late 1990s and early 2000s, democratically-minded scientists built the institutional framework for forensic expertise in the humanities and contributed to setting the boundaries of freedom of speech, actively cooperating in this with law enforcement agencies. This was due to the idea of these experts about the danger of 'Russian fascism' (neo-Nazism) and about the required civic stance of a scientist. In this, democratic science sided with the state in its disputes with conservative-nationalist circles, often clashing in courts with conservative academics who defended nationalist views in the courts. As a result, at this time, the institution of special forensic examination was formed as a whole and research methods appeared, which were based on the experience of conducting such examinations. In the second half of the 2000s, the institution of expertise was intercepted by representatives of conservative science with the active participation of the state. Apparently, it was no coincidence that this coincided with the emergence of special anti-extremist legislation, which began to actively narrow the space for freedom of speech. As a result, part of the academic community not only participated in the application of anti-extremist legislation, but also contributed to its scientific legitimation. Then the parties actually changed places: if in the first period representatives of the democratic community were on the side of the accusation, now in the new conditions they are on the side of the defense against representatives of conservative science who actively support the position of the state. Thus, the article focuses on this interception of the institution of special forensic expertise, initially created in cooperation between civil society, the academic community ('provincial science') and the state, and handing it over to political opponents in 'native science'.

   sovereignty; neocolonialism; decoloniality; colonial studies

AB The article analyses the evolution and partial rethinking of the political theory of decolonization in the context of the profound changes that have occurred since the adoption in 1960 of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples by the 15th session of the UN General Assembly, at the initiative of the USSR. With the need for both the ontological and epistemological reassessment of the processes that have evolved and developed over the past 60 years in the current stage of global political relations, in the contexts of uncompleted decolonization and the preservation of elements of coloniality in international relations as a whole globally, but also in many countries of the former colonial periphery domestically, the authors believe this rethinking is thus justified. In this regard, the authors give their critical assessment of the modem research field of decolonization, analyzing the key theoretical doctrines, concepts, and schools of thought - postcolonialism, decoloniality, subalternity, etc. As a result of their critical analysis, it is concluded that in political science, the main focus of modem theoretical works on decolonization has shifted from the previous focus on theoretical issues and the practical agenda of politics, economics, and state building to less tangible areas (information sphere, science, culture, art, language and etc.) or deeply subjective domains (consciousness, self-identification, representation, memory). Basing on generalizing the practical experience, history, results, and consequences of decolonization, the authors systematize the evolution of coloniality in international relations and the global economy in recent times, the authors offer their own three-element taxonomy of the transformation. They distinguish the following three stages of the development and qualitative metamorphoses of coloniality: a) the version that existed under the condition of the classical colonial domination of European nations at the end of the 19th and the first half of the 20th century; b) the coloniality of neocolonialism, dominant since the middle of the 20th century to the dissolution of the Socialist (Soviet) Block; and c) the current type formed under and by the conditions of globalization. The logical next step towards post-nco-colonialism is the challenge of a new decolonization, whose basic goals would be a multiplicity of development options, the inviolability and preservation of the existing systems of values, freedom of the choice in selecting paths, and models of development, cultures, science, and language.

AB The article presents the results of studies that aimed to identify the civic consciousness of modern Russian high school students. The theoretical basis of the study was a political and psychological approach, in which citizenship is determined by a combination of cognitive, value-motivational, emotional, and behavioral components of the personality, and is expressed in its relationship with the state and society. Empirical data collection, processing, and analysis were carried out using a complex of quantitative and qualitative methods, including formal interviews, projective methods (unfinished sentences, psychological drawing), and an expert survey. Based on the analysis of empirical data, structurally meaningful characteristics of the civic consciousness of state school students (aged 15-18) were revealed. The analysis shows that young people have cognitively poor, contradictory, and stereotypical representations about Russia, including its social and political structure and affairs with the outside world; they have contradicting feelings about their personal future (mainly positive) and the future of their country (mainly negative), And their civic involvement is poor due to distrust and disinterest in social engagement. The conceptual and symbolic side of being a citizen can be described as unformed; state school students in Russia have no examples of an 'ideal citizen' to recognize and model themselves on. We found out that the cohorts of Russian state school students are heterogeneous in value-emotional terms: orientation to values of survival and values of self-expression, as well as emotional attitude to Russia as a country (positive) and Russia as a state (negative). As a result, it is concluded that the civic consciousness of high school students in Russia is at an average level of development. The problems in the civil-patriotic education of schoolchildren are largely due to the contradictions in the holistic state policy on the formation of young Russians' civic consciousness.

DE China; Chinese economic miracle; capitalism; socialism; development
   model; discourse; discursive representation; narratives
AB It is unlikely that any other state attracts more attention of the world community than China; there are endless debates about its geopolitical status, social-economic potential, demographic challenges, environmental threats, political structure, etc. However, scientific and popular-science discourses focus rather on finding an answer to the question of what type of social system China has in terms of the classical dilemma of "capitalism vs socialism", and there are no universal nominations for either the historical past or present. The article aims at identifying the key discursive representations of the "Chinese economic miracle" by reconstructing them from three books recently translated into Russian: Zhang Yu's China's Economic Reform: Experience and Implications, Yifu Lin's Demystifying the Chinese Economy, and How China Became Capitalist, written by Ronald Coase and Ning Wang. The article summarizes the main arguments of the three books. Although their interpretations of the "Chinese economic miracle" differ, including the degree of the politicized enthusiasm and optimism, they agree that developing countries should follow the Chinese path of reforms and ignore a number of this path's serious problems. The article concludes that the books represent three discourses: an ideological-politicized scenario of developing a special type of socialism "from above", a description of the capitalist economy developed from both "above" and "below", and a statement of the completed transition to capitalism not under the party leadership control but mainly "from below" and, despite prohibitions and anti-capitalist rhetoric, "from above". Such discursive contradictions are especially interesting for the Russian reader who remembers disputes about the type of "Russian capitalism" in the 1990s-2000s, and for the sociologist of the "classical type", i.e., one studying historical changes to understand current social transformations.

AB The paper aims to study gender differences in self-representation and involvement in political communication in social networks. The author presents the results of the study of Facebook postings within a viral flashmob 'The Island of the '90's' devoted to a controversial period of Russia's modern history. The author offers the rationale for their attribution to an online segment of political communication. A multidisciplinary approach involving the combination of methodologies of discourse analysis and content analysis served as guidelines for the study. A discourse analysis based on the sociocognitive approach to political discourse helps identify three stages of the flashmob evolution in the three series of postings: private memories, political discussions of the 1990s, and attitudes towards the flashmob. These three series of postings form and organise a three-level structure of the flashmob. Each level is characterised by a different extent of its involvement in the political context. Comparative analysis of male and female participation in the flashmob reveals gender asymmetry in the flashmob discourse structure and at its structural levels. The results show that there are gender differences in political involvement of females and males in online discourse: women prefer less visible or less offensive patterns of political behaviour online. The results lead to the conclusion that, compared to men, women are more flexible in their self-representation and their participation in the discourse has less political involvement. No significant evidence indicating gender differences' disappearance was observed, and no evidence of gender role stereotypes weakening or disappearance in political communication on Facebook was obtained.

DE EU; common foreign policy; coronacrisis; Eurasian integration;

AB The European solidarity was challenged by the coronavirus pandemic both at institutional regulations and nation-state levels. The presented analysis is based on a review of the official speeches of the heads of European institutions and expert publications of leading European think-tanks and researches demonstrating that the geopolitical dimension of the EU foreign policy today is a new basis for intra-European consolidation in light of growing frustration about the global role of the US and China. The European foreign policy is nevertheless regarded as a new consensus within the integration alliance. Actually, the EU geopolitical role is an updated foundation for domestic consolidation, as it allows to push aside the contradictions on the value-based internal political development, which were clearly associated with the growth of nationalism, and to articulate the external conditions for political identity. The need for a stable consensus on foreign policy priorities creates the preconditions for the formation of new principles of relations with China, the emergence of Africa as a promising area for the application of the common foreign policy and a decrease of interest in integration projects in Eurasia.

AB Numerous scholars in the social sciences and humanities have speedily analysed and interpreted the COVID-19-induced social and political crisis. While the commitment to address an urgent topic is to be appreciated, this article suggests that the combination of confidence in the applicability of one's tools and belief in the certainty of the available knowledge can be counter-productive in the face of a phenomenon that in significant respects is unprecedented. Starting out from the plurality of forms of knowledge that are mobilized to analyse COVID-19 and its consequences as well as the lack of any clearly hegemonic knowledge, the article tries to understand how a limited convergence in the politico-medical responses to the crisis emerged, and speculates on what would have happened if this had not been the case. In conclusion, it is argued that this pandemic demands a greater awareness of the uncertainty of our knowledge and of the consequences of our actions, both in terms of being situated in time and of aiming at timeliness.

We discuss the political, economic, social, and historical processes that contribute to shape Russia; this helps to understand local activism and protest in contemporary Russia. Since this context is relevant to all the papers, the readers would benefit from reading this introduction first. The second part of this paper introduces the contribution that the special issue makes to the study of activism and politics, with papers analyzing different aspects and kinds of activism in a variety of circumstances and settings. A central question common to all papers is the problem of politicization which is treated at the intersection between social and political inequalities, the experience of everyday life and political imagination.

AB How and when are governments able to encourage firms and schools to work together to develop workers' skills? Upgrading the quality of human capital in the workforce is widely seen as a key challenge faced by countries looking to escape the "middle income trap." Growing attention has been paid to public-private partnerships (PPP) between individual firms and schools as a powerful tool for meeting this challenge, but key facilitators of PPP thought crucial in existing studies - strong, independent employers' associations and labor unions - are often missing in such settings. To explore the emergence of PPP in skill development in the developing world, we draw on recent reform experiences in Russia's regions that have led to a surge in complex, costly forms of PPP despite weakly developed business associations and unions. We argue that variation in the administrative capacity of regional governments and their political accountability explains this surge. Strong administrative capacity reassures all parties that regional authorities can monitor their counterparties' compliance with agreements, while political accountability creates incentives for authorities to do so. We test our argument using original data on the existence and content of firm-school partnerships across all Russia's regions for 2013.

AB The article is dedicated to the phenomenon of political neoliberalism, its genesis and evolution. The subject of the research is explored on the basis of methodology, which combines political philosophy, political theory and the theory of international relations. The author analyses the discourse of the "decline of Europe" and broader - of the West-centric world through the prism of modified forms of classical liberalism, their transformation from political theory to political ideology. The latter has morphed from the dynamic set of principles and values into its dogmatic version, which associates with most unpopular consequences of the neoliberal phase of globalization. Key elements of political neoliberalism's demise are shown including the strategic decupling of the US and its european allies. The author dwells upon a topic of militarization in thinking and foreign policy of many countries. He holds that degradation of political neoliberalism opens the way for a renewed balance between liberalism, conservatism and collectivism, including in the theory and practice of international relations.

DE Nikolaj Sieber; Marxism; Marx; Russia; future of capitalism
AB The Swiss-Russian economist Nikolaj Sieber was one of the first who wrote about Marx in Russia. In this article we reconstruct the development of his thought by mobilising evidence about the intellectual and political context he lived in. We document his involvement within the Ukrainian national movement of the 1870 s and argue that this closeness was consistent with his take on the capitalist evolution of the Russian Empire. We discuss his importance in the Russian debates on the future of the peasant commune and of Russia and conclude that his interpretation of Marx and capitalism was crucial for the development of the Russian social-democratic party.

AB The article focuses on the population's perception and understanding of their vulnerability to dangers, assessment of risks, threats and environmental security in the context of all these factors influence on political and social relations. The authors consider a number of issues related to the influence of social-demographic characteristics, political attitudes, level and quality of life on the perception of risks; identify social, institutional and political grounds of risk perception. The article aims at identifying the relationship between risk reflections of different social groups in the Russian society and practices of political participation. The article is based on the data of the all-Russian survey conducted in November 2019 with the support of the Resource Center of the Science Park of the Saint Petersburg State University "Sociological and Internet Studies". The authors show the attitude of Russians to real actual threats, their willingness to participate in mass protests and various forms of political action. Based on the analysis of z-values, the authors show a possible relationship between the structure of real threats and the willingness of social groups to participate in political actions, and also the impact of age, profession, and income on this relationship. The authors identified groups more inclined to nonconventional political action. Their potential protest is determined not only by dissatisfaction with the level and quality of life, but also by solidarity with other groups and the desire to improve the situation.

AB Decision-making mechanisms are becoming increasingly complex in the era of globalization, including more and more actors of different natures. The multilevel governance approach, as a promising analytical instrument that focuses on adapting decision-making processes to territories/sectors with multiple jurisdictions, has been recognized both due to its limitations in the explanatory power of normative integration theories as well as due to empirical studies of European integration. This approach provides better explanations for the strategies of political actors in the European Union in situations when the same actor uses different strategies at different institutional levels - supranational, national, and regional. Being autonomous, these levels are strategically interconnected: key actors take into account the consequences of interaction at all levels, but attach different priorities (weights) to the results of various "games". Depending on the opportunities for collaboration at various levels and the perceived relative importance of the achievable results at each level, such links between games can lead to strategies that may seem suboptimal to outsiders. In this article, we consider the strategies of the national governments of EU member states, studying the cases of external decision-making as well as cohesion policy using the multilevel governance approach.

   participation; political and social activity; self-sufficient;

ID RUSSIA
AB The social perturbations during the first half of 2020s demonstrated the contradictions that were accumulating in Russian society over recent years. One aspect of social disengagement is the peculiar attitude of different social groups and strata towards the long-term course of the contemporary government about maintaining stability; this term is understood as the pathway that preserves the misting political and economic system and "the rules of the game". Sociological data from monitoring studies by the Institute of Sociology of the FCTAS (RAS) demonstrates that Russian society is divided into approximately two equal parts: one wishes for change, and believes that the shortage of serious economic and social reforms will cause the state to stagnate; the other wants to maintain stability and believes that transformations should not be rushed, having no information about the results thereof. The reasons why public demands for change have formed have already been analyzed by the working group of the research project "Social Transformation of Russian Society. the Actors of the Request for Change,". Therefore, the author of this article focuses on the identification of the factors that influence subjective choice in favor of change or stability. The analysis demonstrates that such a choice is determined by political, not by social, differences between the supporters of either changes or of stability. These manifest, predominantly, when many Russians are aware that the bonier between private and public in modern Russia is illusory. The author, applying the sociological data, demonstrates the correlation between the increase of the number of "self-sufficient Russians" and the formation of a request for change. The combination of this attitude with a prospective vision of the future becomes a key factor that forces the desire for change. The social request for changes, which is not accepted by the authorities, forms a special identity that can transform the sense of resentment into a collective action to uphold one's vision of the future.

DT Article
DE Russian youth; state youth policy; forum campaign; regions; local
   communities; patriotic education
AB The article considers the document 'Foundations of the State Youth Policy' and its implementation in the Russian regions. This analysis allowed the authors to show that the document provides neither a political strategy nor effective management measures. The authors present the results of the analysis of the youth policy implemented by government agencies online - on the websites of regional administrations and in the social network VKontakte. The websites do not provide any current information, while the social network, on the contrary, is quite effective. The article describes the perception of the state youth policy by regions and local communities based on the empirical research conducted in 2018-2019 in 7 regions of the Russian Federation - the Tver, Kursk, Pskov, Astrakhan, Rostov, Moscow Regions and the Republic of Karelia. The main methods of data collection were in-depth interviews and focus groups (43 interviews and 26 focus groups). Respondents represented regional and municipal administrations, including departments of the youth policy, local enterprises - industrial, commercial, hotels, etc., health and education organizations, cultural institutions and youth groups. There were also focus groups with the youth: 3 groups with university students and 3 groups with students of special secondary institutions. The article shows inefficiency of the 'two poles' approach - when the state aims at supporting the talented youth and the most vulnerable groups (orphans, children from dysfunctional families, etc.). Such an approach excludes from the policy and public discourse the 'middle' youth that needs but lacks rather participation in the life of the country than financial support. Today only the 'forum campaign' is implemented, in which the youth are happy to participate, but this campaign cannot strengthen the youth's social role. Thus, there is still no system youth policy in Russia.

AB The ghettoisation of immigrant areas in Denmark is a lengthy and objective process of the emergence of ethno-religious 'parallel societies' in the state. Cultural and religious principles that are often at odds with the democratic values of Danish society guide the actions of ghetto residents. Danish social and political discourse pictures this ideological difference between the host society and Muslim immigrant minorities as a potential threat to Denmark's national security caused by a combination of political, social, and economic factors. The ensuing social disunity and violation of the country's territorial integrity take the problem to a regional and international level. Through analysing public speeches o f Danish social and political actors, this article reconstructs key stages in the development of parallel societies in Denmark. Another focus is official government strategies to prevent isolated immigrant areas from turning into ghettoes: the Government's Strategy against Ghettoisation (2004), Return of the Ghetto to Society: Confronting Parallel Societies in Denmark (2010), and One Denmark without Parallel Societies: No Ghettos in 2030 (2018). The escalation of the social conflict calls for the Danish authorities to take decisive action against the enclavisation of segregated immigrant communities. This study employs discourse analysis to evaluate the efficiency and identify the shortcomings of government action to integrate ethno-confessional minorities into society. Particular attention is paid to analysing public reaction to the criteria for identifying ghettoes as well as to annual publications of official ghetto lists.

AB The period that has passed since the official proclamation of the Russian 'pivot to the East' allows us to draw preliminary conclusions about its nature, achievements, problems, and prospects. At present, the qualitative differences between this current course and earlier stages of Russian foreign policy looking towards an eastern direction at can also be noted. In particular, it is worth noting the more structurally complex profile of the 'pivot to the East', due to the clear identification of several components at the junction of domestic and foreign policy, as well as the regional and global dimensions of the Russian foreign policy strategy. The first component regards political and economic interaction internationally, including the aggregated motives for searching for additional sources of economic growth and technology, and the search for alternative energy markets and political and economic alternatives which arose after 2014, under expanding sanctions by the US and the EU; Russia's key partners in Asia (China, India, the Republic of Korea, Southeast Asian states) refused to join anti-Russian sanctions, while Japan paid them only lip service. The second component regards internal political and institutional development, which is connected with the intention to reassess Russian Siberia and the Far East development against the background of external milieu's radical transformation and growing economic and demographic asymmetry between the European and Asian parts of Russia. The third component includes further development of the Greater Eurasia conceptual framework, which could have helped Russia to retain and ideally to raise its integrationist potential as one of the leading states in the international system, via institutionalized political and economic partnerships primarily with Asian states. While the first component's development is evident and can be subject to qualitative and quantitative assessment presented in this paper, the contours of the second and third are still in the making.

TI "A RADICAL TURN": THE REFORM OF THE SOVIET SYSTEM OF PUBLIC HEALTHCARE
SO QUAESTIO ROSSICA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE history of Stalinism; history of medicine; Soviet public healthcare;
   medical education
AB While analysing medical statistics from the Russian archives and the political speeches of medical administrators in the 1930s-1940s, the authors of this article discovered a tendency in the development of the healthcare system which was dramatically different from the post-revolutionary era. The reform was ideologically grounded and consistently conducted in the USSR. During this time, the healthcare system was restructured and expanded in order to treat patients in the state's economic and military interests, which forced doctors to care more about workers' ability to work and production costs than about people's health. For this reason, access to free medical care was severely limited for Soviet citizens, but the range of services provided to workers in leading industries was expanded (including the establishment of medical centres in factories, sanatoriums and resorts, day nurseries, etc.). During the prewar decade, the public healthcare system expanded in terms of the number of hospitals, doctors, and patient capacity while reducing the quality of medical care caused by poor training, poor hospital facilities, lack of medicines and instruments, low-quality catering, etc. The authors reach conclusions about this seeming concern about the development of the healthcare system, comparing statistical data, optimistic official reports and revelatory narrative evidence, political debates of medical managers, and the accusations of party leaders. It is established that during the Great Terror (1937), reform critics were repressed and the assessment of state policy prohibited. In the postwar years, the reform of the 1930s was concealed by medical historians inside a 'grand narrative' of the past, which described the achievements of the healthcare system as aimed at saving the Soviet people's lives and health. The only possible and universally accepted approach was a myth about a consistent policy and quality science-based medicine available to everyone. The authors maintain that discourse control over the circulation of historical evidence about prewar healthcare policy made it impossible for researchers to see the discrepancies between politicians' statements, which were based on selective statistics, and social realities.

AB The article describes the life and work of Vladimir Klavdievich Arsen'ev in the context of the development of settler colonial project in the Far East. The article argues that Arsen'ev, a military officer and a self-taught geographer and ethnographer, shared in a political ecology, which combined "defense" of native peoples and the nature of the Russian Far East with racialized views of Chinese and Korean immigrants. This political ecology, in particular, led Arsen'ev to take part in military operations designed to cleanse remote parts of the Ussuri region of the Chinese and to develop administrative proposals on the governance of native peoples, which foreshadowed Soviet projects.

ID PRODUCT MARKET COMPETITION; MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES; FLATTENING FIRM;

AB The paper studies evidence from Russian firms to explore whether the decentralization of firms can be successful under weak institutions. The paper distinguishes between two strategies for decentralization of firms in an environment with weak institutions: decentralization of decision-making authority to professionals hired through open competition (real decentralization) and decentralization to people hired through connections (cautious decentralization). The paper argues that real decentralization has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency of firms and therefore can have economic payoff for firms even under weak institutions. However, the higher the distortionary effect of corruption on fair market competition in an environment with weak institutions, the lower the firms' returns to being economically efficient. Therefore, the lower the returns to real decentralization, and, hence, the firms' willingness to really decentralize. The empirical analysis presented in the paper demonstrates that really decentralized Russian firms are, on average, more successful compared to other firms in a range of activities: they are more likely to invest, to bring to the market innovative products that are new to the Russian or global market, and to export. The gap between really decentralized and other firms in the probability of investment and introduction of new products to the market is very substantial under low or moderate levels of corruption. However, the gap shrinks as corruption grows and disappears under very high levels of corruption. Correspondingly, real decentralization is less popular in Russian regions with higher corruption.

TI THE GREEN DISCOURSE AS A TYPE OF NEW LEFT POPULISM

LA Russian
DT Article
DE environmentalism; ecologism; populism; greens; new left populism;
   European Union; Germany; France; Italy; COVID-19 pandemic; social and
   political consequences
AB The article is devoted to comparative political analysis of environmentalist political parties and movements in the member states of the European Union. The authors study European greens with reference to the new wave of left-wing populism that originated in 2010s, and analyze the main reasons for the growing influence of ecological and left-populist parties and movements in European societies. Case studies of a number of EU member states demonstrate close and multidimensional interdependence between the green and populist discourses. The authors outline the key factors that determine this interrelation and conclude that a general left-green discourse is emerging, based on a common commitment of the corresponding political parties and movements, as well as ecological non-governmental organizations, to a post-industrial, sotto-ecological approach to world development. Moreover, this discourse is influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, which dealt a huge blow to the global and most national economies and, most importantly, to vulnerable social groups. The current "corona crisis" will inevitably deepen the social inequality, which has always served as a breeding groundfor populism. The closest example is the rise of populist movements, such as Syriza (Greece) and Podemos (Spain) in the aftermath of the 2008 international financial crisis. The post-crisis reality is likely to be marked by an increasing demand for socially oriented ecologism, with the left green responding to this request. Therefore, one can expect a new wave of populism, exploiting the inability of many governments to provide effective response to the pandemic. This new wave is likely to be characterized by the convergence of ecosocial discourse with left-wing populist and even left-wing radical discourse driven by a common commitment to postcapitalism. The crisis is also likely to attract attention of wider segments of population to global problems, including social and ecological ones. This, in turn, is likely to give an impetus to new models of development, such as "responsible development", based on the orientation toward non-material production and consumption, intellectual and creative resources, and the use of nature friendly technologies.

AB The article explores the evolution of the EU Strategic Autonomy concept in the context of COVID-19 and the search by the EU for its global role in the modern system of changing international relations. The author underlines that the coronavirus pandemic accelerated transformation of Strategic Autonomy into a complex and flexible instrument, which covers practically all the EU foreign and internal policy priorities, starting from overcoming negative socio-economic impact of COVID-19 and securing the EU "health sovereignty", achieving autonomy in development of a new generation of IT technologies and artificial intelligence to effective defence, resolution of ecological and migration issues, modern crisis management in global and regional aspects. It is argued that the Strategic Autonomy is used by the EU as a powerful driver for strengthening political unity and solidarity of the EU, increasing effectiveness of political decision-making process and harmonization of coordination management inside the EU. Special attention is paid to the priorities and goals of the EU foreign policy's agenda for short-term and long-term perspectives. Some for cast is given concerning the strategic relations of the EU with China, Russia, USA and the UN system. Key aspects of the EU strategy on crisis regulation and international security are also described. The author envisages that in the long-term perspectives the EU continues to deepen strategic partnership with the UN in order to increase its influence on the UN system's institutional reforms in the spheres of international security, prevention of conflicts, economic resilience, development of democracy and human rights, protection of environment. The article also outlines the issue of the EU's international partner selection in light of the Strategic Autonomy and the volatile conditions of the modern system of international relations and rising competition for global influence among key world powers.

The annexation, which resulted in a political crisis in Russian-Ukrainian relations, is a setting which allows us to test if a bilateral political issue caused employee discrimination. We use a quasi-experimental approach to examine how the political crisis influenced participation in major sports leagues in Russia and Ukraine. The results show that the employment conditions significantly worsened since the Crimea crisis started.

AB This study analyzes the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's (DPRK-or North Korea) economic exchanges with Russia and the European Union (EU) from an institutional perspective. Trade statistics show that between 2000 and 2012, the DPRK conducted more trade with the EU than with Russia, its neighbor and former socialist ally. This observation provokes the following questions: In what way does the institutional environment in Russia and the EU impact on economic exchanges with the DPRK? Why have Russia's economic exchanges with the DPRK remained limited despite a common land border? Of particular interest is the cooperation between the Russian Far East (RFE) and North Korea. What does the institutional set-up in the RFE imply for business opportunities in North Korea? To examine the so far little researched role of the RFE, this study uses quantitative and qualitative data provided by the Russian Federal Customs Service and the district governments of Khabarovsk and Primorye. The findings show that political, legal, and normative factors as well as different business practices impact on economic exchanges with the DPRK in various ways.

AB In the 1990s and early 2000s, comparison of transition strategies of China versus those in Central and Eastern Europe raised controversies in the economic and political science literature. However, differences between China and the countries of the former Soviet bloc in their transition strategies resulted not necessarily from a deliberate political choice but from different initial conditions. Low-income and largely rural China, after its first radical step (de-collectivisation of agriculture in 1978), could move more gradually due to its under-industrialisation and retaining administrative control over the economy. The over-industrialised Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and former Soviet Union (FSU) countries where the previous command system of economic management spontaneously collapsed at the end of 1980s, did not have such an option. They had to conduct market-oriented reforms as quickly as they could, with all the associated economic and social pain. Regardless of speed and strategy of transition, almost all previously centrally-planned economies, including China, completed building basic foundations of a market system by the early 2000s although the quality of economic and political institutions and policies differ between the sub-regional groups and individual countries.

DE ethnicity; ethnicization; ethnopolitical mobilization; ethnic party;
   regionalist party; electoral behavior; ethnic voting
AB The article deals with the functioning of ethnic parties and the phenomenon of ethnic voting in contemporary political systems. Functions and possible typologies of ethnic movements and parties are analyzed in the constructivist framework. Special attention is paid to the conditions of an ethnic party creation and the overlapping of its discourse with the regionalist party family. Ethnic parties are defined as parties that consequently advocate interests of a particular ethnic group; ethnic voting is a type of electoral behavior that presupposes that votes are distributed according to the ethnic identification of voters. A party status is required for an ethnic group to legally advocate its interests in the national legislature. A voter's ethnic motivation may be manifested in the voting for an ethnic party, for a candidate that represents a particular ethnic group, for a non-ethnic party that claims its loyalty to a particular ethnic group, and also against parties and candidates that are considered undesirable for this ethnic group. "Ethnic" votes may be distributed amongst several parties or candidates and also accumulated by a single ruling ethnic parties' coalition. Different kinds of ethnic vote and its possible impact on the political system are analyzed, as well as possible variants of the ethnically motivated electoral behavior. The most relevant for ethnic voting are the following factors: presence of an ethnic party, fragmentation of the "ethnic" party field, localization of ethnic groups, salience of mobilized ethnicity in the entire political system, political opportunities for ethnic parties or candidates, as well as ideological stance of the non-ethnic parties that become an object of ethnic vote.

DE biological and food security; biotetrorism; new and especially dangerous

AB Agriculture is one of the backbone sectors of national economics and a factor of political stability in many countries. International organizations (IPPC, FAO) estimate that up to 40% of annual yield with the cost of about 88 bill. U.S. dollars is lost due to the pests and diseases. Thus, prevention of plant pathogen dissemination is an internationally important task that needs joint efforts of all countries. Globalization of agriculture and food trade, prohibition of toxic but wide-range efficient pesticides, development of organic farming, and global climate change result in increased spreading and harmfulness of plant pathogens in regions and on crops previously unaffected by them. There is an apprehension that plant pathogens can be targeted as biological weapons for political purposes or to achieve economic advantage in competition by criminal methods. 'Agra-terrorism" was defined as crime against agricultural business by application of harmful pests (pathogens) of plants and animals. Agricultural crops infection by pathogens is underrated by both mass-media and biosecurity experts. Agra-terrorist attack would not be psychological and ecological threat only, but a long-term destabilization of food security for large regions or a whole country. In the European Union and in North America countries, plant disease problems are solved in the framework of broad international projects in the field of biological safety. In the Russian Federation, creation of a high-tech national program of biological safety in agriculture is long overdue. Urgent comprehensive measures are needed to prevent possible biological threats, as well as appropriate methods to eliminate their consequences with minimal losses. Global warming on a world-wide scale might increase agricultural production and foods export of Russia and must be taken into account in bio-security system design for agro-production sector of economics. Research in the biosecurity field must develop new methods of remote sensing, molecular detection and diagnostics, neural networking expert systems capable to forecast potential risks of pests and pathogens; it must introduce new technologies or marker-assisted breeding and genomic edition for enhanced plant and animal resistance.

ID SOVIET; IDENTITY; HISTORY
AB Based on the distinction between three approaches to loneliness, and the development of the phenomenological and existential framework of loneliness studies, this article explores Russia's discourse of national loneliness on three levels: a) the level of the official discourse of the Russian government; b) the level of political and philosophical concepts; and c) the level of popular media and cinema (with a specific focus on a case-study of the post-Soviet Russian blockbuster film Brother and its sequel, Brother 2). In this article I concentrate on the particular experiences of loneliness and their interpretations in Russia after the fall of the USSR. The case of the fall of the USSR has shown that social and political exploitations of different forms of national loneliness can become the flip side of the doctrine of autonomy, equal individual rights and freedom from authoritarian rule. This should be considered and never disregarded within our analysis of the contours and new transformations of emerging hegemonic discourses, including the different forms of nationalism in Russia, and in a wider cross-cultural perspective.

AB The article is dedicated to the analysis of the EU potential to become a real power center in the global politics. No doubt, European Integration is the greatest project of all times. But it is also true that the European Union is currently experiencing the most difficult period in its entire history being under the pressure of several crises - consequences of the world economic and financial crisis, new risks of a global economic slowdown as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, migration crisis, troubled relations with the U.S., China and Russia, etc. The end of the East-West confrontation that removed the threat of a global conflict has resulted in the crisis of the Euro-Atlantic partnership, namely the growing gap between the USA and the EU in the security sector, the emergence of a new China with global ambitions, the rise of a self-assertive post-Soviet Russia and numerous regional actors - India, Japan, Turkey, Iran, Brazil and other. However, the modern polycentric world is strongly influenced by the evolving balance between two opposite trends - the trend towards multilateral cooperation on global challenges and the trend towards a new bipolarity. This new bipolarity is developing within the same capitalist system and can be defined as a growing split between the liberal and authoritarian capitalism. The former is most vividly represented by the European Union, USA and their allies, while the latter - by China and Russia. Strictly speaking, nowadays, the only full-fledged power center is the United States, whose economic and military potential guarantees its political influence in world affairs. China is approaching these standards. The European Union and Russia represent two opposite models. The EU is an economic power center while Russia is a military power center In order to become an influential power center capable to protect its integrationist model globally, the European Union needs to learn Realpolitik, rethink its previous idealistic approach towards the post-bipolar world and acquire strategic autonomy capabilities. Aside from this, the EU leadership should resolve numerous existential problems, beginning with the challenge of nationalism, which is fueled by the crisis of liberal democracy, and ending with the necessity to define future contours of the European construct. The COVID-19 pandemic has made adjustments to the existing post-bipolar world order and "Great Power" competition, having weakened two leaders of globalization - USA and China - and opened a new window of opportunity for EU.

AB The aim of investigation was the political caricature analysis as the satirical image of Russia, through its political rivals' view and its culturological interpretation in the context of the political situation having formed in the Far East at the edge of XIX-XX centuries. As visual image, the caricature displayed some characteristic features of the Russian Empire in Eastern Issue solution and became a specific milestone of its policy in the region.
   The source of the article were caricatures printed at the given time in numerous satirical publications in France, England, the USA, Japan. Examination of Eastern policy subjects' ludicrous forms gave to the authors the possibility to transform the language of ideas into that of images and to portray the situation with complicated interrelations between Russia and leading powers in the investigated chronological period. Defining caricature line logics the authors presented political image of Russia through world public opinion, caricatures being carefully examined.
   Thus, we came to the following conclusions:
   Russian successful expansion policy in the East (railways construction in Manchuria, bank system foundation as the means of financial influence, ice-free ports lease), thus safeguarding its own economic targets and strengthening the Eastern boarders, it was the reason of open enmity from its political rivals, aiming to get their piece of Chinese pie, this being the cause of Russian demonization through satirical means as well.
   The most popular satirical image of Russia happened to be the Bear, associated with this country in world community's opinion, this very animal was to be dressed by the whole world. Its changing visual pictures of the octopus and the Cossack in shaggy cap, nevertheless, did not alter the essence: Russia in the eyes of Europe and the USA remained the plunderer greedy for someone else's belongings.
   Direction of the image fully varied after Russo-Japenese war when Russia faced great losses in respect of its formally successful Eastern policy. In the political caricature terrible Russian Bear retreated before the Samurai's sword and transformed into the war loser.
   National aspect of the visualization in this case does not allow to speak about Russian portrait objectivity. But many sided investigation of political images created by caricaturists in many countries permit to imagine complete historical scenery and define Russia's role in its development and transformation.

AB In the context of electoral authoritarianism, political mobilization is likely to be a more reasonable explanation of cross-regional variations in voting for the party of power than the diversity of the regions' policy preferences. In the Russian Federation, the political machines which coordinate various activities aimed at mobilizing people to vote for United Russia demonstrate different degrees of effectiveness. This article examines the structural factors that facilitate machine politics focusing on ethnic networks. Although strong ethnic networks are more likely to arise if the members of an ethnic group live close to each other, and at the same time separately from other ethnic groups, so far researchers have neglected to consider the localization of ethnic groups within the territory of an administrative unit as a factor. In order to fill the gap, we have created an original geo-referenced dataset of the localization of non-Russian ethnic groups within every region of the Russian Federation, and developed special GIS (geographic information systems) techniques and tools to measure them in relation to the Russian population. This has made it possible to include the localization of ethnic groups as a variable in the study of cross-regional differences in voting for United Russia. Our analysis finds that the effect of non-Russians' share of the population on voting for UR increases significantly if non-Russian groups are at least partially geographically segregated from Russians within a region.

AB Resilience theory has been used to describe the "bounce back'' effect-asystem's ability to recover to its normal state after a shock. While this usually applies to systems whose survival is seen in a positive light (such as democracy), this article emphasizes the other, darker side of this phenomenon. I demonstrate how anti-corruption discourse can support certain practices that actually contribute to the resilience of corruption. By comparing the anti-corruption discourses of the Russian government and its political opposition, this article shows the interdependence and mutual reinforcement of two practices: (I) the pervasive resolution of everyday problems by corrupt methods and (II) focusing on the corruption of particular actors as the main obstacle to the development of the country and society. The effect of this interdependence is ambivalent, as both practices challenge corruption and contribute to its resilience. In effect, this becomes amode of government and I link the concept of resilience with the literature on governmentality to better illuminate the endurance of corruption in Russia despite sincere (and even well-intended) anti-corruption campaigns. This model of rethinking the resilience of corrupt practices with the special focus on anti-corruption rhetoric can be applied to other countries where corruption serves as a pivot of the social and economic system, as it does in Russia.

DT Article
DE Middle East; uncertainty; global and regional trends; regional actors;
   rivalry; new threats and challenges; socio-economic situation
AB The article deals with political, social and economic trends in the Middle East, with a special emphasis on the issue of uncertainty. This uncertainty which is not new for the international relations has been a permanent feature of the region for decades. Certain regional trends tend to acquire a global dimension. The traditional domination of a foreign policy agenda over domestic one in the Middle East countries can be easily discerned in the global powers' policies nowadays. A number of global trends either do not work in the Middle East, or turn into their opposite. Thus, the regionalism does not manifest itself in enhanced cooperation or integration. Paradoxically, the integrity of the region is accentuated by conflicts; the latter are getting easily and quickly internationalized with regional states and non-state actors becoming active players and beneficiaries. The revival of ideology is another example of regional trends that can contradict or precede global developments. While the role of ideologies has been downgrading at the global level, the issues of civilizational and political choice have been in the center of public discourse in the Middle East since the Arab Spring. A global renaissance of ideology inspired by the world crisis cannot be ruled out. Political developments in the Middle East are currently even less predictable than they were in the past. Regional states are facing traditional economic challenges, such as low growth rates, high external debt, budget deficits and a single-commodity export dependence, and at the same time new systemic factors, e.g. global warming and increasing water scarcity, along with such "black swans" as coronavirus and energy market meltdown. Currently, the problems that were prevalent mostly in the Middle East are spreading all over the world shaping global trends. Elements of de-regionalization, deepening inter-state rivalries, conflicts, poor governance, protests that have been characteristic for the Middle East scene can be found all over the world which is now also suffering from the growing uncertainty.

AB Just a few years after the global crisis, the purchasing power of people and the demand for cars decreased significantly again due to the general negative economic and political situation, the slowdown in the national economy and the weakening ruble. Despite this, foreign investors keep interest in the Russian market and continue to develop existing investment projects and invest in new ones. Since the products of foreign automakers account for 3/5 of all cars sold in Russia, the analysis of strategies transformation is especially relevant. The determining factors stimulating changes in the strategies of European car companies in Russia are the dynamics of market demand and government measures to regulate the industry. On the one hand, it stimulates companies to change strategies by themselves, on the other hand, it helps to adapt to the complicated business conditions. In the context of the recession in the Russian market, companies began to look for opportunities to export made in Russia products to other countries. First of all, this option is typical for companies that build their plants in Russia and produce cars with a fairly high level of localization, constantly increasing it, including through the production of engines (Renault and Volkswagen). At the same time, the state is also interested in increasing the volume of deliveries in the future; customs regulation may be mitigated. Increased exports will allow to load production capacities and avoid downtime of plants. Due to the new requirements for localization of production, other companies have to transform their strategies with respect to the Russian market even more radically: switch from importing products and contract assembly to building their own plants. This type of change in strategy is typical for BMW and Daimler, which produce high-class products. Moreover, in conditions of economic instability, the demand for these cars was characterized by a relatively greater degree of stability compared to economy-class cars.

AB The author considers politics of memory as a key component of identity politics promoted by the nation state and views social history museums representing memories of the recent past as key actors involved in national identity formation. A comparative analysis of a range of new exhibitions recently set up in European museums of 20th century history in countries with a story of empire, a postcolonial legacy and a fascist past reveals important common features in presenting difficult pasts. This includes resorting to narrative history and to individual memories, appealing to everyday life as a depositary of national memory and a reflection of national identity, and promoting the representation of a growing cultural diversity of contemporary societies. Common to new exhibition spaces is also the domination of visual means of representation over artifacts in line with attempts to promote an emotional dialogue with the individual visitor and to engage with various communities bearing different collective memories. Today, museums are actively involved in reconsidering difficult pasts and in looking for new possibilities to present contested memories. The study also reveals notable differences in the agenda and in the intensity of public discussion of difficult national pasts, in the level of political engagement of various actors and their commitment to promote identity politics focused on social cohesion and development. These differences reflect changes in political culture and political identity societies in Western Europe and Russia are currently undergoing. The research appeals to "new museology" and critical heritage studies and promotes a wide approach to understanding identity politics and a methodology of its critical assessment. Empirical data were collected by the author during her visits to leading West European and Russian social history museums and complemented by data available on museum websites.

AB As a result of the new personnel policy, which began in 2016, a significant renewal of the governor's corps took place in Russia. A whole galaxy of young regional leaders entered the political scene. Some of them are 30 to 40 years old. Based on the results of a political and psychological analysis of the updated governor's corps, the authors highlight aspects reflecting the new principles for selecting candidates for the post of the head of a region. Among them are: a stake on experience and competencies, education and applied knowledge, development of "soft skills" in the process of training managerial personnel. In other words, for the federal center, the regional leader of the new generation is a young, energetic, efficient, educated professional in his/her field. A person holding this post is required to be a crisis manager with extensive management experience. An important criterion today is the presence of emotional intelligence and the ability to be open with the population, but demanding with officials. In addition, the authors note that the system of relations between the federal center and the regions, which is based on the absence of their independence, leads to the "managerization" of the governor's corps. Such an approach can lead to the accumulation of negativity associated with the exclusion of old regional elites and the formation of alternative centers of influence. According to the methodology developed at the Department of Sociology and Psychology of Politics, Faculty of Political Science, Lomonosov Moscow State University, the authors analyzed the identities of individual representatives of the regional leaders of the new generation and identified their typical political and psychological characteristics. First of all, this is a desire for development, for results, a focus on achievements, high motivation and ambitiousness. The vast majority of young governors strictly maintain the political style of "administrator" set by the federal government and are also distinguished by extroversion and a fairly high level of domination. Such personal characteristics, ceteris paribus, can contribute to the solution of ambitious tasks and the implementation of large-scale projects if they arise. At the same time, the authors note that the overestimated self-esteem of regional leaders can cause underestimated reactivity to social incentives. Also the lack of a link between the motive of achievement and the motive of affiliation (focusing on results in combination with building relationships with colleagues and partners) can be interpreted as a conflict potential.

AB The development of mass society and emergence of new groups that actively claim their place in society and in the world have turned historical heritage into a valuable political resource. This, in turn, has paved the way for 'historical politics', which, along with twentieth-century events, tends to encompass layers of the past that go much further back in time.
   As a result, archaeologists find themselves confronted with some important issues. What is historical heritage? How is it understood today? What attracts public attention, and what leaves the public indifferent? Who has the right to historical heritage - archaeologists, the state, or society? What society?
   Here, we deal with complex issues of ethno-genesis and disputes over historical heritage, including unjustified claims for heritage that is someone else's. Such disputes may occur between states, ethnic groups, or archaeologists and local communities. Acute ethical issues necessarily follow: is this about preserving historical heritage after all or is this about stealing it from others as part of the colonial/postcolonial logic? In addition, it has now become clear that armed conflicts can threaten historical heritage: it can be looted, destructed, or completely destroyed in conflict-affected areas. Thus, ethics is increasingly coming to the fore in archaeology.

AB The article is devoted to the analysis of the transformation processes in the Visegrad countries that have occurred since their entry into the European Union. The author characterizes common economic results of Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic in relation to the European trends and positions of the main member states that allow to evaluate the results of the transformation processes in every member of the V4. The features of individual countries in the external trade sector, investment sector, financial stability and labour market are specified. The author describes the main reasons of economic development of the V4 among which inflows of FDI and developed foreign trade sector are identified. The TNCs' role in the economies of the Visegrad countries is analyzed including its influence on the economic structures of Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. The conclusion is made about a disproportionately developed secondary sector in the region compared to the EU due to the presence of foreign capital. Special attention is paid to the question of the dependence of the Visegrad countries on the EU, including the influence of financial flows from the European Union on their economic development. An assessment of revenues from the EU budget to the Visegrad countries and the positions of these countries in relation to other EU members is given. The reasons for the non-entry of Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic into the Eurozone are analyzed. Not only political motives, but also economic, social reasons of permanent shift of the euro adoption terms are considered. In general, the V4's fifteen-year period of participation in the EU can be called difficult, however, the countries managed to advance in further integration into the EU while maintaining the heterogeneity of economic results within the Visegrad Group itself.

DE Decembrists; Paez de la Cadena; St. Petersburg uprising; interregnum;

AB This article analyzes a set of dispatches related to the business correspondence of the Spanish Ambassador, Juan Miguel Paez de la Cadena, in St. Petersburg. The article gives an archaeographic description of the historical source of research into the problems of the history of the revolt of 1825. It further shows the peculiarity of the life of the metropolitan information field immediately after the death of Emperor Alexander I. This approach to studying the main plots of the history of the interregnum enables to highlight major problems concerning the Russian society and to pay special attention to the Polish question in this case. An analysis of the messages of the second half of December-early January demonstrates, on the one hand, the prevalence in the Russian ruling circles of the mythologem about the all-European conspiracy of secret societies, and, on the other hand, the nature of its transformation in the midst of a deep political crisis in the Russian Empire. The article shows how this concept and which of its elements acquire a new dimension and are reflected in the rhetoric of the young emperor and his entourage, and above all, K. V. Nesselrode. It is related to the problem of a priori definition of the key organizers of the rebellion. According to the renewed discourse, this role was assigned to the Poles and representatives of the titled aristocracy. It was them who, relying on the Spanish experience, intended to involve soldiers by deceit, commit violent acts against the tsar's family and sow anarchy and disorder.

TI MUSLIMS IN EUROPE: IDENTITY CRISIS BETWEEN "EUROPEAN" AND "ISLAMIC"

SO BALKAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY
LA English
DT Article
DE Globalization; integration; migration crisis; identity; "Islamic" and
   "European" values
AB A world in constant motion, in a state of migration turbulence, presents humanity with new challenges and risks. Globalization is a blessing or a tragedy for humanity, occasioning the problem of how to preserve one's identity, remaining "one's own among strangers" while, at the same time, not becoming "a stranger among one's own." Integration processes in the world today are met with resistance by multidirectional processes that encourage a critical engagement with all spheres of life in modern society in order to counteract forces of depersonalization and the disappearance of one's identity - one's self - as expressed in the preservation of one's ethnic group, culture, religion, and so on. This is especially evident in attempts at preserving identity within Muslim communities in European countries.
   Given the growing Muslim population in Europe, it has become obvious that "European" and "Islamic" values are opposed in the context of preserving one's own identity, which is increasingly manifested in a religious context. Europe today has become a hostage of its values, which are despised by many of the immigrants who have poured into its borders. These are tolerance, political correctness, multiculturalism, democracy, and freedom of speech, among others, which are perceived as weakness and indecision. Eastern mentality, habits, and traditions are sometimes very different from European ones. The author examines the transformation of Muslim identity and the compatibility of "European" and "Islamic" values. The article also presents the opinions of various researchers on this issue, and provides possible scenarios for the trajectory of events, given continued intercultural contact through immigration and given the stakes and state of this collision of values.

ID FUTURE
AB The article continues the discussion about the probable post-capitalist global future, the reflections on which are a necessary part of the Marxist discourse: both the critical analysis of modern capitalism and the building on the basis of this analysis of the general political strategy. The author rethinks the concept of Marx that between capitalism and communism lies a long era of revolutionary transition and shows that this era can no longer be thought of as a "dictatorship of the proletariat". It is shown that our ideas about the economic, technical and technological, political, socio-class, cultural, interpersonal and existential content of this transitional post-capitalist era directly depend on the specific historical level of development of real capitalism. Since modern capitalism is becoming more and more digital, communicative, post-industrial, cognitive, post-Fordist, Indigo-economy, and the key productive social group is the creative class (cognitariat, personaliat, socialiat), then our ideas about the near post-capitalist future are determined by this trend. However, from the author's point of view, many Marxists (with a general rather cautious prediction of the future) hastily and unreasonably extrapolate the growth of the creative class, the increase in free time and creative activity due to total robotization, not for the transition period, but for the "Kingdom of freedom" itself, for "communism".

DE forced migration; European Union; migration crisis; refugees; Visegrad
   Group; European Court of Justice; EU Migration Policy
ID IMMIGRATION
AB The article seeks to develop a nuanced understanding of the contradictory approaches EU political elites have taken regarding the problem of forced migration, which intensified as a result of the 2015 migration crisis. To do so, the authors analyze the content of judicial disputes between the European Commission and the Visegrad Group countries concerning refugee distribution quotas, identify the main disagreements among the major European political actors which developed as a result of their different approaches to forced migration, and demonstrate the current state of affairs in this sphere from the decision-making perspective. The authors provide an in-depth analysis of the legal arguments presented by these parties before the European Court of Justice, and come to a conclusion about the political nature of this conflict. Plaintiffs and defendants do not merely interpret the acquis communautaire differently - they have diametrically opposed views on the contents of the problem of forced migration. As for attitudes towards how refugees are received, the "power landscape" within the EU is determined by the confrontation between the liberal and conservative centers; the former is represented somewhat arbitrarily by Brussels (being home to the European Commission and the European Court of Justice), as well as by the leadership of Germany and Sweden, whereas the latter is composed of the governments of the Visegrad Group and Italy. Several states tend to lean toward one of these two sides. However, most EU member states do not hold an extreme position on the issue of refugees, preferring instead to fluctuate between these two principles. On the one hand, they are committed to humanistic values and pan-European solidarity; on the other hand, protecting national sovereignty and security is important to them. This contradiction manifests itself both in the vagueness of their leaders' public rhetoric and in the endless delay and half-hearted character of their decisions. Having analyzed the behavior and policies of these national governments over the past four years, the authors found that all major players within the EU are quite willing to compromise. This suggests that there is no threat of the EU collapsing under the pressure of the contradictions caused by migration.

ID COMPARE STATE CAPACITY; DIFFERENT COUNTRIES
AB In this article, we present the results of the development of the "Political Atlas of the Modem World" ("Atlas 1.0") project. "Atlas-1.0" was implemented more than ten years ago by scholars of the MGIMO University with the support of the Institute of Public Projects and the "Expert" magazine. Development of five complex indices of staleness, external and internal threats, the potential of international influence, the quality of life and the institutional foundations of democracy - was one of the major results of the "Atlas-1.0" project. The method of discriminant analysis was used to calculate the ratings of 191 UN member states (as well as Taiwan) as of 2005. The results obtained, reflecting various aspects of the existence of modern states, were compressed into four principal components. The four of them in the complex were interpreted as an analytical model of the modem world structure. In the project implemented ten years later at the Higher School of Economics with the support of a grant from the Russian Science Foundation ("Atlas 2.0"), the results obtained in the earlier atlas were tested for durability, corrections were made for the emergence of new UN member states, the components of the indices were refined, new statistical databases were used and advanced methods of multivariate statistical analysis were employed. The performed operations fit into the tradition of "revisited" which is part of the modem social sciences. A number of meaningful conclusions about the dynamics of the world structure have been made. The results obtained (configurations of the principal components) indicate the significant stability of the basic parameters of the world structure. At the same time, important elements of dynamics have also been revealed.

AB In this article the methodological discussions that took place in the historiography of the 20th century in connection with the creation of regional and national historical narratives are analyzed. In particular, the article shows how the concepts on regions were shaped, how their scientific conceptualization was substantiated. The main focus is on how ideas about Central Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia have evolved. The author of the article analyzes how the "regionalist challenges" are reflected in modern historical science, how the political elaboration of the past correlates with modern historiographic trends. The article concludes that one can hardly agree with the assumption that the regional framework of historical narrative by default creates problems for the national framework. According to the author, regional history is one of the most important and promising tools for historical projects that try to overcome the limitations of nationally oriented narrative. Nevertheless, methodological nationalism still prevails, and the crucial question of more complex and flexible categories in the historical conceptualization of space beyond nation-states is still in very early and preliminary stages of analysis.

AB The article substantiates the criteria for assessing the role of identity politics and the potential of identity policies in local community development. Identifying this potential is crucial for assessing the prospects of a paradigm shift in development policies in a changing world order. The emergence of new cleavages in contemporary societies - due to rapidly growing digital divides and disparities between territories - calls for a new development agenda for different levels of political governance. Attention to intangible resources and administrative priorities for the development of non-urban territories has been growing in political studies in recent years, particularly, in the context of "rural" studies across different regions of the world. As such, identity politics are considered an intangible resource, and include policies aimed at forming strong local identities to promote community development. This research is based on an empirical study conducted by the authors in Krasnodar Krai in 2019 (8 focus-group interviews and 40 expert interviews in 8 rural settlements). Drawing on empirical data several markers of rural local identity were detected and described, and an identity policy matrix relevant for local communities was constructed. The level of involvement by various actors and agencies in the development of rural territories, and the character of the development activities, were the main criteria applied to discern three types of identity policies which the authors describe as reactive, proactive, and active. Their potential in promoting the development of Russian rural territories was determined, taking into account the unique socio-cultural and natural-geographical landscape, the heterogeneity of the socio-economic and sociocultural space of Russian regions, and the variety of institutional models of local community agency present in contemporary rural Russia. The authors advocate the promotion of "rural" (non-urban) studies in political science in Russia.

AB The article presents the results of a political-psychological analysis of the young generation of Russian political elite, which has recently been undergoing a transformation. The author describes the main methodological instruments of empirical study, which include a structured interview, the psychobiographical method, content analysis of texts, and event-analysis. Using these methods, the author has collected and processed biographical information from 292 young politicians across various levels. An analysis made it possible to compose a typology of young politicians, based on their career path and life experience. The typologization of results shows that, most often, young people come into the political elite either through the party line, or from their main professional field through which they gain some visible traction. The exception is young high-ranking officials of the ministries, who are moving into elite positions through successive stages of service as officials. This distinguishes the young generation of politicians from the older one, who were recruited through business or public service. As part of the study, an analysis of the personality characteristics of young politicians was also carried out, which was based on a motivational profile, a self-concept, the style of interpersonal relations, and the style of political behavior. The article presents the generalized results of these psychological portraits along the aforementioned parameters. In conclusion, the author summarizes the finding about the state of the young generation of politicians, and provides an assessment of their personal potential and professional capabilities in modern political processes and public administration.

SO POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY
   OF POLITICS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE mobilization; coercion; collective actions; repression
ID REPRESSION
AB Despite the significant attention paid in Political Science to the problems of repression and state coercion there is still no general theory that would predict what types of coercion are used during mass protests. The "law of coercive responsiveness" and the theory of the "internal democratic peace" are insufficient to explain variations in the scale and content of coercive measures across different political regimes. To fill this gap, A.Semenov and E.Popkova turn to the analysis of the reaction of regional authorities to political mobilization in Russia and patterns of interaction between authorities and protesters using the evidence from Alexei Navalny's 2017-2018 presidential campaign. For the empirical analysis the study uses data on protests in 160 Russian cities.
   A study conducted by the authors confirms that Russia can be classified as a hybrid regime that usually gives pride of place to the informational control rather than coercive means. At the same time, the authors show that even under centralized conditions, the choice of a strategy for responding to mass mobilization depends not only on structural factors, but also on the attitudes of power holders. In particular, which specific combination of coercive measures to use is decided at the lower governmental levels rather than the federal one. Moreover, after each wave of mobilization, this strategy is modified to fit the changing conditions. The authorities and activists are constantly testing the limits of what is possible rather than searching for the only true strategy within the framework of a general equilibrium, and the equilibrium itself in most cases is temporary.

AB This paper focuses on the practices, assessment approaches, procedures, and applied aspects of competitive intelligence (CI). The study relies upon a survey of CI practitioners conducted in 2019 and a comparison of its results with a similar survey in 2006. It was found that companies spend the time devoted to this activity mainly on processes that go beyond collecting information, including planning, analysis, communications, and management. Most enterprises have official divisions and profile managers. The results are used to perform a variety of strategic and tactical tasks.
   The main sources of information are the Internet, company employees, customers, and industry experts. Compared to 2006, a new key resource has emerged - social networks. Of the analytical methods, SWOT analysis and the study of competitors are most often used. Several channels of communication are used simultaneously to disseminate the received information, mainly email and presentations are used. Key performance criteria are customer satisfaction and the number of decisions made based on the information gathered.
   A comparative analysis revealed that over the period separating the surveys of 2006 and 2019, the function of the CR has become more formalized. The share of companies with centralized divisions and CI managers has grown. Currently, this activity more often goes beyond the simple profiling and evaluation of competitors. Technology assessment, economic, and political analysis are more actively practiced.

TI THE DIPLOMATIC CEREMONIAL AT THE COURT OF CATHERINE II
SO QUAESTIO ROSSICA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Catherine II; European diplomacy; Russo-British relations; diplomatic
   ceremonial; Russian court; kissing hands in European history
AB Referring to relevant approaches to the study of diplomatic culture and the semiotics of gestures, this article examines the significance of kissing the sovereign's hands in diplomatic ceremonies in western Europe, and, more particularly, in Britain and Russia. Confusion and disagreement over the meaning of this gesture could become a major stumbling block in the evolution of Anglo-Russian relations at the very moment when there was a willingness to become closer owing to the expanding sphere of mutual political interests. With the arrival of the British ambassador Charles Cathcart and his wife in Russia in 1768, the ceremony of the first audience of the ambassador and (especially) the ambassadress with the sovereign was the subject of intense negotiations in the highest echelons of power. The discussion focused on the act of kissing the sovereign's hands. A gesture that in Russia had long been considered a sign of the monarch's mercy towards the ambassador of another Christian state might seem an acknowledgement of subordination or submission to the Scottish Lord Cathcart. The tradition had no parallel in the diplomatic ceremonies of other European courts. Why did the Russian government, which sought to match diplomatic ceremonies at the court with Western European protocols, not compromise when it came to this formality? How did the key persons of the story Cathcart and Count Nikita Panin - evaluate the possible consequences of not carrying out the required ceremonial protocols? What concessions and violations were the two sides prepared for in these disputes over ceremony in the name of "high politics"? Referring to archival materials from the National Archives of the United Kingdom, the personal papers of the Cathcart family kept in the National Library of Scotland, and several published dispatches of British representatives in Russia, the author studies the reflections of Lord and Lady Cathcart on their introduction to Empress Catherine II. The analysis leads the author to conclude that Catherine II perceived the kissing of the sovereign's hands as an indispensable prerequisite for starting any diplomatic mission and as a historically established gesture that demonstrated the grandeur of the crown. Negotiations over the act of hand-kissing in 1768 showed that this ceremonial detail was not a mere formality but could become the key factor in the success of an ambassador's mission.

LA English
DT Article
DE Region; security; NATO; war presence; military training; rotation;
   infrastructure; energy security; hybrid warfare
AB The fundamental geopolitical changes in the Baltic Sea region after the end of the Cold War caused the United States to revise its priorities in that part of the world. The process became especially apparent in the second decade of the 21st century when the Ukraine crisis brought to light the consequences of NATO and EU enlargement to the former Warsaw Treaty allies and the Baltic States. This article shows how the US, motivated by the need to 'contain' Russia, was developing its overall approaches to ensuring its political leadership in the Baltic region. It demonstrates how Washington is planning to reduce the vulnerability of certain nations of the region to Russia's military and nonmilitary influence and what steps the US and its NATO allies have taken in this direction. It is argued that, although the Western military buildup in the Baltic Sea region and the US attempts to neutralise Russian 'hybrid' instruments are unable to increase substantially the defence capabilities of NATO allies in the Baltic, the security dynamics in the region are likely to turn it into an arena for a struggle between Russia and the West. Russia will benefit from seeing the Baltic region nations not as tools in the Russian-US confrontation, but as partners in regional cooperation aware of their own interests.

SO SLOVENE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SLAVIC STUDIES
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Russian identity; nation; historiography; Peter the Great's cultural
   reform
AB The article analyzes the history of the concept of a "Slavic-Russian nation". The concept was first used by Zacharia Kopystenskij in 1624, but its wide occurrence starts in 1674, when Synopsis, the first printed history of Russia, was published in Kiev. In the book, "Slavic-Russian nation" refers to an ancient Slavic people, which preceded the "Russian nation" ("rossiyskiy narod") of the time in which the book was written. Uniting "Slavs" and "Russians" ("rossy") into one "Slavic-Russian nation", the author of Synopsis followed the idea which was proposed but not specifically defined by M. Stryjkovskij in his Chronicle (1582) and, later, by the Kievan intellectuals of the 1620s-30s. The construction of Synopsis was to prove that "Russians" ("rossy") were united by both the common Slavic origin and the Church Slavonic language used by the Orthodox Slavic peoples. According to Synopsis, they were also supposed to be united by the Muscovite tsar's authority and the Orthodox religion. The whole conception made Synopsis very popular in Russia in the late 17th century and later. Earlier in the 17th-century literature of the Muscovite State, some authors also proposed ethno-genetic constructions based on Stryjkovskij's Chronicle and other Renaissance historiography. Independently from the Kievan literature, the word "Slavic-Russian" was invented (first appearance in the Legend about Sloven and Rus, 1630s). Both the Kievan and Muscovite constructions of a mythical "Slavic-Russian nation" aimed at making an "imagined" ethno-cultural nation. They contributed to forming a new Russian imperial identity in the Petrine epoch. However, the concept of a "Slavic-Russian nation" was not in demand in the political discourse of the Petrine Empire. It was sporadically used in the historical works of the 18th century (largely due to the influence of Synopsis), but played no significant role in the proposed interpretations of Russian history.

ID HUMAN-RIGHTS; EMERGENCE; DETENTE; DEMISE
AB The article is devoted to one of the key subjects of the detente period the history of development and adoption of Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the Trade Act of 1974. The significance of the human rights problem in the USSR, in particular the right to emigrate, for the development of American-Soviet relations at the peak of detente is shown. Special attention was paid to trilateral negotiations between the Soviet leadership, Nixon and Ford administrations and the legislators headed by Senator Henry Jackson.The Amendment, adopted in December 1974, created serious obstacles for the development of trade and economic relations between the superpowers, and it had a number of negative political consequences also. The Amendment constituted the issue of human rights in the USSR as one of the important components of the U.S. foreign policy, created a negative background for the American-Soviet dialogue, which significantly complicated the outlined convergence of superpowers and contributed to the curtailment of detente.
   The political struggle around the Jackson-Vanik Amendment became the quintessence of detente. Each of the parties involved regarded the Amendment differently: Soviet leaders saw it as a rude interference in the internal affairs of the USSR; Kissinger saw it as an untimely and too radical in form and methods attempt to transform the Soviet system; Jackson saw it as a good way to increase his popularity by exploiting a popular in the post-Vietnam era theme that was naturally consistent with American national values and traditions. Both the Kremlin and Jackson had a fairly clear set of concessions that they could make. However, in the context of the systemic crisis of power caused by Watergate, the US administration did not have enough resources to bring them to a common denominator. The Soviet leadership soon also faced new economic and political challenges, and the problem of restoring trade relations with the United States ceased to be a priority.
   The Jackson-Vanik Amendment of 1974 became the watershed separating the "high detente" from its downward phase. Its real significance far exceeded its immediate meaning embedded in the arguments of its creators. It was not an accident that the Amendment was not canceled in 1987 after the USSR liberated its emigration policy. After the collapse of the USSR American leadership used it as a political leverage against Russian Federation. Boris Yeltsin appealed to Bill Clinton multiple times in 1993-1994 requesting removal of discrimination measures in trade and economic relations inherited from the soviet times. The Amendment was not cancelled it was only temporarily suspended. It was officially canceled only in 2012, but only in order to give way to a law that allows the United States, at its discretion, to impose sanctions on individuals allegedly responsible for human rights violations in Russia (the so-called Magnitsky Act) and remains an obstacle to the development of equal Russian-American economic ties.

The author also reveals fundamental differences in the understanding of history and its teaching by Muravyov and Zhukovsky. These differences significantly distinguish the educational program, pedagogical method and pathos of Zhukovsky's educational prose from that of Muravyov. Zhukovsky emphasizes the close relationship of history with religion and faith in God, which corrects all the instances of convergence discussed in the article without canceling them. The common revealed in Muravyov's and Zhukovsky's pedagogical prose on history certainly has the character of typological convergence determined by the atmosphere of the Russian society's spiritual search in the late 18th - first half of the 19th centuries. The intersections that have not yet attracted the attention of researchers explain in many ways the patterns of transition of Russian history, literature, and pedagogy from the Enlightenment to the era of romantic philosophy of history, romantic art, and, so to speak, romantic pedagogy and the prose of writers-educators this pedagogy generated. At the same time, the continuity of Muravyov's and Zhukovsky's pedagogical and historical-philosophical searches, as well as the artistic and aesthetic principles of their implementation in pedagogical prose, is also obvious. Zhukovsky was well acquainted with Muravyov's writings, teaching and public reputation, and with his creative heritage (he was engaged in the editorial preparation of the heritage for publication). It is possible to claim that both the personality of Muravyov as an educator and public figure, and his pedagogical and historical concepts and ways of expressing them in pedagogical prose had an impact on Zhukovsky. The convergence and divergence of the two writers and educators, Zhukovsky's (as Murovyov's successor) conscious preservation of a number of elements of educational and historical ideas embodied in Murovyov's educational works, and their quite logical update must be sought in the conceptual areas of understanding the general laws of history and searching for forms of expressing history in literature, including educational one that aims at not only transmitting facts and ideas, but also rendering an emotional impact on the student necessary for the effective educational process, in particular, in the student's work with educational books. The author's second article will analyze Muravyov's and Zhukovsky's educational materials on Russian and world history and the nature of their continuity.

DT Article
DE migration crisis; migration policy; European cities; interaction of
   authorities; urban politics; intercity connection
AB The article examines the urban dimension of cross-border migration to the EU countries and the role of cities in the political, economic and socio-cultural integration of labor migrants and refugees. Facing a sharp increase in migration flows, municipal administrations are forced to develop their own tools to tackle the migration challenges, which in some cases contradict the policies implemented at the national level. The main typological models of migration governance are considered. The key factors affecting urban approaches are identified, such as the nature and dynamics of migration flows, the distribution of competences between the central and local administrations, the balance of various actors in urban politics - municipal authorities, opposition parties and movements, civil society organizations. Particular attention is paid to the development of intercity cooperation in the field of migration, aimed at sharing experiences and best practices, providing mutual assistance in the resettlement of refugees, as well as joint lobbying of urban interests at the supranational level.

AB In the course of their transition to a market economy, the importance of international knowledge transfer from developed capitalist countries to the post-Soviet states has increased. However, the question of what particular knowledge has been transferred and why in some cases knowledge transfer has been successful, while in others it has failed, remains under-researched. Using gender mainstreaming as an example, the mechanisms of international knowledge transfer in Russian social policy are discussed in detail. The authors argue that specific knowledge transfer could facilitate the acquisition of new knowledge, but its sustainable application in social policy decision-making might be problematic, requiring commitment of political actors as well as supportive institutional conditions.

TI The Representation of the Concept "Road" in Oral Stories of Siberians
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE road; concept; Siberia; cross-border region; oral speech of Siberians;
   linguistic worldview
AB The article describes the concept "road" as represented in oral stories of Siberians. This investigation is part of a comprehensive, interdisciplinary study of Siberia as a cross-border area. The research materials are: texts of the Tomsk Dialect Corpus, which were recorded during dialectological expeditions from the 1940s to 2019 in the areas where old-timer Middle Ob region dialects are spoken; information from dialect dictionaries, memoirs and oral stories of eyewitnesses and witnesses of dekulakization and exile to the Narym region; materials of the project "Free and Non-Free Siberians" published on the website of the Tomsk Regional Museum of Local Lore. A concept is a unit of consciousness that is represented by means of a language. The article uses a modeling method that is implemented through the description of the nominative field of the concept "road", which includes both direct nominations of the concept itself and nominations of its individual cognitive features. Among the units that represent the concept "road", there are: the word road and its synonym way, their derivatives, as well as words that name roads in accordance with their various characteristics, words of different parts of speech and phrases that contain the seme "road": traffic, taxi, taxi driver, turnpike, country road, to go, to swim, to get lost, and many others. The contextual analysis of the material revealed that the following cognitive features receive language objectification: 1) the size of the road and its importance, 2) the use of roads depending on the time of year, 3) place of laying the road, 4) the kind of transport and method of travel, 5) the material from which the road is made, 5) the quality of the road 6) the direction of the road, 7) the road as an integral part of migration processes, 8) construction, laying and maintenance of roads, 9) the road as a factor in the formation of different social ties, communities and an additional reason for economic activity (crafts, entrepreneurship, etc.), 10) the road as an indicator of the development of Siberia, civilization and improvement, 11) the road as a dangerous place, 12) the road as a way of localization, 13) the road as an attribute of superstitions, rituals. Siberians' autobiographical stories and memoirs contain fragments that reflect the importance and significance of the road in human life. Facts from people's life connected with the road are: birth on the road, road to school/university/institute, wedding, work, moving, death. The road is a significant fragment of the Siberians' worldview; it reflects the spatial and temporal characteristics of people's lives, representing the "friend/foe" opposition. Formal (changes in road categories, obsolescence of expressions, new stable combinations and lexemes) and substantive (new roads, reinterpretation, de-ideologization of road spaces associated with the repressive policy of the state, etc.) transformations in the structure of the concept are due to time (change of epochs) and to political and economic factors.

AB On November 3, 2020, the experiment started with the election of 2016, which brought the alien to the White House, will end. D. Trump's nonconformism, political incorrectness, his playing out of the rules mirror a highly polarized process of the last decades. All four years of his Presidency, the ideologically divided political system has been trying to push this alien out not letting him make any radical changes. Trump survived, as well as the system. He followed Obama: in a polarized environment, he succeeded only with one element of his ambitious agenda - the tax reform, all the rest of his presidency he spent in battles. Democrats in Congress and on the streets are mad and angry about Trump as much as Republicans disliked Obama: during the four years, his approval rate among them was moving between 3% and 8%; in Congress, Democrats blocked all his initiatives and spent their time in principal but hopeless and useless try to impeach him. The federal government stopped functioning as one mechanism: Congress has been focusing on investigations, while the President has been changing personalities in his Administration and baking executive orders trying to cope with his agenda. The society has been boiling over on partisan line: Democrats alike their congressmen have been dreaming to kick out the alien President from the White House, while Republicans were stable in their loyalty to their President: 86% have supported him in all the ups and downs of his war with the Congress, Washington bureaucracy, media and liberals. In four years, it became obvious that the divided society being even more polarized now than in 2016 is starving for changes while the divided establishment is blocked in ideological radicalization unable to reach a compromise needed to respond to society. Whoever wins on November 3, Trump will stay in history not as an outsider, but as one more leader trapped in polarization that mirrored and fortified the ideological divide. The loop of the polarization brings the leaders to the political stage, who, being the face of the protest, are unable to challenge it with all their ambitious agendas drown in polarized Washington. Still the charge of the protest that they bring to the system speed up the transformation.

AB The article provides an analysis of the fallout of the external twin-shock caused by the coronavirus pandemic and a global economic downturn to economies and political environment of developing countries. It also looks into potential changes that are likely to take place in the current and future architecture of the world. On this basis, an attempt is made to envisage the vectors and results of the evolution of the less developed economies' place and role in a forthcoming new global normality. A study of developmental problems of this group of states is undertaken in the context of the ongoing globalization, fragmentation and sovereignization processes. The article considers the transformations taking place in and around developing countries from three key perspectives: a) the retrospect and perspective evolution of the globalization process; b) direct consequences of the pandemic and the global economic crisis for these countries' economic, social and political development; c) possible "post-coronavirus" development models, including the implementation of the responsible development concept and answers to challenges of the industrial revolution 4.0. The authors provide a segmented picture of the main areas of concern, or of political and economic action required, namely: medical and epidemiological consequences per se; an exorbitant narrowing of strategic prospects for sustainable development; the melt-down of favorable paradigms of the world order and mutually beneficial relations between members of the international community, which have been present through the last two decades. As a result of the analysis undertaken, the authors come to a conclusion that it would be a mistake to seek to restore the world economy by simply returning the constituent national economies to the pre-crisis state - the one that caused the crisis and the slump. In view of current realities, a paradigm shift is becoming an urgent need for non-Western nations. Even in less developed countries, it is wiser to start building the recovery growth around the core pillars of the industrial revolution 4.0 and of the responsible development.

DT Article
DE Spain; global crisis; welfare state; precariat; social movements of the
   new type; Indignados (movement of the indignant ones); parties;
   "Podemos"; trade unions
AB The present-day Spain, a country stricken by a host of unresolved issues and differences, is witnessing mass protests taking vivid and diverse shapes. These include both traditional ones - represented by political parties and trade unions - and modern ones, initiated by social networks. Analysis shows that during the global financial crisis and in its wake it is the new social movements that have mostly taken the lead in voicing the Spanish protest concerns, outshining political parties, especially left-wing ones, and trade unions. In these movements, a remarkable role is played by the precariat - a new stratum that grew fast during the crisis amidst increased social inequality in Spain. It consists of part-time and full-time workers, as well as people doing odd jobs, with no permanent employment. One distinct feature of the precariat consists in its unstable position on the labour market, lack of job security, and social vulnerability, all of which result in financial and psychological difficulties. According to various estimates, the Spanish precariat stands at around 26% of the working population (12 mln people). Faced with numerous problems, with lost hopes of a better future, these people are deeply distrustful of political institutions. Their response to the authorities' policies varies from a completely apathetic attitude to active participation in protest movements. To date, the social movements of the new type have already accomplished quite a lot, changing the public sentiment and making progress in certain areas. However, their clout is not enough to either depose the ruling elite or force it to accept a totally different political paradigm. Horizontally built, i.e. devoid of any leadership or rigid structure, these random movements are unable to replace the traditional parties or trade unions. Despite their criticism of the existing parties, the Spanish voters still cast their ballots. While complaining about trade unions, they do not discontinue their membership or at least enjoy the protection that the unions offer. Yet, competition against social movements within one electoral field creates a drain of the left-wing and trade union electorate, which leads to fragmentation in the left-wing camp. This competition is a strong factor encouraging traditional social and political organizations to review their own ideological and structural foundations. Slow as it may be, the transformation has already begun. Its progress is likely to map out what mass social protests will be like in the future and determine the balance of power between their main stakeholders.

DE Far-right contagion; radical right parties; radicalism; political
   extremism; Europe's political landscape
AB This article analyzed the rise of far-right political parties and movements in the most developed European countries - Germany, France, Sweden, Austria, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway as well as in the Visegrad Group. The current direction of the political and social development of those major European states shows great resemblance to the 1980s. The political framework is defined by escalating disappointment in social and governmental institutions, growing political fragmentation and increasing complexity of political communications. Under such circumstances radical right parties firmly secured their presence in the national parliaments and enhanced it over the last decade. Alongside their electoral success on the supranational level, it indicates significant alterations in the European political landscape. A new reality is being built while the right radicalism strives to demarginalize itself with its high adaptivity to the essential political institutions. The article analyzed causes and consequences of the ongoing changes. It suggested a new angle to assess the present radical right's policy effects. Proceeding from the neo-institutional approach it provided an insight into the key assumptions of radical right, far-right contagion and institutional isomorphism, while outlining the electoral dynamics and distribution of the radical right parties and assembling the concepts of their classification.

AB In the article, the image of the future is examined as a symbolic form for political communication and is associated with the constructive activities of the authorities to represent the future. Therefore, the image appears in a conceptual form, being the bearer of meaning. The main semantic context is culture, and the language of political culture creates a form of understanding, while the main linguistic means is text. In terms of producing texts and meaningful messages, culture is constructive. The authors interpret the image of the future as such a text. Construction is based on a modeling method where the cultural model serves as a program. So, a text message about the future constructs the reality of the future and we "read" this text in the language of images. In political culture, the text of the future shows its projective character, and the future appears to the imagination as a universally valid goal. When juxtaposing times in the semiotic way, the first place is taken by the present, where all images are signified. The image of the future is given only in the categories of apperception; this is an indubitable construct, idealized and close to the imaginary world. Since the future exists in the modus of probability and in the casus of opportunity, it is, in fact, virtual. In the present, the future is encoded in language. If the "writer" of the text is usually a futurologist, a social scientist, or a political visionary, then the "reader" is the "collective personality". This is how the image of the future, representing the mental trend of the present (connected with the past), is formed. Actually, people believe in the "code", "knowledge", which is transmitted through political communication. The main model of a politically controlled future is the "chaos - cosmos" mythology, according to which a new world is being proclaimed. The medieval foresight of the future was based on the idea of predestination. In the modern period, with its value of the "new", the idea of determinism dominated, which is paid special attention to in the article. In view of this, the concepts "new" and "future" are distinguished. It is concluded that political power used the symbolism of the "new" to shift the emphasis from the problems of the present to a prosperous future and thus drew its foundation from it (Zygmunt Bauman). Both Mikhail Bakhtin and Zygmunt Bauman came to the same conclusion: control over the future legitimizes power in the present. But the nature of capitalism and the class character in the distribution of its symbolic awards led to the materialization of two projects of the future: "Soviet" and "informational". Two modes of penetration of the future into the present arose: the purchase of its material attributes and the preparation of special political optics for its identification. In the era of postmodernity, under the conditions of the deconstruction of the image of the future, the symbolic activity of the authorities in modeling the future almost came to naught.

Kiparisov as the chairman of the State Academy of History of Material Culture have been frequently mentioned in academic publications on related subjects, as well as in the general context of the history of the Academy in the 1920s and 1930s. However, a detailed biography, reconstructed on the basis of a complex of previously unknown archive documents, has not been attempted so far. The materials from the Central State Archive of Historical and Political Documents of St. Petersburg, the Archive of the Federal Security Service in St. Petersburg, and information obtained from the descendants of F.V. Kiparisov, allow a new account of his life and academic career, and provide important information for understanding the history of the development of the Academy in 1934-1936.

AB The current relations between the United States and China, which are largely defined by the phrasetrade war,are analyzed. The authors place an emphasis on the economic, political, and legal aspects of these relations and the direct and indirect consequences of the trade war for both its participants and the world community. Attention is focused on the first months of 2020, when, in particular, a trade and economic agreement was signed between the parties. Individual sections of the agreement are considered, including those related to intellectual property; the promotion of American medicines to the Chinese market; and China's obligations to purchase American manufactured goods, agricultural products, and fuels. A brief excursion into the history of the trade war is undertaken, the position of the parties is shown, and key problems of the dialogue are identified. New factors affecting this dialogue are considered: the recession that has begun in the global economy and the emergence and spread of the coronavirus epidemic. The actions of the parties to respond to the new challenges are evaluated.

DE global economic slowdown; Latin America; socio-economic stagnation; "the
   elephant curve"; middle class situation; mass protests; COVID-19 effect
AB The world is showing signs of geopolitical and geo-economical imbalance, which threatens the international community with new crisis shocks. This is indicated by a slowdown in the growth of the world economy and trade, neo-protectionism and increasing sanction measures, financial "hand-wringing" of "undesirable" regimes, the incessant military actions in Syria, the "frozen", but with that not less the destructive conflict in Ukraine, and many other dangerous phenomena of international life. More recently, they have been joined by another "black swan" - the unexpected event that could critically complicate the economic and political environment, both in individual countries and globally. This is certainly the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19), the various negative effects of which have yet to be fully assessed. But one thing is already clear: coronavirus will have a negative impact on the world economy, "push" its reversal to the next global crisis and, as a result, the deterioration of the social situation. Similarly, the powerful wave of mass sociopolitical protests that swept the world (including a number of Latin American states) requires its comprehensive analysis and reflection. In this case, it is necessary to consider this phenomenon in two dimensions: a) the main causes and country features of protests; b) the conditioning of protests by the mega trends of global development, their connection with the fundamental processes that are changing the world order, formed in the age of neoliberal globalization. This dual task is even more relevant, because, according to experts of the consulting company Eurasia Group, in 2020, new protests, particularly in Latin America, can become one of the main global risks. The facts show that the main reason for the protests in the region has been a growing public discontent with the deepening income gap between the ruling class and the vast majority of the population, rampant corruption, the inability of authorities to resolve accumulated socio-economic problems for the greater public good and overcome the stagnation in which Latin American states live.

AB This paper analyzes the process of renegotiation of the informal contract between the regional and federal elites of Russia after the economic crisis. We use the database of Center of Public Procedures' "Business against Corruption" to show that, after 2011, regional elites in Russia lost the pre-existing opportunity to extract rents from businesses in return for favorable election results for Vladimir Putin and United Russia. We also analyze the connection between the level of corporate raiding in various Russian regions and the political competition, tenure, and ties of their governors. We show that there are two distinct models for fighting raiding in a region: an authoritarian model for suppressing negative signals and a competitive model with the creation of a new consensus among the elites. Although both models are similar in terms of the absence of negative signals, they have very different consequences in the business context of an area.

DT Article
DE identity politics; nation identity; identity-making; identity policy
   models; state identity policy
AB This article addresses some of the gaps in the contemporary study of the potential of the state in identity construction. In the contemporary literature, there is a tendency to treat nation identity as an independent variable, as the explanans, and the state as a dependent variable, as the explanandum. To provide an alternative viewpoint, this article develops an approach for the state as a system of preconditions that institutionalize the process of identity construction. The article proposes a solution to a number of theoretical issues regarding the participation of the government and state institutions in identity politics. The main stages of institutionalization of the state identity policy are considered. The structural components of the state identity policy are identified. The Russian model of the state identity policy is characterized. The article discusses the issues of determining the effectiveness of the state in the formation of identity. Making cross-case generalizations, the article first outlines the limitations of the state in national identity-making. It is not too much of an exaggeration to state that identity-making has been studied only through the lens of activities of individual actors, predominantly using the rational choice theory. In his approach, the author does not reduce the role of the state in identity-making to activities of government officials, but considers the role of the state as a full network of state institutions. The modern form of institutionalism allows analyzing the factors and consequences of attempts to pursue a policy of identity-making, when the existing state institutions produce 'perverse effects'. The article seeks to shift attention away from individual actors in identity-making toward the role of state institutions and objectivist factors. This multi-approach study of the role of the state in identity-making offers a promising framework to analyze identity-making in a systematic way.

DE ethics of science; history of science; scientific community; science as

AB The article focuses on the problem of building a consistent ethics of science, capable to ensure the solidarity of the scientific community, on the one hand, and the critical thinking of the scientist in search for new true knowledge, on the other. The lack of pragmatic legitimization of science goes hand in hand with the indistinguishability of the reliable basis for scientific vocation, with the difficulty of rational articulation of moral and epistemic intuitions. This cannot be facilitated by the modem myth of science, which has the features of rationalistic technocracism. The intemal and extemal history of science as a profession provides no explanation or justification for scientific vocation as an embodiment of an existential choice. The latter is understood only as a prehistoric, residual phenomenon similar to a sacrifice or a ritual gift. Recognized at the basis of all initial exchanges, the gift demonstrates its ambivalent character in science. It ensures the existence of science as a public good, which is also a heavy burden for those who are unable to follow its moral example. Both the intrascientific and external ethics of science are thus a challenge for the scientific community and society as a whole.

AB The article analyzes the weak points of the Manifesto Project's methodology, such as its emphasis on issue salience, instead of issue positions; bringing the content of manifestos under too broad categories formulated at the beginning of the project; not quite the appropriate technique of factor analysis etc. An alternative methodology is proposed that focuses on party positions on issues which generate the largest polarization in the political space. It also enriches the empirical base of the studies and adjusts the technique of factor analysis. In order to reveal political cleavages inside these dimensions, the so called electoral cleavages (factors of territorial differences in voting for various parties) are taken as a starting point: factor loadings of parties in the electoral and political spaces are compared through correlation and regression analyses. The proposed methodology is applied to an analysis of election results in Russia (2016) and Germany (2017).

AB This article provides a comparative analysis of the legal grounds for the deployment of the Russian Armed Forces in a series of conflicts in the Caucasus, namely in the disengagement between North Ossetia and Ingushetia (1992-1994), South Ossetia/Georgia (1992-2008), Abkhazia/Georgia (1994-2008), and in the Russian-Georgian War of 2008. The difficulties in codifying certain actions from the point of view of international law are detailed. The article discusses whether the political and military actions of Moscow in various Caucasian conflicts were driven and interconnected by one and the same logic, or were purely ad hoc fixes. Cases where Russia's actions have been legitimized by securing mandate from a regional intergovernmental organization are differentiated from cases where it has acted on the basis of intergovernmental agreements, as well as from the application in certain cases of Article 51 ("the right of individual or collective self-defence") of the UN Charter. The legitimacy or illegitimacy of the deployment of the Russian Armed Forces abroad is considered in the context of, and in comparison with, a series of cases where force has been used in conflicts by coalitions under a UN mandate, as well as by NATO and some Western powers.

AB The article is devoted to the analysis of the new youth environmental movement "Fridays For Future", which demonstrated significant success during the past year. The history of its formation is traced, and the factors due to which it managed to get rapid development for a very short time are considered. In particular, the reasons why its leader - Swedish schoolgirl Greta Thunberg - was widely recognized in the world and was able to convey her demands to both the general public and a high-ranking political audience are analyzed. The article summarizes the data on the movement and its leader, published mainly in the media, since the phenomenon has not yet received a deep scientific study. On the basis of media materials, conclusions are drawn about the factors that affect the positive or negative assessment of the youth movement and its participants. The main reasons why the media demonstrate significant interest in this topic are listed. The reaction of "traditional" social activists, politicians and ordinary citizens to the "Fridays For Future" phenomenon is studied. Examples of condemnation and rejection, as well as individual attempts to flirt with this audience, the desire to take a new force into circulation, are tracked. The author analyzes the viewpoints of some observers who express suspicions about the artificiality of this project and selfish machinations of adults allegedly standing behind the participants of the movement. How fair these accusations can be, and how right the apologists of the school movement as an honest children's initiative are - this is a complex question that requires the study of a huge array of information. Possibilities of influence of school strikes on the real political agenda are also considered. Some examples of initiatives, particularly in Germany, proposed under the influence of eco-activists, are provided.

AB The article analyzes the tendencies and perspectives of the global climate problem solution in light of the United States' withdrawal from the 2015 Paris Agreement. The acuteness of the global warming problem is demonstrated by constantly increasing greenhouse emission rates, especially in world's largest economies, which directly affects the climate change. The author traces the timeline of the global climate regime formation under the United Nations, with the Paris Agreement as its latest and the most progressive element. In this context, the more politically fringe looks the decision declared by the U.S. President Donald Trump in June 2017 to completely withdraw from the Agreement from purely economic considerations. The reasons and motives of the withdrawal are thoroughly investigated, conclusions are drawn regarding the effect this step would have on the United States' own environmental perspective, its leadership position in world politics, and especially on the international environmental cooperation in the fight against global warming. As most politicians and experts agree, while Washington will undoubtedly benefit economically in the short term, this action will have severe long-term consequences. On the one hand, being one of the most serious polluters in the world scale, the U.S. will be thrown back in the matter of air protection, which would affect environmental situation not only on the American continent, but worldwide. On the other hand, Washington's denial of its international financial obligations enshrined in the Paris Agreement and other UN documents will cause a drastic shortage in financing of the according international programs (especially in developing countries). The decision declared by D. Trump arouse big opposition both inside the country and abroad, drew strong criticism from world political leaders (including partner countries). Eventually, the United States run the risk of becoming an outsider in the international environmental cooperation (which will continue at any rate) and facing greater environmental challenges in foreseeable future.

DE museum science; scientific concept of the museum; Alexandria Museyon;
   museys and museums of European states and Russia
AB This article is devoted to the poorly studied question of the scientific concept of museum. The authors of the article collected and analyzed many historical and historiographical sources, and studied the etymology of the word museum. They found out that this term goes back to the Greek word , which means art, poetry, as well as education, scholarship, science. So this word was used in calling ancient Greece goddesses-patrons of art. (After all, there was a tradition to name museums as Temples of Muses.) At the same time the center of science and art, established in the 3rd century BC in Alexandria, was called as Alexandria Museyon. It became a prototype of all other museums. The traditions of collecting and using natural and cultural monuments in Alexandria Museyon have been preserved in Constantinople and other cultural and religious centers of the Byzantine Empire. The authors of the article suppose that manuscripts in Greek, the memory of museyon and the very term musey became the property of Russian culture in Middle Ages. During the Renaissance monuments of Byzantine culture spread across European cities, and aroused interest in antiquity and created the basis of collecting. During the 16-18th centuries, a variety of European collections were increasingly marked by the Latin word museum, which came from the Greek word mu..sa. For a long time the terms musey and museum were used in Russia almost on equal terms. However, in the second half of the 19th century, the repositories of monuments began to be designated as musey. It was a time, when Russian museum scientists began to develop the scientific concept of the museum. In 1892 the first successful experience of that study took Dmitry Klements. He proposed to consider the museum as a systematic collection of monuments suitable for the study of nature and history, as well as for the education of the population. Some years later Nikolai Mogilyansky claimed, that the museums had an important role in collecting, storing and scientific research of nature and history monuments, as well as in the promotion of knowledge.
   In 1930 trying to subdue the museums to the decision of state political tasks, narkom (minister) of education of Soviet Russia A.S. Bubnov demanded to put museums at the service of the proletariat class struggle, to use them in the promotion to socialism. In 1950s Soviet museum scholars returned to the interpretation of the museum as a scientific and educational institution developed by their predecessors. There was only difference: the scientific and educational activities of the museum were strongly associated with the construction of communism.
   Only at the turn of two centuries, an opportunity for a new non-ideological definition of the museum took place. The scientific concept of the museum reflects the historicity of the museum phenomenon, characterizes their functions that determine the structure and directions of museum activity to document the environment. The authors of the article emphasize that the new definition excludes the interpretation of the museum as a temple of muses, but reveals the role of the museum in actualization of cultural heritage. Thus, the modern concept of the museum became the key in the study and development of museum science.

AB In this forum, we reflect on the genesis and history of the Tver' Center for Women's History and Gender Studies-its inspiration and the qualities that have enabled it to flourish and survive the political changes of the last twenty years, as well as the unique project of women educating women it represents. Inspired by historical feminist forebears, it remains a hub of intergenerational connection, inspiring young women via exposure to lost histories of women's struggle for emancipation during the prerevolutionary and socialist periods, as well as the recent postsocialist past. Using an ethnographic account of the center's twentieth anniversary conference as a starting point, we discuss some of its most salient and distinguishing features, as well as the unique educational project it represents and undertakes: the center's origins in exchange and mutual feminist enlightenment; its historical orientation (women educating [wo]men in emancipation history); and its commitment to the postsocialist feminist "East-West" exchange.

DE innovations; defense enterprises; national branding; quality of life
AB The article is devoted to the study of the impact of the innovative potential of the defense industry and the innovative environment it forms on the quality of life of the population. It is determined that the search for the basis for the implementation of the Russian Federation national and territorial branding strategy should be based on the historical experience, sociopolitical and economic features of development and the cultural code of Russian society. In order to preserve scientific and technological sovereignty, maintain global competitiveness and, ultimately, improve the quality of life of Russian citizens, it is necessary to implement the main measures of innovation policy in strategically important sectors of Russian industry. The political and cultural dimension of innovation has a significant impact on the formation of the national branding strategy, on the understanding of modernization as one of the components of Russian national identity and innovation development formation as a national idea. The implementation of the innovation policy by innovative enterprises and universities as key subjects of national branding and the diffusion of innovations into social and political spheres contribute to the formation of a national brand. The identity of the Russian national brand is defined as innovations in the military-industrial complex as a basis for ensuring national security and defense capability, a qualitative catalyst for the development of industry through the use of dual technologies, natural strengthening of Russia's geopolitical position in the international community and strengthening of patriotism among the population, increasing of confidence in the government and its legitimacy and reducing of transaction costs of political governance. In addition to meeting the basic needs of society to ensure national security and defense, the national defense industry is an important actor in the formation of an innovative environment, which, ultimately, in the medium and long term, will ensure the growth of indicators of the quality of people's life. It is concluded that the developed sectoral competencies of the Russian military-industrial complex, breakthrough innovative projects, and the production of competitive high-tech products constitute the subject field of national branding and, with effective communication representation, can form a sustainable national brand in order to increase the symbolic capital, expand Russia's political influence in the world, unite the nation on the basis of national values, improve the quality of life of the population.

DE globalization; protectionism; USA; China; international trade; trade
   policy; national security; economic nationalism
AB The Trump administration's trade war for sole leadership is destroying the 70-plus-year reputation of the United States as the chief architect and founder of the liberal postwar order. The Trump administration's use of tarif-restricting import measures to create greenhouse conditions for U.S. companies and even to generate political dividends during the election campaign has reached undue proportions. The willingness to "aggressively enforce" U.S. trade laws, to reduce the trade deficit and excessive national security requirements are widely used as a pretext for punitive measures aimed at causing the maximum possible economic damage to competitors. To justify this position, the thesis is used of the need to "make America great again", to restore "fair and equal" conditions of competition and to force competitors to "stop receiving benefits" at the expense of the United States. Trump sees the trade deficit as proof that other countries are pursuing discriminatory policies against U.S. companies. As grounds for imposing or increasing duties against imports from other countries, such reasons are used as: ensuring national security, leveling the trade balance, protecting the intellectual property rights of American citizens and corporations and even other countries' non-compliance with immigration rules. At the same time, any retaliation by trading partners is considered to be unlawful and is used as an excuse for further escalation. Some U.S. protectionist measures run counter to WTO rules, damage multilateral trade system, disrupt global supply chains, slow economic growth, while damaging competitiveness of the United States. It is unlikely that the Trump administration's penchant for protectionism will diminish before the new presidential election. There are also fears that the position of the administration that will replace the incumbent will not be very different. The further escalation of the trade war may also lead to Russia's involvement in the conflict. Against this negative backdrop, it remains to be hoped that the majority of WTO members will continue to operate within the rules of the organization and that relations between trading partners will gradually be restored on the basis of mutual benefit and respect for sovereignty.

DE Homo oeconomicus; methodology of economics; rational choice; behavioral
   economics
AB The paper traces the historical roots of the concept "economic man", and reveals the main methodological characteristics of the rational choice model, which traditionally constituted the "hard core" of the economic approach to human behavior. The phrase Homo oeconomicus was coined in Great Britain at the end of the 19th century by critics of political economy in order to fix at the terminological level the apparent unrealisticness of the ideas the latter had developed about human being and human behavior. However, economists quickly appropriated this concept, making it neutral and starting to use it for their own analytical purposes. At the same time, they understood from the very beginning that it was nothing more than an abstract conceptual scheme, incapable of claiming descriptive realism. Accordingly, its criticism by sociologists, anthropologists and psychologists most often turned out to be untenable due to their erroneous confusion of the concepts of "analytical construct" and "anthropological type". Next, the paper highlights the transformation of modern economics from a mono-paradigmatic into a multi-paradigmatic discipline, and the emergence within it of numerous competing models of man. In this context, several incarnations of Homo oeconomicus are discussed: the traditional ("narrow") version; the extended (Beckerian) version; behavioral economics; neuroeconomics; and genoeconomics. The paper also provides a comparative analysis of different perceptions of man intrinsic to economics and sister social sciences. The author concludes that, in its modified and truncated form, the conventional Homo oeconomicus remains a reference point even for the latest studies in economics and psychology, where it is subject to various deconstructions.

DE culture; political socialization; knowledge; media environment
AB The culture of a society in political socialization acts as a mobile many-sided symbolical access to the understanding and recognition of borders of senses and values, of possibilities of reproductions of a political culture, as a way of interrelation of representations about prestate and state organisations of a society and power relations that transmits their senses and forms from the prestate, daily spheres of interactions of individuals to the state ones. Culture expresses the diverse social cogito as abilities of a society to self-reproduction in time, to solidary historical creativity, to the choice of a way of life and evolution. The culture of a society in political socialization as an expression of the social cogito allows political culture and the state to "take care of themselves", to "manage themselves", to "transform themselves", to "check themselves", to introduce new possibilities, to adapt for the changing environment of evolution, to collect new symbolical forms. In this context, the culture of a society makes the choice and connection of forms of power relations in the society. The forms have both closed (for access to new information) and open character that determines the understanding of various representations about political culture, its events. The close and open understandings of political culture coexist due to the cultural complexes of indistinct, poorly defined representations about the orientation of power relations, as well as to the culture-specific knowledge of roles, including in modern education. Modern media technologies become an active intermediary in the given processes. They expand the variety and speed of influence of evolution and conditions of the social cogito on the understanding of political culture. Media technologies allow to quickly transform people's vital world, their ability to judge about political culture, select political information; to include in the understanding of political phenomena different sources of representations about the political world, its values, ways of political participation in the course of political socialization.

DT Article
DE Lenin's image; revolution; propaganda; satire; visual history; imagology
AB This article analyses anti-Leninist visual propaganda and examines the reasons for its low effectiveness. The author studies the morphological structure of Lenin's images as an internal and external enemy, "the other": a German spy, Judas, Hun, anarchist, or a member of the Black Hundreds. It is demonstrated that the sources of anti-Leninist images were visual political satire of the previous period and mass rumours. In some cases, anti-Leninist images were provoked by the radical statements and actions of Ulyanov himself. Anti-Leniniana was even beneficial to Bolsheviks: Lenin, previously unknown to the general public, became one of the most prominent political antagonists. Widespread public fears and premonitions were reflected in the images, which makes visual satire a mirror of the era. The low effectiveness of anti-Leninist propaganda can be explained by various factors, i. e. the use of propaganda stamps which most people had already gotten tired of during World War I; the inversion of images in the perceptions of different social strata; excessive stigmatisation of the Bolsheviks, who, as they approached October, began to be perceived as victims of the tired regime of A. F. Kerensky; and the counter-propaganda of the Bolsheviks themselves.

AB Globalization is one of the most important phenomenon that characterizes modern development. Globalization tendencies change. There are a lot of articles concerning post-globalization. Many scientists suppose that the new age is a post-globalization one. However, there is no definition of post-globalization itself. Each of the studies covers just a part of this phenomenon. The post-globalization stage substantially differs from globalization one. The article is dedicated to the definition of post-globalization and its main characteristics. To archive this, all scientific works in the field of post-globalization were combined in several groups: studies that examine post-globalization or some aspects of it directly, and different scientific works that are dedicated to the end of the globalization era. The research is based on previous studies and mentions of post-globalization in different contexts. The results of the research proposed five key characteristics of post-globalization and eight economic statements about differences between the globalization and post-globalization stages, including directions of business development, basis of the economic growth, level of social inequality, key industries, and others. It was concluded that post-globalization was the arrangement of social dynamics processes, the basis of which were previously ones of globalization. These processes have had social, economical, cultural, political, and military aspects. Post-globalization is the period of society's development. This period has some specific characteristics. The article helps to predict changes in the future global development. (C)2020 INT TRANS J ENG MANAG SCI TECH.

TI Skin in the Game: Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life
SO MIR ROSSII-UNIVERSE OF RUSSIA
LA Russian
DT Book Review
DE risk; institutions; information; success; ergodicity; non-ergodicity;
   consistency
AB In 2018, the most recent book by Nassim Taleb "Skin in the Game: Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life" was finally made available to Russian readers. In it, just like in his previous bestsellers, the author raises several topical questions and offers his vision of their solutions. Taleb's books are full of interesting and important claims, however, much more remains unsaid. The last book is no exception, and therefore I reflect on its contents, provide my comments on it, supplement the fundamental ideas of Taleb, and "embed" the key theses of the book in the context of modern social sciences. To do this, I propose a geometric model of the skin-in-the-game principle, which superimposes two population distribution functions - that of income and that of risk. I show that the extent of the divergence in the forms of the two curves acts as an imperfection of society and illustrates the degree of implementation of this principle. I further argue that this corresponds to the global civilizational trend, according to which the risks shift from the physical world into the social. The article demonstrates that the skin-in-the-game principle was widely used in the Soviet Union during Stalin's era, and for many years has been promoted in the modern political discourse in Russia by opposition parties and leaders. In modern international politics, this principle is fully consistent with the act of recognizing the Golan heights by the USA as legitimate Israeli territory. To illustrate how non-ergodicity emerges as a feature of a social system, I offer some simple formulas for quantifying the effectiveness of the system that take into account the emergence factor stemming from the interaction between the system's elements. I also show the substantive equivalence of the doctrines of non-ergodicity and unpredictability offered by Taleb, Douglass North and George Soros. I argue that Taleb's concept of local ethics is closely related to Fukuyama's concept of the radius of trust. In conclusion, I consider an expanded model of personal success, which rests on five factors: natural talent, the ability to work, the factor of fortune, inheritance, and the effect of shifting risk to third parties.

TI Collective Capitalist Property in the Institutional Structure of Russia
   in the 1930s-1980s
SO ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CHANGES-FACTS TRENDS FORECAST
LA English
DT Article
DE Russia; USSR; state capitalism; institutions; institutional mechanisms;
   property; proto-bourgeoisie
AB The article deals with a subject of the possibility of applying the institutional theory to the study of the economic structure of Soviet Russia and the use of its individual elements to solve the problems of improving the efficiency of public administration at the present development stage of this country. The purpose of the work is to consider the basic issues of the evolution of the country's socio-economic development at the stage of bifurcation. The novelty of the research is that it shows the evolutionary trends of the property institute and the political and ideological mechanisms of their ensuring in the 1930s-1980s. The emphasis is put on identifying the stages of property relations transformation: from the formation of collective capitalist ownership in the period of 1930s-1950s to the trends to its individualization in the 1960s-1980s. The turn of the 1990s is considered as a period of fundamental change of the collective capitalist property institute. According to the authors, the formation of a proto-bourgeois class of co-owners, which provided capitalist tendencies in the society's development, was of great importance in Soviet times. The article shows the ideological content of trends leading to the capitalist transformation of Russia, which consist in justifying the property rights concentration. The change in the social base of the ruling class formation, the inclusion of the representatives of the intellectuals' class and the intelligentsia in its composition were quite important in this process. It is noted that privatization in the course of market transformations broke the existing property relations in the Soviet period and led to an increase in social inequality. The authors emphasize the urgent need to restructure modern state policy in terms of taking into account the mentality of the "Russian life" and economic traditions that developed during the Soviet period.

AB The article uses primary sources not previously published, including draft minutes of the CPSU Central Committee Secretariat during the period 1966-1967. This primary source clearly demonstrates the practice of making the most important decisions in one of the most important bodies of the party apparatus during the formation of the practice of "collective leadership". The article shows the place of the CPSU Central Committee Secretariat in the power structure of the USSR. Despite the brevity of notes, an analysis suggests several conclusions about the political and economic orientations of the country's leaders in the early Brezhnev period. Speeches made during discussions of various issues demonstrate the desire of party leaders to move away from unjustified (in their opinion), reforms of the Khrushchev-era management apparatus and to focus instead on systematic changes aimed at strengthening the role of the party-state apparatus is and improving the economy. The article also analyzes speeches by individual party leaders who most clearly expressed their position, such as L. I. Brezhnev, M. A. Suslov, D. F. Ustinov, and A. N. Shelepin. The article discusses the organization of the activities of the Secretariat of the CPSU Central Committee: the composition of participants in meetings, the distribution of responsibilities between them, the procedure for preparing agenda items for meetings of departments of the Central Committee of the CPSU, the practice of discussions, and attempts to streamline the work of the Secretariat.

DE "soft power"; diplomacy; higher education; Central Asia; NArFU named
   after M. V. Lomonosov
AB Introduction. Currently the notion of the "soft power" is perceived as an effective way of nation's non-forcible influence on other countries with a view to implement one's own objectives. Suchlike implementation is confined to particular spheres to form a positive image of the nation. Higher education today is one of the most efficient instruments of the "soft power" implementation in the countries of Central Asia, for it allows securing friendly political and economic elite as well as enhancing the quality of labour migrants to the Russian Federation. The aim of the research is to analyze particular features of the "soft power" implementation in the domain of higher education in case with the region of Central Asia on the example of Northern (Arctic) Federal University named after M.V. Lomonosov (the city of Arkhangelsk, Russia, henceforth NArFU). Methods and materials. The study is based on systematic and comparative approaches to the analysis of the Russian "soft power" strategy in the domain of higher education. The study in hand also draws on general approaches to the "soft power" implementation in the region of Central Asia. The main sources for the analysis are annual reports on implementing the NArFU programme of development. These reports pay a great deal of attention to academic recruiting and academic mobility. Analysis. The Central Asia region is crucial from the view point of Russia's interests. The region is rich in hydrocarbon deposits, it boasts a great transit potential in international trade, and this is the region where the biggest number of migrants come from to Russia. For these reasons Russia is strengthening its "soft power" influence on Central Asian countries in general and in the sphere of higher education in particular. From the very day of the NArFU foundation in 2010, the region of Central Asia has been considered as a high-priority region. The example of NArFU demonstrates that the number of international students in the total number of full-cycle students has risen by 8.4 times, wherein the growth is secured mainly by students from Central Asian countries. Central Asian students' percentage of the total number of international students is 82-89.3%. The percentage of students from the region in question, doing short-term educational programmes is also high - 49.5-61.4%. Diverse mechanisms are exploited to attract would-be students to NArFU: agreements with educational establishments of the region; visits of NArFU's representatives (both lecturers and students) to the region; NArFU's participation in international exhibitions on education; presenting NArFU's educational programmes on the basis of "Rossotrudnichestvo" regional offices; inviting school graduates to study within the quota for fellow-countrymen residing abroad; arranging off-site university testing and multi-disciplinary intellectual contests; higher educational allowances and medical insurance compensation; active promotion with the help of social media. The international Friendship Club and the team of tutors were set up to ensure better social and cultural adaptation, regular events and excursions take place on the same purpose. Results. Despite the fact that there is no general state-level integral concept on attracting school graduates from the countries of Central Asia to the universities of Russia, NArFU managed to occupy the niche on the educational market of the region.
   University's administration has been pursuing a clear course towards attracting would-be students from Central Asia, exploiting a wide range of mechanisms to enhance academic recruiting, relying upon the advantages of Arkhangelsk region in the sphere of migrants' adaptation. Over the recent ten years the factors mentioned above have brought about more than eight times growth of students from the region of Central Asia in NArFU.

AB The article presents a today's spatio-temporal panorama ahead of the great date of Cosmonautics Day and the events of 20 years ago in the context of the significance of spiritual and cosmic values for Russian people. Russian philosopher K.N. Leontiev, diplomat and publicist, emphasized the danger of liberalism and the philistinism of life in Russia and other Orthodox countries: "You need to strengthen yourself, think less about weal and more about strength. If there is power, there will be some weal" [12]. A retrospective look at the "zero" years allows us to understand the pain points of the national and spiritual interests of Russia, the importance of reviving Russia's space stronghold, preserving the political and ethical attitudes that meet the goals and objectives for which future generations will continue the cosmic achievements of the previous century.

   elites; mode of production; social formation
ID CELEBRITY
AB The idea of the post-capitalist society has long been associated with the "grassroots" struggle of the exploited classes for the society that is free from all forms of domination and exploitation. D.Davydov does not consider this approach scientific and proposes one should change the lens of research and focus on what is happening at the level of the elites, where the new world is slowly maturing and new relationships are often intertwined with the old ones.
   The article is devoted to the justification of the argument, according to which the development of the post-capitalist social relations has been going on for a relatively long time - as the rise of people who "possess a personality" (personaliat). The author demonstrates that the unfolding processes can be explained by the deep economic changes - the transformation of creativity into the predominant source of consumer values. The author elaborates the idea that the essence of the knowledge economy is not capitalist or even is anti-capitalist, but at the same time he suggests that it is the nature of social relations around creative activity that should be considered rather than creative activity per se. From his point of view, despite the fact that the consequences of such activities complicate the functioning of the capitalist economy, the demise of the old economy does not mean that somewhere beyond the horizon we will have a cloudless non-antagonistic future. It is much more relevant to view post-capitalist transformation as the gradual rise to dominance of those who possess power over public attention.
   The author starts the article with a brief "history of personality" and after that demonstrates how the depersonalized world was gradually "colonized" by creative public figures. According to his conclusion, today we witness a large-scale transformation of the Political, which is associated with the trend that representatives of personaliat assumed roles of key actors in the political process. Power is transferred from those with money to those with personality. However, this shift in itself hardly guarantees the establishment of an egalitarian social order that has overcome all forms of alienation and inequality. Moreover, at the moment such prospect looks doubtful.

We hypothesize that despite the path-dependency problem and the view that informal institutions can be successful only in the long term (both widely accepted by sociologists and neo-institutional economists), strong exogenous shocks can demolish old informal institutions, leading to either anomie or anarchy (or anomie followed by anarchy, when a parallel social order emerges and co-exists with the previously established one). One of the ways which social groups develop to overcome such anomie is the spontaneous development of criminal culture, which rapidly establishes a new set of informal institutions that can effectively resist exogenous regulatory, political and economic pressures. The current study focuses on the case of organized poaching activities in the Caspian Sea after the collapse of the USSR. It illustrates such situations of anomie which led to the marginalization of small-scale fisheries, the further development of autonomous fishing communities in the regions and the rapid rise of organized sturgeon poaching as the main survival strategy. The study shows that the most developed social groups of autonomous communities are placed in piedmont areas of Dagestan ensuring maximum self-regulatory effectiveness through kinship networks and religious practices.

DT Article
DE institutions; institutional change; game theory; game equilibrium;
   evolutionary-institutional approach
ID NEED
AB This study is inspired by a terminological collision, which can be expressed by the following question: if institutions are the "rules of the game", how do they relate to game theory? We admit that most researchers who have applied a game-theoretic approach in the context of institutional problems do not explicitly define "institution" within a simulated game. So it is not always clear what are the "rules of the game" in the specific game setting? The article aims to consider existing approaches to understanding and modelling institutions by various schools of institutionalism relying on the game theory formalism. As the starting point, we consider two limiting cases among the existing approaches, namely, institutions are presented as games themselves and as equilibria in the games. We pay special attention to the understanding of the institutions as game equilibria, but also analyze such approaches to institutions as game forms, correlation devices, information systems, and so on. Given the multifaceted nature of game theory, we focus on those types of game settings that may be useful for understanding institutional change, i.e., for modelling endogenous institutions. We treat endogenous institutions as subsystems in repeated games. We also compare two programs for modelling institutional change - the evolutionary-institutional approach to the institutions that regulate cooperation in the context of social dilemmas, as well as the modern political economy approach based on the commitment problem in the games with political power. A review of the requirements for game-theoretic formulation needed to model institutional change completes the study.

DT Article

AB The article attempts to conceptualize the "caliphate" created by the Islamic State terrorist group (IS, banned in Russia) through the lenses of the phenomenon of an unrecognized state. Comparing the "caliphate" with the bulk of the unrecognized states that exist today, the author focuses on the territorial identity of the "caliphate" of the Islamic State, the role of the military factor in its formation, the peculiarities of its domestic policy and the specifics of its relations with the outside world.
   The author's analysis shows that the "caliphate" of the Islamic State represents an entity that is in many ways unique to the modern system of international relations. Unlike other unrecognized states, it did not seek integration into the international community and openly challenged this community, encroaching on the inviolability of state borders, organizing terrorist attacks abroad and explicitly ignoring generally accepted humanitarian norms. Rejecting the model of the nation-state, the "caliphate" refused to identify itself with the actually controlled territory. Not only did it fail to make efforts to create a civil nation out of its population, but it also emphasized its "Islamic cosmopolitanism". Throughout the short history of its existence, its trajectory of state-building was largely determined by militarization and radical Islamist ideology. At the same time, similarly to other unrecognized states, the "caliphate" had to solve a wide range of problems related to the organization of management in the controlled territories and mitigation of the consequences of the lack of international recognition.

AB The article analyzes the problem of productivity of using a civilizational approach to the analysis of the current state of Russia and its history. The content of the term "civilization" is discussed. The necessity of understanding civilization in two modes of implementation is proved: as a process and as a state. "Civilization" is interpreted by the author as an interdisciplinary category to denote the diversity of cultural and historical types of development of economically and politically connected large communities of people and/or their aggregates (communities), subjectively and symbolically integrated into a relatively unified whole through historical and social imagination, cultural meanings, values and norms that serve as the cause, purpose and basis for the organization and functioning of these communities. This definition is concretized by revealing the dialectics of the relationship of social, cultural, cognitive and institutional components of "civilization" using the example of Russia in the historical range from Kievan Rus to the modern Russian Federation. The most important institutional factors in the formation and development of civilizations, their interaction and expansion over long distances were "universal States" - "kingdoms" and "empires". Studying the formation and development of the Grand Duchy of Moscow, the Russian Empire and the USSR, the author comes to the conclusion that historically these political forms had several civilizational embodiments.

AB Soils store much more carbon (C) than all terrestrial plants and the Earth's atmosphere together, and the C exchange between soils and atmosphere largely influences the CO2 contents in the atmosphere. While converting native ecosystems into agricultural land in the past caused a huge historical release of C into the atmosphere, an optimization of the management of agricultural soils offers the possibility of restoring parts of the previously lost C in the soil. However, in this respect, interrelationships of land use and soil management with climate change must be considered. In this chapter, land use and climatic effects on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in the large western Siberian grasslands will be evaluated and scenarios of future development of SOC storage will be given. A combination of soil analysis along a climatic gradient from the forest steppe to the dry steppe and a modelling approach with the Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed Land (LPJmL) model revealed, that since their cultivation soils of the Kulunda steppe lost about 20-35% of their organic C. Surprisingly, not only particulate organic C was affected but likewise also organic C located within mineral-organic associations was lost, and the proportion of the lost C is independent from the climatic conditions. Parts of this lost organic C can be restored by abandoning arable land. However, due to political and economic constraints, this does not seem to be likely. Minimum or zero tillage may provide an option to increase the organic C storage in western Siberian steppe soils, but the potential effect may be limited. The LPJmL model simulates a continuing climate-change driven C loss from soil, which corroborates results of soil analysis along the climatic gradient. The management of SOC stock has to be evaluated also for its effect on soil erosion, water deficiency and nutrient shortage.

LA Russian
DT Article
ID CONQUEST
AB The article tells the story of the creation of the Russian Corps of Topographical Engineers in the wake of the Napoleonic Wars and its development into a major driving force behind imperial expansion in Central Asia over the next half century. The author contends that the surveys of hitherto unexplored territories by military topographers influenced the mental maps of imperial political and academic elites. These mental maps ascribed characteristics of physical reality to abstractions of topographic charts, for instance, treating contour lines of relief as "natural boundaries." Political decisions were often based on such assumptions formed by reading topographic maps, driving the actual political border farther on to match "natural boundaries." Most military topographers were recruited from the lower social strata, and their high productivity in surveying uncharted territories was their chance for being promoted and hence for advancing their social status. This combination of social and epistemological factors resulted in escalating the mechanism of imperial territorial expansion, both mental and political.

AB The article discusses the features of the American system of export control on dual-use products, which allowed it to become an important tool of foreign policy. Using system-historical and system-functional methodology, the author analyzed the evolution of the US export controls through the prism of changes in the American concept of national security. The task is to investigate why the system, created during the Cold war, is so popular today. Three periods are designated: the period of the Cold War, the 1990s - the first decade of the 2000s, the present stage. Within each stage the author analyzes significant changes in the export control legislation. The export control policy in the United States was revised in the light of new approaches to the problems of national and international security, as well as foreign policy objectives. In 1994, COCOM was dismantled. In the 90's and early 2000' issues of nonproliferation of WMD and prevention of WMD falling into the hands of terrorist groups began to occupy a key place in the policy of national security and export controls of the United States. This contributed to increasing cooperation between Russia and the United States. The two countries managed to improve the multilateral export control regimes, to hold Resolution 1540 in the UN Security Council in 2004, which strengthened the international legal framework of the export controls. There is an acute internal political struggle around the export controls rules. Leading agencies, supported by individual groups of the political elite, are trying to impose their strategic priorities. Export controls are viewed by the business community as a restrictive measure. Naturally, business is lobbying for easing the export controls mode. Academic circles also actively support their right to free exchange of scientific and technical information. One can observe a constant tug of war between supporters of softening and tightening of the regime. The interpretation of US national security is qualitatively expanding due to dispersion of challenges and threats to its global leadership, the emergence of new breakthrough technologies in the civil and defense fields. Particular concern of the USA is the development of China's military and innovative potential, in connection with which there is a painful attitude to the possible transfers of American technologies to China. Export controls is considered to be the most important mechanism preventing such transfers. At present, the development of the American export control regime is undergoing a new toughening cycle. The position of hardliners within the US political elite in the implementation of such a policy is strengthening. The United States is looking for an enemy and trying to make it common to the entire Western world. The role of embargoes and sanctions in the American export control regime, as well as extraterritorial application of American rules, has increased again. The export control regime is used as a tool to maintain U.S. leadership in a changing world, to reorganize the world order in the interests of the United States.

AB The article provides a systematic review of the main, existing methodologies of the global monitoring and forecasting of socio-political destabilization. A systematic analysis of the correlation between the forecasts of destabilization generated by these systems and the actual levels of destabilization observed in the respective countries has been carried out. The analysis shows that the forecast, based on the assumption that the level of destabilization in each country in the following year will be proportional to the actual level of destabilization of the current year, turns out, in all cases, to be more predictive than the forecasts made on the basis of any of the considered indices of the risk of destabilization (at least for all cases when the relevant forecasts were published). At the same time, it is shown that, before the Arab Spring, the indices we considered still performed some useful function, allowing us to identify not so much countries with a high risk of destabilization as those countries with particularly low risks of this kind. However, in 2010-2011, all destabilization risk indices had a very serious failure. High index values not only turned out to be not-very-good predictors of a high degree of the actual destabilization in 2011, but also low index values turned out to be bad predictors of a low degree of actual destabilization. As a result, all destabilization risk indices in 2010/2011 showed extremely low statistically-insignificant correlations between the expected and observed levels of destabilization, which can be attributed to the anomalous wave of 2011 launched by the events of the Arab Spring. As we have shown in several ways, the predictive ability of indices had been restored to some extent, again becoming statistically significant after 2011, but it has not returned to the level observed before the Arab Spring. This confirms the conclusions of our previous work that the Arab Spring in 2011 acted as a trigger for the global phase transition, resulting in the World System changing into a qualitatively new state in which we observe some new patterns that were not taken into account by the systems developed before the Arab Spring. Thus, the existing systems of forecasting the risks of socio-political destabilization have lost the last "competitive advantages" over the method of simple extrapolation. There are grounds to believe that the pandemic of the coronavirus infection COVID-19 may lead to an additional decrease in the prognostic ability of the indices we have examined. All this, of course, suggests the need to develop a new generation of systems for forecasting the risks of socio-political destabilization.

AB The article looks at various approaches to the study of the unity and uniqueness of modern nomadic cultures of Central Asia (Tuvan, Kalmyk, Mongol, Khakass, Altai etc.), developed by Russian scholars since the 19th century. Our analysis focuses on published works in the field of culturology that studied the value-semantic cultural core. These publications can be divided into three large research fields which match a specific stage of academic knowledge development: 1) the field of comparative history; 2) the field of studying the universals of culture, and 3) that dealing with both universals and unique features of culture, making use of the emic and ethical approaches. The article examines each of the fields by studying sample approaches in individual monographs, articles, and collections.
   The field of comparative historical analysis has been around since the 19th century and includes studies developing historicaltypological and historical-genetic comparisons and generalizations. The common feature here is the distinction between two language groups (Turkic and Mongolian) representing two diverse cultural areas. The field of studying cultural universals arose in 1980s and focuses on universal categories common for all cultures. In early 21st century, a new field followed suit, the one which covered both cultural universals and unique elements. Its distinctive element is the subjectivity of researchers and an opportunity for then to select a methodological stance. Within this field, details of studying cultures are determined by the emic and ethical aspects of research approaches.

TI PATRIOTISM AS POLITICAL DISCOURSE IN CONTEMPORARY RUSSIA
SO POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE patriotism; civic identity; public discourse; symbolic policy; political
   struggle
AB The authors characterize patriotism not only as an academic concept but as a method of political argument articulation. Academic discourse is analyzed on the basis of the idea of concept circulation. The article is based on identity studies, with patriotism understood as a form of identity which is constructed by pluralities of actors and the highly competitive character of its process. The authors characterize the struggle for interpreting patriotism and identifying patriots in public discourse and the media in Russia today. They consider that state actors and pro-government publicists are dominant, but not the only actors of constructing patriotism. Analyzing the understanding of patriotism in public opinion, the authors notice that patriotic consciousness and feelings are not the direct result of symbolic policy influence. They have a more or less high level of independence despite such influence. The problems with the conceptualization of patriotism are connected with the disputable nature of the concept and, more importantly, with its political content. In the authors' opinion, patriotism is seen as a political attitude, although it includes love for the Motherland as an emotional component. This political attitude is the self-identification of people as citizens of a state, whose institutions, in their view, are in the public interest. Thus, the political functions of patriotism are associated with the legitimation-delegitimation of the power and the formation of identity. This is why the struggle for the identification of patriotism is so hot. In framework the delegitimation of power, the significance of patriotism could rise, but accompanied with the search for another political actor as its subject. The authors consider the rise of patriotic discourse and the ever-stronger struggle for the identification of patriotism in political processes of the near-future. Important marks were demonstrated in July-August 2019, when the participants of protests used the Constitution and flag of the Russian Federation as propaganda tools.

SO ISTORIYA-ELEKTRONNYI NAUCHNO-OBRAZOVATELNYI ZHURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE France; ideas of superiority; colonial culture; history; geography;
   school textbooks; pedagogy
AB The author of this article takes as his starting point the idea that the colonial expansion and the experience of learning about the world in the 19th - early 20th centuries were fully reflected in the process of self-identification of European societies and the substantiation of the idea of their civilization, culture, and superiority. The colonial factor and colonial culture could give vitality to national identity, allowing the reformatting of the national space. In France, colonial expansion began to be perceived by various social strata as the best way to strengthen the country, and colonial culture was gradually becoming a familiar element of public consciousness. The French, like other European nations, took the colonial idea from school. Using the example of educational narratives (school textbooks and anthologies), the author shows the penetration of elements of colonial culture into the public consciousness. The French school at the turn of the 19th - 20th centuries became a "testing ground for progress", where new social, political, and economic technologies were tested. The school became one of the places where the ideas of superiority were formed. French pedagogy was inextricably linked with colonial culture. All textbooks, both for secular and church schools, placed the civilizing work of France at the forefront. From this point of view, the plan for the formation of souls, its tasks, current and future, were presented. The author concludes that the formation of the French colonial empire led to the strengthening of the national at the expense of the colonial and to their active rapprochement. The colonial idea and colonial culture contributed to the awareness of the French of their belonging to a single nation, the formation of their national identity, and pedagogical practices played a special role in this process.

AB Introduction. In the current political process in Russia, national projects occupy an important place, working as one of the main tools for the achievement of national goals. The projects are usually made more specific at the regional level of administration and include the strategic goal of regional development, the amount of resources allocated for their achievement, as well as the responsibility of the officials for their use. The article examines the impact of implementing national projects of the "first wave" (from 2006-2010 to 2018) and the first results of the projects of the "second wave" (designed for 2019-2024) on solving the problems of effectiveness growth of public administration of the balanced development of old industrial regions of Southern Russia - Volgograd and Rostov regions. The problems of this study are justified by the expansion of using program-targeted methods in the organizational environment of regional management, what implies the need to assess the compliance of the results achieved during the implementation of projects with the goals of state regional policy. Methodology and methods. The research methodology is based on the provisions of the concept of sustainable development, as well as the system paradigm of G.B. Kleiner devoted to the need for the interconnected development of the object, environment and control subsystems. In the study of the effectiveness of national projects and their impact on the s=1 balanced development of old industrial regions of the South of Russia, the effective approach and the comparative analysis method were used. Analysis. The study shows that the degree of involvement of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation in implementing program activities of national projects is determined by the volumes of regional budgets, as well as the priorities facing a region. From the standpoint of sustainability and balance of regional development, there is a disagreement in the processes of modernization changes in the subsystems of the object, environment and management, what leads to the underutilization of the resource potential of the regions in the achievement of national goals. Results. The priorities of goal setting in Volgograd and Rostov regions in the implementation of national projects are studied. The feedbacks of the regional system to the measures mentioned in national projects, as well as limiting factors for the achievement of their objectives are identified. The idea of the coordinated development of the object, environment and management subsystems of a region for the effectiveness growth of public administration of the balanced regional development is substantiated. It is concluded that the administration and management of modern national projects is not so much a managerial task but rather apolitical one, and therefore their implementation implies the solution of such political goals as carefulness in setting goals and choosing priorities, building effective mechanisms of the interaction between federal and regional authorities, and also with local target population.

DE ethnicity; identity policy; institutionalization; methodology; national

ID POLITICS
AB This article discusses the theoretical and methodological aspects of the manifestation of ethnicity and of its institutionalization in the regional identity policy of Russian republics. The author analyzes how ethnicity is included in politics. Indicators are identified that indicate the expression of ethnicity in identity politics. Identity policies as policies promoted by state actors are regarded as systemic and aimed at institutionalising ethnic categories thus helping create and sustain a sense of "Us - Them" and form subjective assessments towards such categories. The use of socio-constructivist methodology leads us to the conclusion that identification and institutionalization are related processes that occur simultaneously and mutually reinforce each other. The institutionalization of ethnicity is manifested in the rooting of ethnic categories in the political process of the republics and their role of maintaining or changing the regional institutional order. Building on this assumption, the author proposes an analytical model based on the allocation of three levels of the process of ethnicity institutionalization in identity politics: the normative, the narrative-mythological, and the symbolic level. The normative level includes the establishment of ethnic categories in the political institutions of the region and is manifested in the normative consolidation of ethnic discourse, i.e. in normative documents, in the distribution of power positions, in language policies expressing ethnic preferences etc. The narrative-mythological level determines the significance of ethnic markers in the discourse of regional historical memory and myth-making. The symbolic level is defined as the incorporation of ethnicity into the symbolic attributes of the region. A set of indicators can be used to operationalize this three-level model in empirical studies of ethnicity institutionalization in Russian republics.

AB A well-developed party system has emerged in Estonia over the decades of independence. There are, however, distinct geographical patterns of voting. A number of new political parties have appeared in the country; the regional and ethnic patterns of voting (the latter matter much in Estonia) have changed dramatically. This study aims to analyse the recent changes in the Estonian party system as well as the causes of these changes and the effect of the ethnic and geographical factors on the transformation of the electoral behaviour of Estonian citizens. The research employs a systemic approach that makes it possible to solve the agent-structure problem to the benefit of the general structure and integral system of Estonia's party scene. The method of comparative systemic analysis is used alongside those adopted in electoral geography. It is concluded that the effect of the ethnic and geographical factors on electoral behaviour is diminishing as a civil society based on civic rather than ethnic principles is emerging in the country. The main drivers of the change are the formation of new parties and coalition-building - both have an immediate effect on how the image of the parties is perceived by voters.

TI THE RED MACHINE: THE DEHUMANIZATION OF THE COMMUNIST ENEMY IN
   AMERICAN COLD WAR CINEMA
SO QUAESTIO ROSSICA
LA English
DT Article
DE image of Russia; Cold War; US cinema; image of the enemy;
   dehumanization; propaganda
AB This article deals with the US Cold War cinematographic construction of the Soviet enemy. The researcher focuses on the means of dehumanising the communist enemy, external and internal, by equating it to a machine. The author applies Nick Haslam's dual model of dehumanization (2006), according to which dehumanization is visible in two main forms: animalistic, by associating members of the out-group with animals, and mechanistic, by associating them with a soulless machine. The materials used consist of US films from the "Long Fifties", in which Hollywood, equating the enemy to machines, developed three plots: the robotic existence of individuals in a totalitarian society; the transformation of Americans into zombies by communists by means of Soviet science; and the body snatching of Americans by an alien mind, an allegory of a future communist occupation of the USA. The article demonstrates that dehumanization was implemented by directly labeling the representatives of the communist world as robots and by attributing to them a lack of emotions, consciousness, will, individuality, initiative, warmth, love, friendship, creative abilities, and even the ability to smile. Such an image of the enemy implied a moral exclusion, treating them as an inanimate object unworthy of empathy, including in the event of their destruction. The author points out that the use of mechanistic dehumanization was very effective. Essentialization of the differences between "us" and "them" occurred: the symbolic border between them is presented as a boundary between living and nonliving. The image of mortal danger was created: the "Red Machine" is strong and merciless, it cannot be moved to pity, and so it is permissible to destroy it. This image contributed to the legitimation of power: the political opponents of the authorities are represented as internal enemies who are anxious to turn Americans into obedient executors of someone else's will and to deprive them of humanity. At the same time, the machine also has weaknesses, and it is possible to defeat it: since it is devoid of human creativity, it is clearly inferior to the free human spirit embodied in America.

AB This paper explores the phenomenon of e-voting, in particular, new i-voting technologies, within the context of hybrid and authoritarian political regimes. While e-voting and i-voting are not particularly widespread, more and more illiberal countries are implementing these innovations, which has been overlooked in the academia so far. The paper attempts to fill in this gap. Firstly, we provide a general overview of the problem and identify the key features of non-democracies adopting e-voting and i-voting. Secondly, we explore the case of Russia, a hybrid regime, which may become a role model for other countries in the near future. The research exposes the potential of e-voting, and in particular, i-voting as a tool for the regime stability and provides some avenues of the future research.

AB The article considers the situation associated with the coronavirus pandemic in Russia and in the world as a whole and its possible consequences for the economy, politics, and sociocultural processes. The author analyzes the publications that have appeared recently and focused on questions about what the world expects after the end of the pandemic. In the reviews of the topic "The World after the Pandemic" some optical defects typical of technocratic positivism were revealed. The reduction of levels of psychohistory and psychoideology leads to an underestimation of the scale of the disaster and the breakdown of communication between the regulator and the population. The "historical size" of events of this kind is set by the great plague epidemics in their influence on the way out of the Middle Ages into the Modern civilization. Such comparability confirms the appeal to images of emptiness in art and philosophy. The symbolism of "life on pause" speaks about the scale and possible irreversibility of changes, at least in local civilizations. Thus, the coronacrisis undermines the foundations of the resource society and the "civilization of oil" - the basis of the Russian political ethnonarcissism. A closed circuit with positive feedback is formed, its swing is fraught with landslide changes and risks with unacceptable damage. Tough clashes with reality strike at the regimes of simulation, political postmodernism in general. Ideas about "political eschatology" and plurality of interpretations of the concept of civilization allow us to discuss the prospects of transformation of the civilizational project in Russia.

SO POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA
LA Russian

   expectations; social order; causes of poverty; good governance
ID GOOD GOVERNANCE; WEALTH
AB The article deals with issues around the relationship between political trust and satisfaction with political institutions, and confirms the isomorphism of these phenomena on the basis of the empirical data provided by all-Russian research. Existing research into trust in this field has concluded that, regarding institutions of the modern service state, satisfaction with the services they provide often reveals no relationship between this satistifcation and the level of trust in the government and other political institutions. In contrast to the satisfaction associated with the instrumental aspects of public institutions, satisfaction with the work of political institutions in this study demonstrates a strong correlation with trust, and is associated with the normative aspect of institutions. The article also examines the relationship between trust in political institutions and satisfaction with the perceptions of the causes of poverty in society as a fundamental social phenomenon related to the normative foundations of social order in Russia. The use of principal component factor analysis found that there are two alternative justifications of the causes of poverty: a structural justification (which associates poverty with the properties of existing institutions) and a non-structural justification (which does not associate poverty with institutional reasons). The structural justification of poverty negatively correlates with indicators of political trust and satisfaction with the performance of political institutions, whilst the justification of poverty by factors not controlled by institutions is associated with trust and satisfaction with positive correlation. People who assume that institutions are responsible for the reproduction of an unjust social order are less likely to trust them and less satisfied with their performance. The findings confirm that the normative aspect of political institutions is more important than the instrumental one.

AB The study of the GDR in modern historical science is predominantly based on the assertion of the artificial nature of the "SED dictatorship" imposed by the Soviet government on the population of East Germany solely for political reasons, as well as the subordination of the policy of the East European countries as a whole to the political line of the USSR. The national policy of the SED, in particular the concept of a "socialist state of the German nation," put forward in the second half of the 1960s by the SED leadership and affirmed in the first article of the Constitution of the GDR on April 8, 1968, was also subjected to unconditional criticism as an ideological instrument of political demarcation from the FRG. However, the study of previously unpublished materials from the Russian archives casts doubt on such statement and makes it possible to hypothesize that the demarcation of the German nation in the post-war period, despite the obvious political conditionality, was based on the objective public demand of the GDR citizens, exhausted with the war and the Nazi dictatorship, for social justice, the strengthening and expansion of humanistic principles in culture, social democratic traditions in government. Despite the predominance of communist ideology in its essence, the national policy pursued by the GDR government led to the formation of a special East German identity, which was also largely facilitated by fundamental differences in the socio-economic structure of the two German states and the foreign policy factor. The contradiction between these concepts raises a number of problematic research questions, the solution of which is of exceptional scientific importance for understanding the mechanisms of formation of national identity. Thus, the key scientific problem (addressed on the material of the GDR history), is whether changes in national self-consciousness can be artificial in nature or the stability of the ideologemes introduced into public consciousness is fundamentally impossible without socio-economic changes corresponding to the public demand.

DT Article
AB Utilizing the minutes of preparations of a manuscript textbook on the history of medicine (1948-1953), the authors reconstruct how it was decided to depict the history of world and Russian medicine; in so doing sacralizing the Soviet state and wildly overstating its care for the health of Soviet people. The archival documents allowed the authors of the article to show how the aspirations and interests of the medical elite in the sacralization of their own role encouraged historians of medicine to develop not a scientific, but an epic version of the past and to repress other versions through political accusations and condemnation of colleagues. The textbook, which had been created and discussed for a long time in the 1940s, was never published. Nevertheless, the authors' reconstruction of its aborted conception made it possible to reveal its enduring formulations in later Soviet and even present-day textbooks, and enduring capacity to shape a Soviet style historical imagination in doctors.

DE Eurasian land bridge; New Silk Road; Rail Baltica; transport corridors
AB Land-based Trans-Eurasian transport corridors, their current development and perspectives have been high on the political agenda in the last two decades not only in Europe and China but also in the transit countries such as Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan. A number of conceptual initiatives are already being implemented. The Belt and road or the one Belt, one road (OBOR) initiative on the Chinese side and the rail Baltica project from the European perspective have gained special attention. Big-scale infrastructural projects are also being implemented by transit countries, e.g., the construction of a motorway from China to Europe-from Kazakhstan via russia to Belarus-to facilitate the land-based shortcut for cargo transport within the Eurasian transport corridor. This article investigates the general framework conditions of infrastructural investments into projects related to Eurasian logistics and discusses strategic areas of intersection between the European activities and the New Silk Way. In the framework of the OBOR initiative, this article also addresses the interaction of the Chinese-Kazakh-Russian-Belarusian-Polish railway transport, with a special focus on Belarusian-Polish cross-border issues. The authors have participated in several projects focusing on transport corridors and discuss the research question of how different Eurasian land-based transport corridors can be integrated and which strategic role can the Rail Baltica project play in the context of the New Silk Route. The research is based on surveys, expert interviews, secondary data research and case studies.

   JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY SOCIOLOGY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE

DT Article
DE knowledge; knowability; factivity; epistemic logic; Fitch paradox
AB The article examines the question of whether knowability is factive. Most researchers admit that knowledge is factive, which is due to the standard definition of knowledge as true justified belief. But the question of the factivity of knowability is much more complex. This is especially evident in the context of debates on the Fitch paradox. The paradox shows that the straightforward formalization of 'p is knowable' as 'it is possible that p is known' is incorrect because it readily leads to a contradiction (granted some intuitively appealing principles). Those who want to preserve the principle of knowability (according to which every truth is knowable) attempt to elaborate alternative formalizations of knowability, free from paradoxical implications. Among them are Dorothy Edgington and Michael Fara. Edgington defines p's knowability as the possibility to know that p is true in the actual world, which renders knowability factive. Timothy Williamson's criticism on her proposal shows that it has some substantial flaws. Fara wants to amend Edgington's proposal preserving the factivity of knowability. He defines knowability of a proposition p as there actually being an agent who is capable to know that p is actually true. This definition also implies that knowability is factive. I examine Fara's proposal and show that it is essentially incomplete because of two reasons. First, Fara does not provide syntactic rules for the operator 'C-x' that he introduces to symbolize the agents' capacity to have knowledge. Secondly, I show that the standard modal semantics cannot be used in interpreting his definition of knowability, whereas he does not propose any nonstandard semantics for it. I argue that the flaws of both theories are due to the fact that they treat knowability as factive. This motivates my hypothesis that a concept of knowability free from factivity is needed to solve Fitch's paradox.

DT Article
DE USSR Cinema-Atlas; visual anthropology; Jewish Autonomous Region;
   Birobidzhan; Slutsky
AB At the turn of the 1920s to the 1930s, the production of so-called 'culturfilms' developed in the Soviet Union. These films showcased the country's constituent nationalities and territories and were popular with a wide audience. The production, though, had a political aspect to it, as cinematography was used by the authorities as an effective mass medium to inform the public about state programmes to colonize the country's regions. It is no coincidence that during this period an unprecedented project such as the 'Cinema-Atlas of the USSR' was launched on the initiative of the Party's Central Committee. The project was meant to bring together scientists and cinema specialists to create a film series of 150 episodes, dedicated to the historical traditions and Sovietization of the country's center and periphery. Developed as an ideologically inspired 'film manual', the series were to be subsequently introduced to and used in the Soviet education system. Leading Soviet film studios got involved in a socialist-style competition, aiming to organize longest possible film expeditions to the farthest corners of the USSR and fulfilling the ministerial task of collecting materials to construct on screen an image of a multinational and progressive socialist country. Drawing on the film 'Birobidzhan' (1934) by Mikhail Slutsky, a well-known figure in the Soviet cinematography, the article examines the format of documentary propaganda films that is fully consistent with the vision behind the Soviet 'Cinema-Atlas'. Focused on Jewish colonists in the Far East territories, the film was shot to present the successful resettlement efforts of the Society for Settling Working Jews on the Land (OZET), and its release was dedicated to the formation of the Jewish Autonomous Region with the administrative centre in the city of Birobidzhan. Comparative analysis of the film and archival materials on the context of its creation, recollections of the film shooting team members and other contemporaries allow us to trace the development of this cinematographic project in relation to the then Soviet politics, science, and culture. Finally, conclusions are drawn as to the potential of using this Soviet documentary as a multicomponent historical source of great research value for visual anthropology and the humanities.

AB The article explores the economic and social situation in Latin America after the "golden decade" (2003-2013) and political shifts in the region. During the last electoral cycle, the region witnessed a certain political landscape transformation, including the "right drift" on the one hand and the strengthening of the positions of the left forces on the other. Thus, political polarization at the national and regional levels sharply increased, integration blocks have disintegrated or are in crisis. As a result, the region is no longer a "unity in diversity". The author highlights the reasons for the intensification of European politics in Latin America. Although the economy remains a priority in interregional cooperation, political aspects are becoming increasingly important. Both regions actively cooperate in solving global problems, but their priorities differ significantly. The European Union cooperates with Latin America in strengthening multilateralism and improving global governance, both partners try to reform international institutions, reject protectionism and underline the priority of international law.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE classification of forms of corruption; political corruption; state
   policy corruption; administrative resources; state capture
AB The article analyzes the definitions of political corruption based on the following approaches used in political science to classify forms and manifestations of corruption: subject-oriented, actor-based and targeted. Within the framework of these approaches, we offer an updated definition of political corruption which can involve public officials of all levels. Political corruption is instrumentally defined as the unlawful use by a public official of various types of administrative resources of public authority to extract personal and (or) group political benefits (political enrichment), including in favor of third parties. The author singles out such form of corruption as state policy corruption, the essence of which is to skew the state policy in favor of private interests at the expense of public interests in order to unlawfully gain both tangible economic and intangible political benefits. The institutional mechanism of state policy corruption is the unlawful use by public officials of its legislative and regulatory administrative resources not to implement public policy in order to realize national interests and goals in various spheres of life of society and the state, but to create "rules of the game" that allow obtaining illegal advantage, to extract personal and (or) group benefit, which may have both tangible and intangible expression. Actors of such corruption can be senior public officials, whose competence includes adopting laws and regulations that determine state policy in various areas and mechanisms for its implementation. It is noted that state policy corruption is characterized by "autocorruption" - a situation where there is no external stimulation to commit a corruption act, it is not necessary, and its executor and final beneficiary are the same actor and (or) actors belonging to the same community. The author identifies the relationship between state policy corruption as a symbiosis of political and economic corruption at the highest levels of power and the peak of systemic corruption with corrupt state capture.

DE social inequality; digital inequality; digital inclusion; digital
   exclusion; digital inclusion policy
AB This article is dedicated to the explication of digital exclusion and inclusion. The heuristic potential of the e-inclusion concept lies in the overcoming of such a limitation as a binary explanation of digital division. Three levels of digital inequality were distinguished in western studies: in access, methods and outcomes of ICT use (M. Ragnedda, E. Hargittai, A. van Deursen, J. van Dijk, E. Helsper). Operationalization of digital inclusion reflects focusing of research lenses on differences in the degree and quality of engagement in ICT. Digital inclusion and exclusion mark social positions in the continuum of digital inequality. Mechanisms of exclusion operate on micro-, meso-, and macrolevels. The concept of relative digital deprivation takes into account the differences between absolute and relative, objective and subjective digital exclusion. Scientific approaches of digital and social exclusion covariance (I. Marien, L. Van Audenhove, E. Helsper) are described. Practices of exclusion/inclusion are realized in four fields (economic, cultural, social, and individual), which have two perspectives: online and offline. Predictors of exclusion, including digital (access, skills, motivation, etc.), socioeconomic and demographic variables, are characterized. For the detection of risk groups, it is necessary to consider the functioning of digital exclusion mechanisms which transcend socially and economically vulnerable strata. The corner stones for the policy of e-inclusion are inter-sector partnership; combination of a targeted approach to vulnerable strata with inclusion of all citizens; development of telecommunication infrastructure, digital competence, and networks of support; designing of e-government sites, devices and services oriented towards users; monitoring of policy; collecting data concerning people's digital skills. The policy of digital inclusion is directed at the extension of supply and stimulation of demand for ICT. The policy of supply is relevant at the stage of overcoming digital inequality in access gradations. Disparity in methods and outcomes of ICT use demands implementation of digital skills policy.

ID BREXIT; DISINTEGRATION
AB On January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom, a country with a population of 67 mln people and the fifth largest economy in the world, left the European Union. The case when a state ceased to be an EU member is the first in the history of European integration. Except for the episode with Greenland, which left the EEC in 1985, the group had invariably expanded before that. The currently available extensive body of literature on Brexit is mainly represented by works dedicated to Britain. Fewer works are devoted to the European Union; they mainly address institutional issues, such as the ratio of supranational and intergovernmental management methods and the pros and cons of differentiated integration. This article poses the problem more broadly. Its goal is to clarify how Brexit will affect the strategic potential of integration, not its forms. The author concludes that, although the European Union suffers significant economic, political, and conceptual losses, Brexit paradoxically imparts dynamism to the integration process. There emerge preconditions for the formation of two competing democratic regimes in Europe. The new situation draws a line under the 30-year (since the fall of the Berlin Wall) period of ideological and institutional domination of the EU as the only possible model of European development. Competition with Britain can be extremely useful for the European Union to rethink its attitudes, reject dogmas, and develop a new ideology of integration that would meet not the conditions of bipolar confrontation but the challenges of mature globalization.

AB Under Fast-Track Authority (FT), the US Congress commits to an up-or-down vote without amendments for any trade agreement presented for ratification. We interpret FT in terms of a hold-up problem. If the US negotiates an agreement with a smaller economy, businesses there may make sunk investments for the US market. At the ratification stage, the partner economy will be locked in to the US in a way it was not previously and Congress can make changes adverse to the partner, so to convince the partner to negotiate, it must first commit not to amend the agreement. FT is then Pareto-improving. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The main attention is paid to the policy of sanctions, to the EU's involvement into the negotiation process between the chavistas and the opposition, the humanitarian aid provided to the population of the Bolivarian Republic. The European Union faces difficult options. A de-escalation of tension with the government of Nicolas Maduro may strengthen the role of the EU in Venezuela. On the other hand, this policy could complicate the EU's relations with the United States and the opposition movements, which have united around the figure of Juan Guaido and have decided to boycott the parliamentary elections. The article is based on the latest factual data and sources that have not yet been introduced into scientific field.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE Latin America; social policy; poverty; inequality; conditional cash
   transfer programs; social expectations; protest moods
AB In the first decades of the 21st century, Latin American countries made significant steps towards social development. The period of the "Golden Decade" (2003-2013) was particularly successful, marked by high rates of economic growth, which most states of the region used to implement targeted social policies aimed at reducing poverty and social inequality, increasing employment, improving effectiveness of social protection of the population, education and health systems. An important part of the strategy for overcoming poverty were the conditional cash transfer programs, which aimed to reduce not only poverty, but also social exclusion, and to achieve a higher level of social development through small but permanent changes. The main actor of change would not be the state, but an individual or a family. Despite the ambiguity of the results obtained, which did not always correspond to efforts spent by the state, the experience of conditional cash transfer programs has become a part of an intensive search by Latin American countries for their own path of social development, due to specifics of accumulated problems and availability of real opportunities to solve them. The article analyzes the overall results of the policy on modernization of the social sphere, considers problems and challenges of the new stage. The latter began in 2014 and coincided with a slowdown in economic growth and general dissatisfaction with outcomes of social projects that did not lead to a drastic reduction of social inequality. The author highlights the key directions of forming a social strategy at the present stage, including a multi-factor approach to overcoming poverty, programs for young people, elderly people, and the native Indian population. There are new challenges relatable to the growth of mass social expectations, public disillusionment with the State's capabilities, and radical protest moods that increase the risks of political destabilization. The author comes to a conclusion that Latin American countries need to develop a new model of social policy aimed at radically overcoming social inequality, creating effective social elevators for young people from poor segments of society, and supporting a new middle class that has grown over the years of economic prosperity, but is vulnerable to the risks of a new economic crisis. Insufficient measures can reverse the process of social revival that has begun in the region.

   Perspectives for Cultural History
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL

DT Article
DE cultural studies of science; STS; environmental history; Novosibirsk
   Akademgorodok; science cities; Obninsk digital project
AB The aim and genre of the article is historiographic analysis and reflection on the potential history of Soviet science cities through the case of Novosibirsk Akademgorodok. The author reviews different approaches and theories to find an appropriate one for a modem study of Akademgorodok and social history of Soviet/post-Soviet science. It is quite a difficult problem because Akademgorodok is a complex space in which different contexts and social subjects intersect. The interest of traditional historiography in both Akademgorodok and Russian/Soviet history of science is pretty often connected with institutional questions (history of organizations, state policy, political dissidence) or chronicles of discoveries. The author's view is that the shift of research interest in the urban space of Akademgorodok, in micropolitics within scientific organizations, in laboratory studies within STS could give historians new contexts for big problem sets in the USSR (e.g. restart of a communist perspective in Khrushchev's time) or even in the world (e.g. forms of the Big Science stage). The author's research methodology is based on a broad field of modem cultural studies of science (including traditional extemalist approaches to the history of science and specific Bruno Latour's actor-network theory or Donna Haraway's cyberfeminist perspective). The article consists of two parts describing historiographic contexts of world and Soviet/Russian studies of science. In the first part, the author observes the connection between Russian/Soviet history of science and "big" social/political history and discusses two historiographic cases: (1) the case of Lysenkoism, which is the richest field of the Russian discipline that shows strong and weak sides of Russian history of science historiography; (2) the case of Akademgorodok and perspective research directions this field could initiate. The author proposes three possible contexts of new Soviet science cities history: (1) Akademgorodoks (not just in Novosibirsk but in Tomsk, Krasnoyarsk, and Irkutsk) as "Big Science" late-Soviet managerial projects; (2) the social anthropology of Novosibirsk Akademgorodok, search for its social, gender, academic diversity; (3) the environmental history of Akademgorodok's forests and parks, and the entire role of the Siberian Academy in raising ecological issues since the 1960s (Baikal discussion). The second part of the article is a schematic description and discussion of world science studies trajectories from first semi-philosophical works to the field of cultural studies of science. Summing up, the author makes an emphasis in Russian that the history of science is a historical discipline, it should proceed from historiographic contexts of "big" history and change them by its own contexts. The author finishes the article with a brilliant example of the Obninsk digital project and its consequences for the renovation of history as a science; such studies of science reflect the position of an academic scholar and relation to his/her sources.

AB The article discusses the role of universities in the formation of the regional and city brand. The authors reveal a whole range of problems showing step by step that the traditional marketing approach to branding, transferred from the commodity sphere to the sociopolitical one, even when equipped with extensive marketing research and presentations, is doomed to failure. The reasons are as follows. Today, the modern economy is inscribed in the "knowledge" paradigm. As for universities and university cities, they are (or are to be) on the front line of the socioeconomic frontier. Since their inception, the few universities have been a distinctive feature that elevates the city above others, an important support for the urban economy, a special lifestyle; they took an active part in the formation of meaning. The university has since become an indicator of wisdom, enlightenment, and knowledge. In the era of the Third Industrial Revolution, Ford's approach to the sociopolitical sphere turned not only cities, but also universities into an appendage of the production site, and reduced knowledge to the applied one, inscribing its share in the cost of goods. The contemporary "knowledge society" and the global economy are built on the ruins of the previous era, and universities are becoming not only centers for the export of knowledge, but also arbiters in the development of a branding strategy for "unpromising" regions (Italy), the core of the "living cities" of the devastated industrial belt (USA); they seek recognition and set networks within EU projects (Hungary). At the same time, there remains a contradiction that raises the question of the timeliness of referring to the city as a "political idea" that would allow uniting the leading forces - science, government, citizens (civil society), and the media - in the development of the city branding strategy. Undoubtedly, the number of stakeholders is much larger, but it is these forces that are capable of giving meaning to empty slogans and unreadable images - far from both the brand identity and the necessary residents' loyalty to it - that are so often found in the practice of regional strategies.

AB The tourism industry is the fastest growing industry in the world amidst the increase in terrorism, climate change, political instability, and other indirect negative effects on tourism. In order to survive this vulnerable, evolving, and competitive market, it is important that employees put effort into ensuring the provision of satisfactory services to satisfy customers' demand. For this purpose, this research determines the effect of personality traits on career competency (career control, reflection on motivation, networking, work exploration, self-profiling, and reflection on qualities) with the mediating role of career adaptability (curiosity concern, confidence, and control) and moderating role of gender identification. Career construction theory and social identity theory were used to justify these relationships. A total number of 330 questionnaires were filled and after discarding incomplete ones, 311 were retained for analysis, yielding a response rate of 94.2%. Using Analysis of Moment Structure 22.0 and Statistical Packages for Social Sciences 20.0, to analysis the study, the findings aid managers and policymakers in designing the organizational roles and on-the-job training for employees. Moreover, the relationship between personality traits and career adaptability can serve as a blueprint in employee recruitment and provide a new insight into employee selection. Theoretical and practical implications were provided in the concluding part.

AB The article explores the formation of the Russian Administration of Galician Railways in the autumn of 1914. The occupation of Eastern Galicia by Russian troops was followed by the organisation of the civil administration of Galicia.The Galician railways were initially managed by the Southwest Railways. However, it was decided to form a separate Galician network. On October 25, 1914, the Galician Railway Administration was organized, with KS. Nemeshaev appointed its director. Retreating from Galicia, the Austro-Hungarian army caused significant damage to Galician railways. The military situation on the front demanded fast restoration of railway communication to transport military goods and supplies for the army and evacuate the wounded. Meanwhile, the population of Galicia desperately needed regular passenger communication and freight traffic, thus the task was important both in the military and political terms. There were many factors complicating the work: the difference between the local narrow and Russian wide gauges, difficult terrain, lack of qualified personnel and rolling stock, and remoteness of Galicia. However, in the first three months of operation, the Railway Administration carried out large-scale repair and restoration work on the railway track, which had been thoroughly destroyed by the enemy during its retreat. By February 1915, the Railway Administration had been able to double its operating network. It had also begun the expansion and development of existing lines and stations and construction of new ones. Two lines were changed to the Russian gauge.

AB This article studies the legislative regulation of tourist activities in order to improve the investment climate. The authors consider the current state of the tourist services market and the reasons why the flow of tourists has significantly decreased and analyze the refund policy in case it is impossible to provide a tourist service due to the closure of the border during the pandemic. Based on the analysis of the international experience and the tourism industry in the Russian Federation, the authors developed recommendations to improve existing legislation and government policy towards the tourism industry, which should guarantee the influx of investments. In addition, they addressed the issue of attracting foreign investments to the tourism industry within the scope of public-private partnerships, as well as the issue of the creation of special economic zones of the tourist and recreational type. The authors concluded that it is necessary to form a clear political program for the development of tourism in the Russian Federation and to apply comprehensive measures to create conditions in which Russian tourism develops more effectively.

AB The article updates the tradition of studying the biographies of historical characters. Often, their names remain little known in academic and public spheres, and reference information about them is random and/or controversial. In this regard, the present study aims to attempt to reconstruct the life's path of Mikhail Fedorovich (1889-1934), a party and public figure, one of the organizers of Soviet industry. The legendary life of Shitov, a representative of the cohort of the so-called "Red directors" is analyzed in the context of the events of the national history of the first third of the 20th century, which included the revolutionary movement and the Civil War, the formation of the state of "dictatorship of the proletariat", a fundamental breakdown of the former multi-structured way of life, and the creation of the USSR military-industrial complex. The study is based on official regulations, documents of government agencies, political and public organizations, materials of the periodical press of the time, and sources of personal origin. The method of the study were the principles of historicism, objectivity and comprehensiveness, an anthropological approach, a biographical method. The study found that Shitov, born in the settlement Izhevsky Zavod of Sarapulsky District of Vyatka Province, managed to become a political figure and economic manager of the interregional level and later, in the early Soviet era of the 1920s - early 1930s, of the all-Union one. In the political sphere, he developed from a militant of the Lbovtsy, Ural guerrillas, during the First Russian Revolution of 1905-1907, an ideologist of the Izhevsk organization of the Union of Socialist-Revolutionaries Maximalists, a participant of the Izhevsk-Votkinsk Constituent Assembly Uprising to the Secretary of the Izhevsk District Committee of the RCP (b). In the production field, Shitov started as the head of the Central Library of the Izhevsk Plant and later became the chairman of the Votsk Regional Council of National Economy. Having shown outstanding organizational skills, he managed to enter into the cohort of "Red directors", was trained in the UK, and, in the early 1920s, headed the Kovrov Machine-Gun Plant in the most difficult time of the reconstruction of this enterprise. After two "party purges", Shitov remained among the party and economic leaders. Until his death in 1934, he headed the Pamyatinsk Machine Tractor Station in Belozersky District of Kurgan Oblast. The article not only analyzes Shitov's business qualities, but also shows his family's everyday life and describes his best character traits.

ID CONTEXT
AB The executive order of the President of the Russian Federation "On the Strategy for the Development of Health Care in the Russian Federation Until 2025" outlines significant challenges to national security in the field of public health along with positive indicators of the health care dynamics. These challenges include the dissatisfaction with the availability and quality of health care, the substitution of free health care by paid services, etc. Moreover, the need to activate social reserves of human capital and to ensure the conditions for the active longevity of the Russians becomes urgent in terms of the pension reform and the problem of the aging of the society. The spontaneously formed existing practices of the population's medical activity can hardly be called positive, i.e. contributing to the positive dynamics of the health status of an individual, the members of most social groups, and the society as a whole. The ideology of health and the culture of health care consumption have not yet been formed in Russian society. At least these two circumstances contribute to the intensification of social inequality among patients and potential patients ("pre-patients") in the access to health care. The relevance of the subject area of the article is determined by the need to overcome the existing differences in understanding the social connotation of medical care consumers' representations and its factors in terms of the transformation of the healthcare institution. The novelty of the research is determined by the use of the neoclassical model of scientific rationality and the methodology of sociological constructivism in the study of internal and external factors that determine the social representations on the healthcare model of the Russians. On the basis of empirical data across the South of Russia, the distinctive features of the two alternative types of social representations on the healthcare model liberal and conservative-are identified. However, in real life, social representations acquire a hybrid nature. The number of the hybrid type supporters is significant and heterogeneous by its composition. The representatives of this type recognize the necessity and inevitability of market regulators' intervention in the health sector, but suggest that there should be a package of guaranteed free aid and that the state should also bear the burden of financial expenses and responsibility for the quality and availability of medical care. Depending on the direction of the social expectations and demands of medical care consumers, the hybrid type of social representations may manifest itself as neoconservative or neoliberal, integrating the elements of conservative and liberal representations.

AB Introduction. Russia's National Projects focus on integrated interagency interactions between state and public participants. They accumulate various areas of social and political development of the territory. Mainstreaming the participation of the population in achieving the goals set consolidates and adjusts the vectors of change set by the National Projects. The purpose of the paper is to present a comprehensive analysis of the participation of the population in the implementation of the National Projects in a region on the basis of the study conducted, taking into account the characteristic features of the territory and the relevant forms of participation of local communities in accomplishing the stated tasks.
   Materials and Methods. The results of the "Kuzbass-Politics" monitoring initiative studies conducted in 2006 and 2018 were used as the materials for the analysis of this topic as well as the data of sociological surveys and reports on the implementation of the National Projects in Russia in 2019. To substantiate the implementation of the National Projects in the region, the method of systemic, structural and functional analysis was used.
   Results. The participation of the population in the implementation of the National Projects in a region has been analyzed using the example of the Kemerovo Region. The authors have studied the existing expenence of implementation of the National Projects in 2005-2007 and compared it with that of the current stage (2019-2024). The materials of the secondary analysis have shown that the content of the new National Projects is in line with the needs of the population in matters of improving their living arrangements: however, many people are distanced from the National Projects, which is expressed in the lack of awareness and limited participation. The authors point out that the implementation of the National Projects in a region can be carried out in a consolidated manner or have multidirectional vectors of application of the activity and resource potentials of the population.
   Discussion and Conclusion. The interaction between the authorities and the population is a dialogue in which the interests of the parties are reconciled in order to achieve a common goal. The lack of taking into account the active role of the population in the implementation of socially significant results affects the quality of the development and the conditions for the implementation of the National Projects. The results of the study can contribute to the development of regional programs and activities aimed at increasing people's participation in the implementation of the National Projects.

AB The article is dedicated to the analysis of the political consequences in Italy caused by 2020 Covid-19. The unexpected and hard pandemic has led not only to life losses, but has sent the impulse to the transformation of the Italian politics. An analysis of G. Conte government's actions is given. The effects of the pandemic in EU-Italy relations and Rome's foreign policy are analyzed. At the national level the main political outcome was the strengthening of confidence in prime minister G. Conte. Ultimately, this resulted in Conte's decision to create his own party. The fragmentation of political forces is increasing, parties are becoming more personified. This does not contribute to the stability of the political system. Today, the non-partisan Conte remains the country's most popular politician, while the most popular party is the League led by Salvini. The question of the stability of Conte's cabinet remains open, primarily due to the heterogeneity of the coalition. This will entail attempts to reform the country's Constitution to make the system more manageable. The main lesson for Italian foreign policy is the strengthening of the multivector policy, building bridges with other centers of power, not only with traditional Western partners, but also with Russia and China.

AB The article examines the professional development of a teacher in higher education based on the example of a powerlifting trainer in a specialized university sports center. The relevance of the research topic is determined by the need to resolve the issues of professional development of a powerlifting trainer of a specialized university sports center in modern social and economic conditions, characterized by the orientation of the government towards the modernization of additional education with particular emphasis on the quality of professional training, retraining, and advanced training of sports trainers. The issues of professional development of powerlifting trainers require a systemic psychological and pedagogical approach that also accounts for the cultural, social, and other patterns involved in personality development and determining the rules for the implementation of said development. The new times set new requirements for training professionals in powerlifting. Along with students, the trainer is considered one of the key subjects of activity in powerlifting. The assessment of the productivity of activity in powerlifting in the modern reality of world -level development and its socio-economic and political significance appears to be quite a complicated task both from a pragmatic viewpoint and in accordance with the main life, humanistic, and philosophical principles. The specific features of the social functions and professional activity of powerlifting trainers condition the problem of their professional development, which appears especially relevant. The essence of this development seems in a fundamental restructuring of the entire system of professional and pedagogical education based on the ideas and methods of other sciences.

AB The article is devoted to the analysis of legal aspects of the development of Russian constitutionalism. It is necessary to develop and improve conceptual ideas about the law so that the state can actively promote a legal ideology of constitutionalism containing moral potential. This implies the priority of individual rights and freedoms, separation of powers, political pluralism, and a high role of the court. The implementation of ideas and principles underlying any ideology is impossible without the existence of special subjects that guide society to achieve the tasks and goals defined by this ideology. The legal ideology as objectively existing and normatively fixed system of ideas, principles, and values predetermines the nature of the activity of the subjects. These subjects act as independent ideological institutions of Russian constitutionalism, as well as a set of norms, prescriptions, and requirements regulating a special kind of social relations, emerging in the sphere of establishment and recognition of ideology.

AB Since 9/11, terrorism has become a global issue of the twenty-first century. Terrorist organizations become important actors of world politics as they gain influence on political process and decision-making. Some organizations compete with each other in order to gain more power and influence. We study the distribution of power among terrorist groups using network approach and applying classic and new centrality indices (Short-Range (SRIC) and Long-Range interactions indices (LRIC)). These indices allow to identify terrorist groups with direct and indirect influence on the terrorist network.

DT Article
DE science; re-enchantment of world; vocation; gift; ethics of science
AB The article discusses the ethical principles of the functioning of science in society and the rational grounds for the ethics of science. These questions are raised in connection with the idea of vocation-as-a-gift expressed by Ilya Kasavin. Kasavin suggests that we should not seek a rational justification for the privileged position of science in society, but accept this position as a favour and grace. Kasavin's concept is considered in the context of the Weberian distinction between profession and vocation. It is shown that the phenomenon of vocation-as-a-gift should be correlated with what Weber calls substantive rationality, contrasting it with formal rationality. As opposed to formal rationality, which is embodied in science with its universal quantitative method of knowledge, substantive rationality belongs to what is traditionally called common sense, i.e., the ability to perceive the qualitative uniqueness of things and events in the world and build behavior based on qualitative "gestalts". Substantive rationality is closely related to the charismatic type of authority, which can be distributed among social aggregates and social institutions to the extent to which they represent the collective realization of subjective meanings. In a disenchanted world dominated by formal-rational relationships, the charismatic type of authority is pushed to the periphery of social life. Science is determined through the coefficient of its economic and technological efficiency, which causes the gradual transformation of its social role: from a vocation it turns into a profession. Based on this Weberian scheme, we should recognize that Kasavin's appeal to the romantic figure of a charismatic scientist looks like an illegitimate restoration of an archaic type of social action; and the technoscientific world of formal rationality has no request for it, or this request is strongly marginalized. However, Kasavin's concept can be better understood in the context of re-enchantment of the world. This new phenomenon indicates that science and technology today provide us with the resources to overthrow such idols of modernity as objectivism, positivism, scientism, etc., i.e., to overcome formal rationality. Under these conditions, the charismatic type of authority acquires a new legitimacy.

DE public administration; civil service personnel; personnel potential;
   recruiting; channels of recruitment; recruitment practices; young
   generation of politicians; political leaders
AB The article is devoted to the issue of recruiting young political leaders in modern Russia. This issue is relevant due to the fact that today, despite the large number of officials in the country, there is a certain personnel shortage at all levels of government and thus a need for effective managers who are able to strategically think and work in a system of changes. All this necessitates the establishment and development of an institution of youth political elites, which is able to provide governing bodies at different levels with youth leaders and qualified personnel. At the same time, the current tendency to rejuvenate the political elite is largely the consequence of the rejection of the need to go through all the nomenclature stages, the presence of certain resources in young people or their manifestation of activity, but not the result of a systematic work in this direction. This necessitates a scientific understanding of the problem of training political leaders among young people and a systematizing of the process of their recruitment. The aim of this study is to identify and summarize existing practices, forms, channels of search and selection of young people, technologies for developing their leadership potential, integration into the political elite of the country. The object of the analysis is the process of recruiting young political leaders. The theoretical and methodological research platform is a political and psychological approach that allows integrating various provisions of the social sciences and applies psychological knowledge to analyze the stated problem in the subject field of political science. During the study, the authors analyzed the existing forms of support for youth initiatives and the recruitment of young leaders; technologies, methods and tools for the search, selection, development and support of young political leaders, channels and practices for their recruitment. The analysis was based on information from the websites of political parties, youth movements and organizations, youth public institutions, state and municipal authorities, as well as from recent research articles on recruitment issues. The results obtained indicate the need for the optimization and systematization of the recruiting process. Therefore, as conclusions, the authors justify the need for annual monitoring in this direction, speak about the need for the young political elite to form a system of national values and symbols, as well as an ideological foundation. The authors conclude about the need to create a unified system of training, retraining, and advanced training for young politicians, as well as the need for the formation of the civic identity and patriotic behavior of young politicians. It is proposed to achieve the latter through their active involvement in political activity at the municipal, regional, and federal levels.

AB The article is devoted to the empirical diagnostics of the similarities and differences between activists of pro-government and opposition youth movements in contemporary Russia. The analysis of recent scientific literature leads the author to the idea that, after increasing the political activity of Russian youth in 2017-2019, scientific interest in the analysis of its political participation has increased. However, despite the large number of scientific projects in this area, some important questions about the political activity of contemporary Russian youth remain unanswered. One of these complicated questions is the level of difference between the young Russians involved in the political actions of pro-government youth movements and those involved in the work of opposition movements. The rhetoric and the activity of such movements look obviously different. But is it enough to say that they are supported by extremely different young people? Besides, the analysis of previous research works in other countries shows that sometimes differences between activists of different (and even conflicting) youth movements can be quite relative. The literature describes cases in which young people with very similar motives and beliefs became activists of conflicting youth movements. So, the initial hypothesis of the study is the idea that the differences between activists of pro-government and opposition movements in contemporary Russia can be exaggerated, and that their activity can be based on a similar system of incentives. Testing this hypothesis in the course of his own sociological research, the author comes to the conclusion that not only differences, but also similarities can indeed be traced between activists of pro-government and opposition movements in contemporary Russia. Despite the fact that activists of pro-government and opposition movements prefer different forms of political activity, have different ideas about the ideal development of society and have different ideological preferences, they often have common reasons for their interest in political activity. Activists of both pro-government and opposition movements relate their interest in politics with value motives: the desire to achieve social justice or to fulfill a civic duty. So, there is a difference in vectors and forms of their political activity. But the initial nature of this activity is similar.

ID POWER
AB The article analyzes China's attempts to confront the EU's normative power by the example of Italy joining the "Belt and Road Initiative" on March 23, 2019. The author claims that the signing of a memorandum of cooperation between Italy and China was not so much economic as political for both countries and for the European Union as a whole, which was the reason for the public criticism from Brussels of the actions of the Italian leadership. The author concludes that the political significance of the event for China lies in an attempt to publicly "overcome" the EU normative power, and for Italy, in an effort to uphold the principle of national sovereignty and position itself as an actor within the European Union, capable of influencing the process of formation of the EU normative power in interaction with third countries. At the same time, the case of Italy demonstrates that in opposing the EU normative power, the PRC uses a certain discursive strategy, which is to form a social network of trust within the country and increase the amount of social capital to a level that can influence the political decision-making process. The Italian "government of change" in this case turned out to be the most "convenient" partner, since from the very beginning it has built conflict discourse with Brussels, upholding the principle of national sovereignty in foreign and domestic policy, and thereby undermining the effectiveness of the EU normative power. Thus, the signing of the memorandum reveals the weakening of the normative force of the European Union, the effectiveness of which is being questioned not only by the "new" EU members, but also by the political leadership of one of the founding states of the Union. This reflects a very real risk that the development of the ideas of "sovereignty" can harm the EU's international activity.

AB Major international events contribute to guiding IR scholarship's interests, yet it remains surprisingly unexplored how transformative political events affect international relations as an academic field. This article focuses on the linkage between key global moments and the institutional factors that condition IR scholarship, focusing on the important yet under-explored intervening elements in the interrelation between political events and academic practice. The article defines the utility of such focus and illustrates it with case studies of three central parties to the Cold War conflict: Russia as representative of the Eastern bloc, Canada of the Western alliance, and Switzerland as a neutral polity. This article shows how institutional factors such as funding schemes, the marketization of education, and the creation of new IR departments operate as effective "hinges" exerting significant influence over the ways scholars develop ideas about international relations. `

AB This article studies the famine of 1921-1922 and 1932-1933 in the Southern Russian regions. Famine as a socio-historical phenomenon is considered in the context of the relationship of state power, the Cossacks, and the Church. The authors reveal the general and special features of the famine emergence and analyze the differences in the state policies of 1921-1922 and 1932-1933. Considerable attention is paid to the survival strategies of the Don, Kuban and Terek populations. Slaughtering and eating draft animals, transfer from the state places of work to the private campaigns and cooperatives, moving to shores and banks, and eating river and sea food became widespread methods of overcoming famine. Asocial survival strategies included cannibalism, abuse of powers, bribery, and more. In 1921-1922, the Russian Orthodox Church fought actively against the famine. In 1932-1933, the Church was weakened and could not provide significant assistance to the starving population. The article was written based on declassified documents from the state and departmental archives, including criminal investigations and analytical materials of the Obedinjonnoe gosudarstvennoe politicheskoe upravlenie (Joint State Political Directorate] (OGPU) recording the attitudes of minds. Also used are personal stories-namely, interviews with eyewitnesses of the famine of 1932-1933, recorded by the Kuban folklorists in the territory of the Krasnodar and Stavropol Krai.

   Russian-Chinese relations
AB The circle of the most acute problems facing the Chinese leadership remains unchanged: relations with the United States, domestic political stability, economic growth, etc. However, by the beginning of 2020, the priority structure of these topics had changed. Prospects for completing the so-called "first stage" of the bilateral trade deal between China and the United States and signing the corresponding agreement were outlined. Trade deal was done on January 15, 2020. The decrease in trade tensions highlighted the growing Sino-American confrontation on other topics: military construction in China, the human rights situation in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous region, and the struggle for control of the world's 5G space, which appears to be of long-term strategic importance. Against the background of some easing of trade relations between the P.R.C. and the U.S. by the beginning of 2020, the topic of Hong Kong is gaining new urgency. In Hong Kong, the Chinese leadership continues to face a dilemma: go for a military action or use peaceful mechanisms. By the beginning of 2020, it seems that the "non-forceful approach" is still steadily prevailing. At the end of 2019, the United States took a number of steps to put legal pressure on Beijing on the Hong Kong issue. The U.S. laws S. 1838 "On Human Rights and Democracy in Hong Kong" and H.R. 4270 "On Restrictions on the Export of Tear Gas and Crowd Control Technologies to Hong Kong" should be considered from the viewpoint of the global political and economic rivalry between the United States and China. In general, these laws are primarily aimed at improving the effectiveness of the U. S. tariff and sanctions policy against China. The topic of economic growth becomes a priority for the Chinese leadership. GDP growth in 2019 slowed slightly to 6.1%, but was in the "planned fork" of 6.0-6.5%. In this context, discussions about "optimal rates" of economic growth are beginning to intensify again in the P.R.C. One part of economists continues to argue that China should keep economic growth at the 6% mark "at all costs". Opponents of this approach speak of the so-called "new normality", in the sense that it is important to focus not so much on the pace as on the quality of economic development indicators. From December 10 to 12, 2019, the Central Meeting on Economic Work was held in Beijing, during which clear requirements were put forward in relation to the economic development of China in 2020. The main leitmotif is stability and quality of growth. By the beginning of 2020, Russian-Chinese relations have established trends that are likely to determine the direction of bilateral relations in the short term. Beijing and Moscow will demonstrate the strengthening of their strategic partnership in every possible way. On the other hand, Russia and China will try to muffle existing differences and contradictions. In strategic cooperation, Beijing does not agree to establish a military alliance with Moscow and refuses to participate in multilateral negotiations on nuclear missile issues, including the issue of medium- and shorter-range missiles.

The EU is considered as the basic component of the European direction of Russia's foreign policy in the context of profound changes in the international arena, which in a concentrated form reflect the complex dialectics of the interconnection between the old and the new, the conjugation of national, regional and global in world politics. The crisis elements in world political processes extremely actualize the resource potential and possibilities of long-term partnership and cooperation between Russia and the EU. Assessing the prospects of a competitive partnership and exploring the complexity of interaction, the author concludes that in the radically changed environment the demand for strategic partnership on both sides remains unchanged.

ID INTEGRATION
AB This article examines the notion of a "Greater Europe" in Russian foreign policy from the 1990s to the present. The idea developed as the Russian government sought to establish its national and civilizational identy in the wake of the USSR's dissolution. At the turn of the 21st century, Moscow embraced the idea of a rapprochement with the rest of Europe. Pursuing the notion of "Greater Europe," to create a single continental economic, political and cultural space, became a major diplomatic objective as it developed a strategic partnership with the European Union. However, in more recent years its outlook on the world has changed. Furthermore, after relations with Brussels deteriorated in the wake of the Ukrainian crisis and the latter's imposition of sanctions has also affected Russian foreign policy. This article considers the emergence and evolution of the idea of a "Greater Europe", and examines possible ways to realize this ambition. It argues that a EAEU-EU "combination" could become a basis for implementing this concept. However, any potential rapprochement can only be possible when the political barriers the EU established in its relations with Russia and the EAEU are removed.

DT Article
DE expert knowledge; testimony; testimonial knowledge; epistemic
   disagreement
ID EPISTEMIC AUTHORITY; TRANSMISSION; TESTIMONY
AB The article considers the problem of trust in experts as knowers. The problem is construed in the light of the affirmation and criticism of expert knowledge in the political aspect. J. Brennan seeks to show the need for a political system in which only epistemically competent agents may participate in political life. The reason for his argument is that nowadays the peopl e (Americans) are mostly uneducated to be able to make political decisions, which could have grave consequences. In contrast, the concept of expert examination is criticized, this criticism seeks to deprive experts of political authority and thereby p rotect the egalitarian democratic system. These argument patterns reproduce similar stances endorsed by Plato and Aristotle, who respectively promoted the rule of knowers and the rule of polis as ensemble of citizens, not only experts. In particular, the arguments of J. Reiss are examined, which emphasize the disagreement among experts and the bias of experts. As the author argues, these arguments reproduce the thoughts of Sextus Empiricus against the trust in the sage. Given the general direction of such criticism, an argument is also brought showing the possibility of deception on the part of experts as a basis for mistrust (Section 1). In the face of such a problematic field, the author wants to show the grounds for epistemic trust in exper ts and avert these objections, based on the results of analytic social epistemologists. Expert knowledge is based on the concepts "testimony" and "epistemic authority", which are discussed in Section 2. Two approaches to evidence are presented in the light of the apparent antinomy of authority and autonomy. Based on the arguments of Linda Zagzebski, it is shown that the epistemic agent has sufficient grounds for trusting the testimonies of other people, since epistemic egoism as an extreme version of autonomy significantly limits our knowledge, and also since we are warranted to trust the test imony of epistemic authority if this allows us to better achieve our epistemic goals. Section 3 presents the concept and criteria of an expert put forward by Alvin Goldman, which help distinguish a true expert from a false one. These criteria presuppose an expert community that allows monitoring the activities of experts and depriving them of their expert status in case of violation of research e thics. In particular, it is emphasized in Section 4 that the possibility of disagreement is a condition of trust in experts, since it allows to identify errors and abuses by experts.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB The article reveals the migration processes characteristic of the whole of Russia, including in the village. The migration policy of the regions is one of the key elements of the social development of society, taking into account the economic, political and demographic features of the territory; it determines the direction of migration processes and the formation of migratory connection. The migration process in rural areas (territories) acts as a two-way movement - as a stream of departures and as a stream of arrivals. The article provides basic statistics on migration in the region for 2014-2018.
   The aim of the study is to analyze the migration situation in rural areas (territories) of the Udmurt Republic, one of the regions of the Russian Federation, since these processes directly affect the state of the labor market. In this regard, it seems relevant to study migration processes in rural areas (territories) of the Udmurt Republic. The object of research is the processes of migration in the context of modern international relations.
   The subject of the study is - migration processes in rural areas; at the same time, migration is considered in comparison with labor market indicators in addition to traditional indicators of migration growth (decrease) in the population.
   In accordance with this goal, the main task was determined: to offer statistical indicators characterizing migration in terms of the labor market and the quality of life of rural areas. Methods of comparison, grouping, systematization, analysis of dependence were used.
   It is concluded that these calculation methods can be applied to determine target indicators of the municipal policy of the region.

AB The article discusses the problem of connection between the history of philosophy and intellectual history. The author analyses the development of the models of relations between the history of thought and the history of philosophy in time, problematises the most urgent historiographical questions, actualizes the modern situation of interaction between intellectual history and the history of philosophy. It is emphasized that in spite of the attempts to separate from historical knowledge, from the imperatives of the history of thought, the history of philosophy is still related to them at each stage of its development, in each of its methodological turn. The author discusses the current situation of interaction between intellectual history and the history of philosophy in the context of world tradition. The main questions are: "What do historians of philosophy get within the framework of the perspective of intellectual history?" and "How does this relation methodologically enrich the history of philosophy?" At the present stage, intellectual history is a problem field that allows the history of philosophy to make a transition from the problematisation of the history of the history of philosophy to the problematisation of the philosophy of the history of philosophy and contributes to the development of philosophical historiography. The author analyses the methodological problems of text and context, the historicity and extra-historicity of philosophical truth, the verification of historical and philosophical interpretation. The dilemma of text and context prompted the development of the hermeneutic history of philosophy in Germany; the discussion of the problem of verifying historical and philosophical interpretation led to discussions about anachronism in the Anglo-American world. The contradiction between the historicity and extra-historicity of philosophy launched the development of the philosophy of the history of philosophy in France. Regardless of the national tradition, for historians of philosophy, intellectual history has become a field to problematise their own practice. The central author's thesis is that the appeal to intellectual history is the possibility for the procedural updating of the history of philosophy and the most logical (in the context of the modem time) way for the cultivation of self-consciousness of historians of philosophy and the development of historiography.

AB From December 6 to 7, 2019, the international conference, "Philosophy of Early Christianity in the Era of Digitalization," was held at Fu Jen Catholic University in the capital of Taiwan, Taipei, with the participation of sociologists from the Saint Tikhon Orthodox Humanitarian University.
   Currently, all developed countries are evolving the digitalization process. It goes without saying that this is reflected in the economy. Today, even traditionally offline sectors of the national economy are increasingly using cloud computing, big data, and the Internet of things. At the same time, the process of digitalization cannot be reduced solely to the development of the digital economy, since it affects all significant areas of society's life-social, political, and cultural.
   Some researchers believe that the digitalization process affects not only the social but also the personal sphere of the individual and brings about a changein needs, whereby the need for information exchange becomes basic.
   In this regard, the risks of the digitalization process should be noted: technological (artificial intelligence can get out of control); economic (the risk of unemployment due to automation and the substitution of artificial intelligence for a number of professions, on the one hand, and the risk of a shortage of qualified personnel necessary for the development of the digital economy on the other); socio-political (including the risk of escalation of cyber wars between countries); and finally the moral risk, which is the dehumanization of consciousness.
   The speakers at the conference, representatives of both European and Asian universities, endeavored to understand the trends in the development of the social process of digitalization from the positions of early Christian thinkers.
   The conference showed the need to study the social process of digitalization in the framework of an interdisciplinary approach at the international level.

DE Europeanisation; nationalism; space industries; human spaceflight;
   international Space Station
AB In recent years, the fields of political economy and economic sociology have seen the emergence of research focussed on the 'political work' of industries: industrial products can embed domestic policies and feelings of national belonging. This article analyses the way in which space industries materialise national expression among European states as examples of the tensions between Europeanisation and nationalism. Three roles that are endorsed by space industries are discussed. First, space industries act as a support to an idealtype of Europe, shared by the two institutional frames of European space policy: the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Union (EU). Second, while the ESA and the EU maintain relationships characterised alternately by independency, division of labour, or competition, this bicephalic framework leads to the deployment of a European claim to sovereignty and autonomy on the international stage. Third, space industries affiliated with an ESA member state can also be turned into instruments of national leadership at the expense of European unity. While space industries remain overlooked in the literature on European policies, emphasising industries illustrates that 'unity in diversity', claimed in the will of Europeanisation by European institutions, reinvents itself through an industrial sector where nationalist strategies remain strong.

AB This paper is an attempt to try and understand the processes and interactions that take place in society when a group attempts to lobby in favor of contentious forms of public policy, which may not necessarily be in national or public interest, through the political marketing lens. What are the necessary environmental conditions in society and political tactics employed that could be sufficient to try and influence and persuade a public to accept a form of security policy or military intervention? Two cases are used to try and investigate these questions - the NATO debate in Sweden and the 2015 Parliamentary debate in the United Kingdom on using military force in Syria. In spite of the differences in the two individual cases, a number of similarities in outcomes emerge. One of the requisite underlying environmental conditions is that the publics concerned need to perceive an immediate security threat to themselves. Political tactics used tend to revolve around intangible value and norm laden emotional argumentation. These are, to some extent, further influenced by the historical experience and memory of the public in historical accounts of armed conflict.

AB Ethnographic conceptualism takes its cue from conceptual art and uses artistic interventions as an anthropological research tool. The term 'ethnographic conceptualism' was coined to sum up the method of the exhibition project Gifts to Soviet Leaders (Kremlin Museum, Moscow 2006) as simultaneously a reflection on the vast and complex economy of public gifts to heads of Soviet state, a distinctly post-Soviet political and cultural artefact, and as a tool for ethnography of post-socialism. This article explores ethnographic conceptualism's contribution to performativity theory. I look at how it makes visible the tension between what such projects perform and describe. In doing so, I use ethnographic conceptualism as a vantage point to revisit the foundational distinction of performativity theory between the constative and performative statements (Austin). Drawing in this artistic and research method, I redefine the performative, not as a domain or a type of utterance that is distinct from the constative, but as an act of drawing this distinction.

AB Do voters punish governments more severely during international economic crises or do they discount exogenous shocks as they recognize the government's limited "room of manoeuvre"? The current literature provides conflicting answers to this question. This study argues that in such contexts citizens' economic perceptions are less likely to predict their sanctioning behavior but that, nonetheless, governments experience a higher cost of ruling. We show that in the paradigmatic case of Italy, government popularity during the Great Recession, while being hardly explained by economic evaluations, suffers a stronger decline as a function of time in office. We account for this increased cost of ruling by economic policy debates and other political events, such as cabinet crises and large-scale scandals.

AB The study objective is searching ways to transform the current world order and to overcome negative modern trends, resulting in social discrepancy, escalation of contractions between rich and poor, social and political instability increase, extremism and terrorism of planetary scale. Along with investigating precariation as a result of sporadic globalization process, the article deals with other global problems, such as mass population poverty, migration level increase, drastic polarization of living standards in countries with developed, developing and underdeveloped economies. The research is based on historical approach applying methods of logical structure, situational, and comparative analysis. Statistical data allowed the authors to conclude that regardless of regulating conditions of precariation development, this phenomenon becomes mass-scale and insurmountable without fundamental transformation of current world management. The obtained conclusions and recommendations can be applied in transforming social structure of society. To overcome precariation objective conditions are needed: unification of all nations on the basis of unconditioned human values, consolidation of natural resources as all-human wealth, abolition of the existing states as sovereign political entities. The first step should ensure formation of Unified world social and political organization basing on confederation principle, and agreed by the states. The second step is to build up global federation with division of powers between the subjects (former states) and Global Federal Center. Strategic objective of planetary executive authorities and Global Government should be to provide security, effective use of global resources to enhance economy, to overcome the gap of underdeveloped countries, to improve living standards, to eliminate precariation and poverty around the world.

The new authorities faced the task of preserving and enhancing the dignities of the Soviet state. It was possible to do this only by maintaining a belief in an advanced idea that already needed updating and adjustment. It is mentioned that this task has not been solved. Political figures came to power, who, instead of a creative attitude to the Stalinist heritage and, thereby, forward movement, turned in the opposite direction, initiating de-Stalinization. The course towards de-Stalinization was the source of the violation monolithic structure of the state. "The khrushchev's thaw" is characterized as a harbinger of future period of Gorbachev's "perestroika", which led to the great country disintegration.

DE China; North Korea; cooperation; rhetoric of unbreakable friendship
AB China's relations with North Korea occupy a significant place in the foreign policy structure of North-East Asia.
   The author believes that if by the end of 2017 the relations between the two countries revealed a clear trend to their cooling, since 2018, thanks to a combination of factors, such as the "Olympic warming", increased confrontation between China and the United States and the skillful maneuver of the North Korean leadership, it becomes possible to speak about a reversal of the parties to cooperate. Thus has begun a new stage in bilateral relations.
   The period under review was marked by a high level of political contacts between the two states, including four trips by Kim Jong-Un to China and the first state visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to North Korea. But although the rhetoric of the traditional and unchanging friendship between the two socialist countries and the two parties has not changed, it can be noted that if China positions itself as the first friend of the DPRK, Pyongyang tries to maintain some distance. In the new year's speech of 2019 and other statements, Kim Jong Un does not single out the relationship between the DPRK and the PRC in a separate paragraph, mentioning the relationship of the DPRK with the socialist camp in general.
   China is using the situation to strengthen the North Korea's forced economic dependence and deepen mutual economic ties: in 2019, China accounted for 92 % of all North Korea's foreign trade.
   China welcomes the DPRK's dialogue with the US and South Korea, but its main focus is on preventing instability in the region, rather than actually denuclearizing it. In addition, the current status quo corresponds to the Russian-Chinese proposal for a "double freeze"(1).
   So, relations between China and North Korea can be described as a tactical alliance, due to a common threat originating from the United States and its allies. But as long as Pyongyang's course of detente continues, and the threat from the US is considered to be weighty, the "unchangeable friendship" will continue.

AB During the last decades countries of the South Caucasus region have developed their own perception of political priorities, national identity. State interests of each of these countries are still to a large extent connected to Russia, but the context of relationship has changed, which requires new mechanisms of cooperation. The article explores the issue of political actorness of smaller states and peculiar features of their relation with global actors. It is concluded that the demand of political elites has grown beyond economic and political interests. The subject of research is contemporary foreign policy of Georgia that, through different time periods, has been balancing between priority of cooperation with Russia and Western countries. Despite the dominant Western direction in Georgia's development, the argument is put forward that the trend for multi-vector policy will persist. The priority dimension for Russia should be creation and preservation of sustainable long-term channels of cooperation that would not depend on internal structural changes in Georgia.

DT Article
DE politics of memory; the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth; Kresy;
   collective memory; political mythology
AB The eastern frontier of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth is referred to in the Polish language as the Kresy. The geographical extent of this area changed with the shifting borders of the Polish-Lithuanian state and, after 1918, of Poland alone. At the time when modern Polish national consciousness was being shaped, it denoted the Russian territory known as the "western provinces" (gubernias)." Beginning with the mid-19th century, the Kresy were primarily a concept of the Polish political vocabulary that referred to an axiological space. The dispute over the area took the shape of a cultural and civilizational confrontation between two projects, those of imperial Russia and Poland. This article presents the Polish perception of the Kresy mostly as an imagined, not a real area. In the author's view, in order to explain it one has to employ categories of memory studies. The conflict over the Kresy took place when Polish national consciousness was being formed under the influence of Romanticism. This led to the permanent inclusion of Kresy mythology and to the conviction about the existential nature of the conflict with Russia in the Polish memory. The existence of the Kresy as a historical phenomenon ceased with the end of the Second World War. The area, however, continues to play an important role in memory and imagination. The author notes the most important threads of discussions on the Kresy heritage in public life. Attention is also paid to the renewed interest that the discourse on the Eastern Borderland has enjoyed in official Polish politics of memory in recent years.

DT Article
DE elections; opposition; electoral behavior; tactical voting; protest

AB The article is devoted to the study of the results of the 2019 Moscow City Duma election campaign and the impact of the "smart voting" strategy proposed by A.Navalny. The authors suggest that a high assessment of this strategy, which is often associated with the relative success of the opposition in Moscow elections, is emotional rather than scientific, and test the validity of this strategy using statistical and correlation analysis. They interpret "smart voting" as a kind of tactical voting, which has a completely different nature than a protest vote.
   The authors measure a quantitative effect of protest and tactical voting by comparing the level of support for candidates in the 2019 Moscow City Duma and its previous elections, examine significant correlations between various indicators and evaluate possible effects of voter turnout, level of competition and the electoral potential of the district on voting outcomes. After that they conclude that the success of the opposition can be explained by the combination of two factors: the increase in protest sentiments, which reduced the electoral base of the pro-government nominees, and the decrease in the level of competition inside the opposition, due to both the "smart voting" strategy and disqualification of candidates. These factors largely ensured the flow of votes away from the administrative candidates and weak opposition members to the most powerful opposition candidates, thereby contributing to their victory. "Smart voting" contributed to this victory, but did not determine the overall outcome of the elections. Its quantitative effect amounted to 5.6% of the vote, while the effect of the protest vote was 9.7%. Moreover, while "smart voting" played a decisive role in the victory of several candidates, it deprived of victory approximately the same number of opposition representatives who were not able to confront two competitors simultaneously.

AB The article deals with the major trends of modern Russian political metaphorology (2011-2020): cognitive, rhetorical, discursive, and semiotic. The cognitive trend considers political metaphor as a mental phenomenon that can be verbally represented in political texts. The cognitive direction includes four methods of political metaphor analysis: 1) analysis of solitary conceptual metaphors; 2) analysis of metaphors united by the source domain of metaphorical expansion; 3) analysis of metaphors united by the target domain of metaphorical expansion; 4) analysis of metaphorical projections in conceptual integrated spaces.
   The rhetorical trend focuses on the analysis of political metaphor as a pragmatic tool of influence on the addressee. The rhetorical approach to political metaphors involves research of the system of political arguments, strategies and tactics of rhetorical persuasion, the development of the methodology of rhetorical analysis and the construction of theoretical models of argumentation. This approach traditionally considers the metaphor as one of the stylistic means that politicians use in the struggle for power in various genres of political communication.
   The discursive trend involves the study of metaphor in a wide extra-linguistic context in different types of political discourse. There is a tendency to reduce the role of critical discourse analysis, which was so popular in political metaphorology at the beginning of the 21st century.
   The semiotic trend studies metaphor as an attribute of the sign system in the political life of society. There is a growing interest of linguists in multimodal imagery, which is associated with the understanding that non-verbal means are not inferior in pragmatic potential to the verbal tools. The peculiarity of the study of non-verbal metaphors is that researchers more often choose a method for studying the target domain of metaphorical expansion.
   The most general tendencies of modern Russian political metaphorology are highlighted, which include interdisciplinarity, methodological pluralism, criticism of universalism, emphasis on the cultural specifics of communication and its discursive characteristics, as well as the convergence of rhetorical and cognitive methodology. On the one hand, the paper emphasizes trends common to Russian and foreign metaphorology, and on the other, it reveals the characteristics reflecting the continuation of the traditions of Russian science.

DE Academy of sciences of the USSR; history of science; Soviet Union; state
   and science; secrecy; isolationism
AB Since 1917 the Russian Academy of Sciences had been under intense pressure of the state, and from 1947 the pressure on the Academy of sciences of the USSR increased due to some new ideological campaigns in the internal policy adopted in the late Stalin Soviet Union, which affected a large number of scholars in all fields of science. Introduction of total secrecy in all kinds of scientific researches and resorting to isolationism as a basic trend of development of Soviet science caused inner opposition in the scientific milieu: in spite of the pressure from non-scientific bureaucratic institutions, Soviet scholars sought ways to continue regular research work, and sometimes this resistance proved to be effective. As a result, scientific councils of the institutes in Humanities and Social sciences of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR were given the right to decide independently whether a work had to be examined for secrecy or not. This opened up opportunities for publication of the majority of works by historians, philologists and other scholars in Humanities of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. Of course, the situation was far from ideal; party and ideological supervision over scientists was rigid, but scientists managed to defend the principle of scientific nature of their work. This article provides some previously unpublished documents from the Archive of the Russian Academy of Sciences and Russian State Archive of Social-Political History, letters to Soviet leaders (I. V. Stalin, L. P. Beria, G. M. Malenkov).

ID PRECARIAT
AB The growing public demand for profound changes in social life makes the issues of nature, causes, driving forces, forms and methods of struggle for change and against them especially acute. These are fundamental problems of social sciences, and addressing them becomes a reason to recall the theoretical legacy of V.I. Ulyanov, updating formal reason for such an appeal - the 150th anniversary of the birth of this thinker. Critically analyzing the legacy of Lenin, the author of the article highlights, firstly, the relevance of the study of material, lying in the field of social production, and economic relations, the foundations of social structuring of society, values, motives and behavior patterns of social groups and people, on the one hand; the role of social actors as creators of history, on the other. At the same time, emphasis is placed on the study of historically specific conditions (stages of development of society) and social contradictions in these interactions. Secondly, the Leninist theory of classes is developing (including the theory of not only inter- but also intra-class contradictions, the historical diffusion of classes, their transformation, etc.), as well as the class struggle in the whole variety of its forms (from class compromises to reforms and revolutions) and types, including the struggle of the bourgeoisie against employed workers. Thirdly, it is shown that a social study of the problem of reforms (counter-reforms) and revolutions (counter-revolutions) in modern conditions is becoming highly urgent, and that the deep eco-socio-humanitarian oriented changes that are in demand today can become a reality only subject to the activation of socialist and communist socio-political actors.

TI THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY: AN INTERDISCIPLINARY
   APPROACH
SO VESTNIK PERMSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-JURIDICHESKIE NAUKI
LA Russian
DT Article
DE proportionality principle; constitutional rights; constitutional
   adjudication; interdisciplinary approach
ID 3RD
AB Introduction: proportionality is an object of study in various fields of knowledge, with each discipline only focusing on particular aspects of this phenomenon. General scientific and legal aspects of proportionality are not to be mixed up. However, the interdisciplinary approach allows going beyond a strictly formal (legal) approach and seeing new dimensions of proportionality. Methods: the author argues that the application of an exclusively dogmatic approach in legal research is not capable of solving the complex issues of society, including the most difficult problem of balancing public and private interests. Therefore, in this paper, interdisciplinary methodology is used to provide a deeper analysis of the constitutional principle of proportionality. Purpose: interdisciplinary analysis of proportionality is geared not only to theoretical goals but also to applied tasks. In this regard, an attempt was made to link the interdisciplinarity approach with the judicial practice of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation. In accordance with this goal, the study is to solve three main tasks. The first part of the paper aims to identify the essential characteristics of the constitutional principle of proportionality; the author refers to philosophy, logic, psychology and ethics. In the second part, the idea of proportionality is analyzed through the prism of linguistics. Linguistic aspects are important when interpreting proportionality in its judicial sense in cases on the protection of constitutional rights. The third part analyzes proportionality in such fields as economics, sociology and political science from the perspective of finding a possible balance between constitutional rights of individuals and public interests. Results: the author justifies that only interconnection of various aspects of the interdisciplinary approach is meaningful in the analysis of proportionality. Each of the aspects cannot be applied separately. Conclusions: in constitutional adjudication, a combination of various interdisciplinary approaches is necessary depending on the circumstances of the case. Such a conclusion should not deny the value of legal dogmatics in application to the proportionality analysis. However, the latter topic deserves further research.

DT Article
DE national state identity; political perception; image of the country;

AB The article is based on the results of a study into Russian citizens' perception of Russia and other countries, conducted by the Department of Political Sociology and Psychology, Faculty of Political Science, Lomonosov Moscow State University. The purpose of the study is to identify if patterns form regarding figurative and symbolic idiosyncrasies into how Russian citizens perceive both their country and others, and such countries' interaction in the global sphere. Studying the content and structural features of these ideas, we can determine the nature and degree of how crystallized these ideas have become in national-state identity. The study is based on a comprehensive analytical model involving the study of three aspects of the perception of Russia's place in the modern world. The first is the idea of Russia: the spatial and temporal characteristics that serve as a reflection of the respondents' self-identification as a Russian citizen. The second is a system of images and symbols representing the respondents' ideas about the global sphere, the role of states and regions in it, and the features of their interaction and mutual influence. The third is a symbolic representation of how individual countries can be perceived through their relations with Russia. The empirical research methodology is based on a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods: formalized interviews, projective techniques. The research model developed revealed not only the relationship between the spatial and temporal aspects of the perception process, but also their place in the structure of personality identity. Respondents' national-state identification is reflected in the assessments of their country next to others, determines the perception of Russia's place in the world as a subjective factor, and forms the image of the past and future.

DT Article
DE intersectionalism; utopia; dystopia; post-capitalism
AB The article attempts to identify a true role that intersectional discourses and intersectional political movements play in modern societies. The feeling of moral and intellectual superiority experienced by the traditional left with respect to the "primitive" concepts of intersectionalists - is it false? To what extent does intersectionism, often ideologically painted with leftist tints, but subjected to fierce criticism from both the right and the left, correlate with the contemporary projects of the post-capitalist future?
   According to the author, the seemingly far-fetched intersectionalists' concepts and the ensued practices, no matter how unpleasant it may sound to profound left theorists, represent an attempt to pay off their debts. First of all, this is about the concept that capitalism cannot be overcome until it reaches sufficient maturity i.e., inter alia, until anthropological and cultural consequences that it promises as an "ideal type" fully unfold. Capitalism is doomed to eradicate the preceding forms of oppression and enslavement of people, replacing them with its own forms - more advanced, more cynical, but somewhat less painful, because they are not covered by all kinds of hypocrisy. Therefore, unless the obstacles to the realization of this emancipatory capitalist (dys)topia are removed, it is impossible to be serious about any type of socialism, communism, or even "post-capitalism". The article shows that it is intersectionism that is currently removing such obstacles, while the concepts of transition to "post-capitalism" represent a weak alternative to intersectionism, remaining merely a rational myth of a cabal of intellectuals.

DE working class; political subject; new working class; political

AB The authors consider the new working class as consisting of both industrial workers and employed in the service sector. The article aims at identifying changes in the social-political status of the new working class and at describing the civil-political component of its political subjectivity. The authors attempt to theoretically reconstruct the idea of the working class as a political subject. The first part of the article presents conceptual approaches to the analysis of the working class as a political subject. The authors identify three periods: 1) classical works that laid the foundation for the study of the working class as a political subject and its special historical role; 2) studies of the marginal political status of the working class in Western countries, when leading theorists described the transformation of workers into an object of manipulation in the era of mass communications and the widespread consumerism ideology; 3) works of contemporary authors (including the new working class studies) opposing the policy of the traditional industrial working class and the new working class exclusion from the social-political space, which is pursued by the ruling class of the neoliberal international. The empirical part of the article describes the political subjectivity of the working class in Russia and its position in the political space at the institutional and individual levels. Despite the underrepresentation of workers in politics, since 2010, we have witnessed a return of the working class to the public space. The representative survey conducted in three regions of the Ural Federal District and narrative interviews prove a weak interest of the new working class youth in politics, their tendency of non-participation in it, and a high level of national patriotic identity.

ID INDIVIDUALISM
AB The local government reforms of 1989 and 1993 were intended to establish a dual pattern of central-local relations in Estonia. The choice of this model was inspired and supported by the Nordic states. Although the legal framework for local government has remained untouched since 1993, the introduction of institutional mechanisms for strong local autonomy was not a success. The first part of this article seeks to identify the main factors that inhibited the launch of the new institutional model. These were a lack o f strategic influence on national policy-making, poor cooperation from local authorities, and the diminishing role of county-level governments and their subsequent liquidation. The second part of the article analyses the objectives and results of the local government amalgamation reform of 2017 as well as the theoretical and practical possibilities to re-establish central-local balances in Estonia. The analysis draws on institutional theory, which explains the effect of deep value patterns and concrete political choices on the institutionalization logic followed after the 1993 reform. It is concluded that the local elites retaining their old value patterns will downplay the effect of the 2017 reform.

AB Collective actions are the basis of social interaction. Collective action is defined as the system of organized individuals, who are included in groups, which have a certain degree of organization. The pecularity of collective activities is the fact that almost all people are involved in them, in one form or another. One of the first sociologists, who started the study of collective activities, was M. Weber. It was him who designated a collective action as a social one. While studying consumer behavior, economists also paid attention to collective activities of people (E. Ostrom). The result was the emergence of the social action concept in Sociology and the theory of collective action in Economics. Later, the number of researchers and studied problems in the context of a collective action expanded. Economists and sociologists were joined by psychologists, political scientists, anthropologists, biologists, and others. The theory of collective action allows us to explain a wide range of social life phenomena. This concept is closely related to the theory of social capital, which emerged at the intersection of economic and social sciences. Social capital is a factor that determines the intensity, effectiveness, and mass scale of collective actions. However, social capital itself is formed under the influence of collective actions. In foreign science, the problems of collective action and social capital are considered interrelated. In domestic social science, it is yet to be achieved. The theory of social capital has the umbrella effect, which allows searching for opportunities of theoretical and methodological integration of social capital components and forms of collective actions. The purpose of this article is to show, on the basis of the overview of the main research areas of social capital and collective actions in scientific literature, the most promising points of their contact for studying social reality in Russia. It includes the research of subjects of collective actions, transformation of their goals, the enrichment of the repertoire due to the emergence of new practices and the usage of virtual space. The important aspect is the environment for the implementation of collective actions, which forms their target orientation. The implication of concepts of social capital and collective action should allow us to identify aspects of mutual influence between them.

AB The article seeks to analyze a new stage in China-Japan relations in 2017-2019 and provide an assessment of the rapprochement in bilateral relations, explain its causes and characterize its depth. The paper begins by analyzing the key characteristics of the relationship before the current period. As a result of the escalation of the territorial dispute and a number of other factors, both China and Japan increasingly viewed each other as security threats and employed a balancing strategy. Strategic competition in Asia became a dominant trend. The following factors contributed to the rapprochement: China's desire to mend fences with Japan as a result of deteriorating China-US relations and exacerbating strategic competition in the Indo-Pacific, Japan's wish to hedge the risks of Donald Trump's inconsistent policy, the interest of both states in expanding economic cooperation, in particular that of China following its economic downturn, the aspirations of the two countries to stabilize their interaction in the East China Sea and avert military escalation, strong leadership and consolidation of power by both nations' leaders, a certain improvement in the attitude of China's population towards Japan. A conclusion is drawn that the positive dynamics between China and Japan should be regarded as a normalization of political dialogue and restoration of normal contacts. With no serious transformations of China's or Japan's foreign policy and security strategies, it is too early to conclude that a tangible rapprochement is actually taking place. Neither party changed its position on the territorial dispute and they remain strategic competitors for the regional order in Asia. The current stage should be more accurately characterized as conflict management, not conflict resolution. It is likely that a certain improvement of China-Japan relations is to continue in the forms beneficial to both states. However, it is unlikely to transform into tangible rapprochement, with strategic competition in the Indo-Pacific persisting.

AB The article analyzes the ideological content of the programmatic political poem "Commonwealth", written in the second half of the 1670s by the key Moscow court intellectual Simeon Polotsky. The concept of commonwealth in the Moscow political language is considered, and the source, which the poet used, is identified. There was the advice of the Seven Sages of Greece from the work of Plutarch, intended for democracy. Simeon Polotsky adapted the advice for the monarchy, which resulted in the proclamation of the law as an obligatory attribute of power of the monarch. As a result, the poet anticipated the legalism of the state of Peter I.

DE business dynasty; professional continuity; family business; owners'
   capital; heirs; status transmission
ID INTERGENERATIONAL TRANSMISSION; SELF-EMPLOYMENT; FAMILY FIRMS;
   PERFORMANCE
AB There is evidence of the reproduction of business dynasties in almost all countries with market economies. Many researchers argue that family succession in business is one of the factors in the stable growth of national economies. The socio-economic effects of business dynasties are ambivalent: they can be both constructive (the transfer of human capital, the reproduction of professional ethos) and destructive (the concentration of capital, familism and the restriction of competition). Both sides arc under scrutiny in the study at hand. In this article, we review the empirical research in Western countries and Russia. We conclude that the most important predictor of professional choice in business is parental entrepreneurial past, which involves the transmission of role patterns, access to established business networks, and the early formation of professional identity.
   Several models of the transmission of professional positions in business are distinguished: 1) continuity (a value-conscious acceptance of status quo and the desire to preserve it) - an active strategy; 2) maintaining status (subsequent generations take status for granted) - a passive strategy; 3) refusal or withdrawal from the continuation of the business dynasty. Successful succession in a family business involves the preliminary planning of the management transfer; the understanding of the basic principles and the rules of continuity by family members; attaining necessary education and practical experience. In contrast to Western traditions, in Russia inheriting both capital and a managerial position in business is not common. In Russia, the formation of business dynasties is hindered by macro level factors - the transitory institutional status of family entrepreneurship and an unfavorable socio-political and economic situation; and meso-level factors - the immaturity of the practices of business succession. In most cases, business families have not developed a systematic approach to capital transfer, no legislation regulating business inheritance exists, and children are often not informed about their parents' plans for and principles of succession. We conclude that in Russia the prospects for the formation of sustainable business dynasties are unfavorable.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE Crimean Khanate; Giray; Cherkess; heir; upbringing; manuscripts
AB Research objectives: This article considers some features of fosterage as a social institution that existed in the Crimean Khanate throughout most of its history. Above all, the ceremonial and practical aspects associated with the transfer of the children to the caregiver, the process of their education and return to their family are considered.
   Research materials: A section of the anonymous manuscript "History of Crimea" kept at the collection of the Institute of Oriental Manuscripts, RAS, under shelf mark B 747.
   Results and novelty of the research: Being widely practiced by many peoples of the Caucasus, fosterage had spread to the territory of the Crimean Khanate. Understanding of the origins and essence of this method of child rearing was greatly augmented by the works of famous Soviet ethnographer and historian, M.O. Kosven (1885-1967), which were dedicated to the institution of the family and social structure of the mountain peoples, especially his article "Fosterage". Meanwhile, the Crimean material is only briefly mentioned in that article. The text of one of the sections of the anonymous manuscript, "History of Crimea", shows that by the second half of the eighteenth century, fosterage had been practiced in Crimea only by representatives of the most privileged part of society, primarily by members of the ruling Giray dynasty. As might be assumed, the preservation of this institution was mainly dictated by political considerations, while its practical expediency for raising a child was no longer obvious. However, children of the Crimean khans continued to be sent to the Caucasian families for upbringing. The process of giving the children to the caregiver (atahk) and taking them back was subject to consistently followed protocols defining behavior of all participants of the process. Final institutionalization of fosterage was associated with the official recognition of caregivers among the highest court officials of the Crimean Khanate This article provides the full text of the aforementioned section of "History of Crimea" in Ottoman Turkish, transcribed and translated into Russian.

DT Article
DE COVID-19 pandemics; health; biopolitics; bioethics; non-linearity;
   globalization; glocalization; digitalization; reflexion; humanism
AB The article deals with the impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the health of the world's population, looked at through the context of the crisis in biopolitics. Biopolitics is based on liberal principles of formal rationalization, pragmatism, and mercantilism, which have - under the conditions of complex, non-linear, developing societies - proven to be dysfunctional; these reproduce ineffective approaches to medical instuance and to the treatment of patients whose situations do not correspond to the realities of interdependent development today. Specific contradictions of biopolitics, determined by its pragmatic values, are revealed; these now have become especially evident in their inability to effectively counteract the pandemic. In connection with this, possibilities of transitioning from biopolitics to another developmental trend are analyzed. It is shown that two opposing approaches to reforming existing biopolitical institutions have been formed: 1) the creation of a form of cosmopolitan biopolitics, assuming that its functionality should extend to both global and national situations, be based on the latest achievements of bioethics and social epidemiology, and take into account principles of substantive rationality and humanism, which are adequate to the complexities and non-linear progression of international development; 2) the movement towards improving nationally-oriented biopolitics, based on the "universal" principles of formal rationality and pragmatism, which, in the author's opinion, is a dead end, as it does not eliminate the confrontational division of the world into "Us" and "Others", nor does it address the risks posed by inequalities in the international division of labour. It is substantiated that the outcome of this confrontation depends on the objective factors of the nonlinear development of social and natural realities, which imply nonnative turbulence, natural discontinuities, and the possibility of bifineation points, but to a large extent also imply a subjective factor of the reflexivity of scientific and political actors. In conclusion, the crisis of the current state of biopolitics, which has deepened under the influence of COVID-19, and the ambiguous results in overcoming the challenges of the pandemic, suggest that in the post-coronavirus world, biopolitics will not be western-centric.

DT Article
DE Russian Empire; P. D. Svyatopolk-Mirsky; Vilna governor-general;
   northwestern region; Latin-Lithuanian font; russification
AB This article publishes a note by Prince P. D. Svyatopolk-Mirsky, governor-general of Vilna, Kovno, and Grodno between 1902 and 1904. The note focuses on a key issue of the management of the northwestern outskirts of the Russian Empire, the ban on book publication in Lithuanian printed in the Latin alphabet, which had been in use in the region since 1865. The ban was part of the policy of de-Polonisation and Russification of the northwestern region: implemented after the suppression of the Polish uprising of 1863-1864, it was aimed at protecting the local Lithuanian population from Polish influence. However, by the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, it became obvious that the measure had not justified itself, provoking mass discontent of the Lithuanian population, which had previously been completely loyal to the imperial authorities. In Russian political circles, a controversy was unfolding about the future of the Latin alphabet for publications in Lithuanian, some of which is reflected in the document published in the article. Svyatopolk-Mirsky, who had the reputation of a liberal bureaucrat, was an ardent supporter of lifting the ban, seeking to justify his position to Emperor Nicholas II and the top leaders of the empire, i. e. members of the Committee of Ministers and the State Council, on whom the decision was ultimately dependent. Published for the first time, the note is currently stored in the State Archive of the Russian Federation (CARP), fund 1729 (Svyatopolk-Mirsky). The content of the note is much wider than its original task, since it concerns not only the lifting of the ban, but also the need to revise the policies of the imperial authorities in the western periphery as a whole and abolish the a priori repressive and violent methods of its implementation. Also, the note examines the need for cooperation with the local community loyal to the authorities. The study of the source is of considerable interest in the context of analysis of the transformation of the imperial authorities' policy on the periphery of the empire as they faced the need to establish a dialogue with the local public and find new methods to implement their Russification policy, which was considered impossible to reject at the time. Another significant information layer in the source is the political views and features of modern management practices advocated by Svyatopolk-Mirsky, which he realised in the northwestern region and subsequently tried to transfer to the all-Russian level when serving as minister of internal affairs.

DT Article
DE science diplomacy; science policy; international S&T cooperation
AB In the conditions of growing tension in the international arena, the possibilities of science diplomacy once again attract the attention of scientists, politicians and managers of scientific foundations. Problems that go beyond national borders stimulate the use of methods of science diplomacy, which include contacts between individual scientists, groups of scientists, their international cooperation as well as cooperation between Academies of sciences. In addition to global challenges and threats, the extension of anti-Russian sanctions represents another obstacle to achieving the goals of Russia's foreign policy. In the context of the growing confrontation between Russia and the USA, the scientific sphere, among other things, is experiencing certain difficulties. It seems appropriate to examine how the collaboration of Soviet and American scientists was carried out during the period of the most acute disagreement, which replaced the era of detente. The article explores the period of the 1970-1980s of the XX century, when diplomatic relations between the USSR and the USA were most paralyzed. It explores how political differences influenced the sanctions imposed by the United States government on Soviet scientists. The decisions of the Soviet Union concerning the interaction of Soviet and American scientists are analyzed. It is concluded that "scientific sanctions" were applied for the first time during the presidency of Ronald Reagan, joint working groups and summit meetings were postponed and canceled, and agreements on cooperation in certain scientific fields between the two countries were partially terminated. However, despite the fact that during the most acute conflicts, the interaction between scientists at the local level took place and supported diplomatic relations between the USSR and the USA, the influence of members of the scientific community on the international situation and the improvement of diplomatic relations between the USSR and the USA as a whole should not be overestimated.

   Pankratova; Voprosy Istorii
AB This article offers contextual analysis of unpublished editorials from one of the issues of Voprosy Istorii academic journal, published in 1955. The issue focuses on the problems of studying the history of Ukraine and was written by N. I. Rubinstein, an outstanding Soviet historian and historiographer. The historian discusses the problems related to the history of Ukraine between the fifteenth and nineteenth centuries, as well as the formulation of the academic heritage of pre-revolutionary historians and the "school" of M. S. Grusheysky. The need to overcome a dependence on the conceptual heritage of "Ukrainian bourgeois-nationalist historiography", which, according to the historian, practically leveled the achievements of Ukrainian scholars, is a red-thread through the article. A kind of "familiar track effect" caused significant gaps in the study of Ukrainian 17th- and 18th-century history, as well as the dominance of negative assessments in understanding the process of integration of Ukraine into the Russian state. For the first time in Soviet historical science, the unpublished editorial voiced the need to overcome the monopoly on the study of Ukrainian history held exclusively by institutions of the Ukrainian SSR. In this regard, Rubinstein paid special attention to the Institute of History of the USSR Academy of Sciences, which, in his view, had to be transformed into a key organisational centre for-future research. All this suggests a potential divide in the academic study of Ukrainian history in the USSR and its conceptual rethinking, since Rubinstein was highlighting existing research issues. Via the case study of the unpublished Rubinstein editorial, the author demonstrates how the production of academic texts and regulation of research in the USSR were closely intertwined with administrative academic positions and personal connections of Moscow academics and Ukrainian historians (sometimes informally). Under these conditions, the directives of the party leadership at the centre and in the provinces fell into a certain dependence on the internal organsation of the academic community. Existing personal connections opened the way for a kind of academic lobbyism. This kind of lobbying paved the way for the entry of controversial ideas, interpretations, and conceptions that did not fit into the existing ideological framework in the difficult political conditions of the day.

AB Authors interpret the results achieved by analyzing the content of Russian political parties' manifestos that managed to enter the State Duma after 2011 and 2016 elections. Our conceptual framework is based on Immanuel Wallerstein's assumption that only three ideologies-liberalism, conservatism and socialism - were the key ones to 20th century experience and, hence, that any particular ideology might be reduced to that list. Firstly, we build a matrix of content analysis to analyze texts of officially published political parties' programs. As a result we could show that values at the core of any program at any stage were hybrid in nature and that there was increase in liberal rhetoric in 2016. Further we interpret the empirical results by applying both classical (M. Seliger) and modern (J. Schwartzmantel) models of ideology. By using Seliger's conception of ideology we demonstrate that our political parties choose not to defend the coherent value core of their programs in order to fulfill 'technical' task of generating sufficient electoral support. Schwartzmantel's idea that neo-liberalism as a "classical" state-oriented ideology is attacked by a plenty of non-classical, network-organized ideologies nowadays does not fit our reality, because there is no. pronounced opposition between neo-liberal and critical political discourses. Thus, we argue there is no. normative foundation either for conflict or concord among ideological projects and, moreover, that ideological struggle on the Russian political arena has left classical political domain. It requires social sciences to renew its methodological implements for analyzing ideology properly, while philosophy faces with self-description challenge.

AB The article, basing on publications by Chinese scholars, analyzes the approaches of the expert community to the development of relations between Russia and China. The announcement in June 2019 of the "new era" in relations between the two countries gave rise to expectations that cooperation would reach a qualitatively new level. Chinese diplomacy in the interpretation of the "new era" puts in the first place the strengthening of political trust and friendship between two leaders, followed by the tasks of developing economic cooperation, promoting public understanding, and jointly solving international problems. Chinese experts argue that now the relations between the two countries are basing on the coincidence of long-term strategic interests. At the same time, the "new era" has come against the backdrop of change in the balance of comprehensive national strength in favor of China. The emphasis on the limited prospects for China's economic cooperation with Russia and China's dependence on the US market leads to the conclusion that alliance relations are undesirable. Another point of view emphasizes that the closeness of the interests of China and Russia is due to the similarity of their strategic problems. Both countries are focused on the problems of economic development under conditions of increasing pressure from the West, so they need mutual support to provide each other well-protected "strategic rear". In this situation China should primarily take into account Russia's military and resource advantages. The recognition of the inevitability of long-term rivalry with the United States forces Chinese experts to recognize the need to reduce excessive dependence on America and strengthen ties with Russia. However, the expectation of changes in the dialogue between Russia and China due to the easing of US policy towards one of the parties in the foreseeable future seems unrealistic. The first year of the "new era" has been filled with unforeseen challenges. Among them are the coronavirus pandemic, a dangerous deterioration in Sino-US relations, a slowdown in global economic growth with the prospect of global depression. For joint actions to overcome the crisis the two countries need mutual political trust and support, which have become the quintessence of the "new era" of bilateral relations.

AB The question of the crisis of the USSR economy on the eve of "perestroika" is considered. Attention is paid to archival documents, which are introduced into active scientific circulation for the first time. The question of political and ideological support for the transformation of society and economy in the late USSR is raised. The results of a comparative analysis of documents of the official authorities and the expert community are presented. The research focuses on declassified archival materials deposited in the fund of the former chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers N. I. Ryzhkov (F. 653 - Nikolai Ivanovich Ryzhkov) of the Russian State Archive of Social and Political History (RGA SPI). The novelty of the study is seen in the fact that the analyzed documents allow shedding light on unknown crisis phenomena in the economic life of the USSR. In the course of the work, a circle of institutions was identified that monitored the socio-economic situation in the USSR in the first half of the 1980s. The relevance of the study is due to the problems of building a welfare state in modern Russia, improving the relationship between the center and regions in the Russian Federation. Analytical letters of representatives of the academic community and government agencies are studied. The theoretical basis of the work is connected with the ideas of M. A. Beznin and T. M. Dimoni about protobuzhuisia and state capitalism in the USSR, G. G. Popov about the latent conflict in the USSR between the power of experts and political functionaries.

AB The Kaliningrad region is the only Russian territory bordering Poland. Polish-Russian relations play an important role in the economic and social relations of Russia and the European Union in the Baltic, where the transnational Baltic region is being actively formed. In the 1990s and early 2000s, cross-border Russian-Polish ties were established across different fields. However the intensity of these ties has begun weakening, and after the 2014 Ukrainian crisis and imposition of sanctions on Russia, recession reached all aspects of Russian-Polish relations. It was not until 2017 that the trade external turnover between Poland and Russia, and Poland-Russia cross-border cooperation program projects, saw positive changes. Mutual tourist flow between the Kaliningrad region and its neighboring regions of Poland has started to enhance. This period is still relatively poorly covered in scientific literature, but the cross-border interactions taking place are actively studied by scholars. Kaliningrad and Gdansk host international conferences on international cooperation in the Baltic, which have become a tradition. Several academic journals specialize in the problems of the Baltics: the Baltic Region journal published by Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University, and Regiony nadmorskie journal published by the University of Gdansk. Despite the fact that cross-border ties have weakened, they continue to play a role in the development of the neighboring border regions of Russia and Poland. In this article, publications, statistical data, and the authors' research experience are analyzed to evaluate current cross-border interactions between the Kaliningrad region of Russia and the neighboring regions of Poland. The authors portray prospective directions that devlopment of these mutually beneficial interactions could take, which could be much more highly developed if political relations between the two countries improve.

AB The authors start from the premise that science is an empirical manifold and then examine different ways of dealing with it. The traditional essentialist approach would construct a single "essence," a unique and normative set of distinctive qualities that is to be found with minor variations in any branch of science. The usual elements in such a set are the concepts of fact, method, theory, experiment, verification and falsification, while any social, political and cultural processes or factors are discounted as external and collateral. This approach would provide a relatively straightforward account of what science is and reliably distinguish science from everything that is not science so that its claim to autonomy would be supported by a normative "strong" image of science. The history of science would then be reduced to a selection of illustrations of how that essence was formed and implemented. The most well-known versions of this essence and strong image are derived from a logical positivist philosophy of science and from the self-descriptions of many scientists, which are usually considered the authoritative explanation of science and often referred to when science is popularized. The authors point out some considerations that cast doubt on this privilege of self-description. Furthermore, scientificity requires that science itself become an object of specialized research.
   Studying the activities of scientists and scientific communities using the empirical methods of sociology, history and anthropology has exposed a divergence between the normative "strong" image and the actually observed variety of sciences, methodologies, ways to be scientists, etc. When those empirical disciplines are applied to science, they do not provide an alternative "strong" image of it, but instead construct a relativized and pluralistic "weak" one. The authors locate the crux of the dilemma of choosing between these images of science at the point where the desire to study science meets the urge to defend its autonomy. The article closes by briefly describing the current state of the history of science and outlining the possible advantages of choosing the "weak" image.

AB The development and deployment of new technologies have influenced the media environment by enabling quick and effective dissemination of false news via social networks. Several experimental studies have highlighted the role of thinking style, social influence, source credibility and other factors when it comes to fake news recognition. Our study makes several contributions to existing knowledge. Web introduce a measure of conspiracy thinking, a comparison between politics and business news recognition, and we investigate the effects of sensationalist headlines on users' abilities to differentiate between false and true news. 228 university students (203 completed the entire survey) from three departments (Humanities, Management, and Economics) took part in an online experiment. The results of a regression analysis demonstrate that double-checking of news online has a significant effect on individuals' overall ability of differentiating between true and false news. Thinking styles, prior experience, and such control variables as age and gender have no significant effect on the overall level of accuracy. We also discuss the effects of different factors responsible for the accuracy of fake news recognition in business and political news, as well as several limitations of the study.

AB The study specifies the concept of political ideology in terms of its matrix structure, in particular the "flickering concepts" of ideological attitudes, which are hard to identify by means of traditional sociological surveys. Considering the morphological approach to the analysis of ideological consciousness (suggested by Michael Freeden), the authors introduce the concept of cognitive ideological matrices, which allows us to describe the process of transition from protoideological to ideological concepts, especially at the level of individual consciousness. The authors studied the above-mentioned concepts of flickering ideological consciousness in the framework of scientific projects implemented by them during 2015-2019. The studies aimed to reveal the ideological attitudes of students of Rostov-on-Don. The methodology of these projects included quantitative and qualitative analysis: in the course of group interviews, based on the material of the discourse declared by the respondents, relevant "flickering" concepts of ideological attitudes were revealed and then operationalized in the questionnaire, and the results of the survey were later falsified in focus groups. Because of the study, it was possible to first identify the "zero level" of ideology, at which the minds of young respondents are potentially open to the influence of diverse and often mutually exclusive ideological orientations, and second, to pinpoint the changes that have occurred in the cognitive ideological matrices of Rostov-on-Don students over the past five years. These changes mean that the basic concepts of leftliberal ideology are strengthening, and the right-wing "flickering concepts" are shifting to the center-left concepts of social justice, equality, etc. In general, it is common for the interviewed students to display situational ideological attitudes and indifference toward larger ideological narratives. The results of the study can be used for comparative analysis and to forecast of the ideological attitudes of Russian students.

AB The class of managing bureaucracy as well as the class of intellectuals (broadly speaking, intelligentsia) seems to be partly cognate classes in modern and post-modern societies. However, in fact, as well as theoretically, these classes are widely different. The former provides all the institutional transactions in the fields of power and property, while the latter is connected with the processes of reproduction, development and renovation of knowledge. As for the present-day situation, it is peculiar because of not only social or political, but rather cognitive antagonism between the two classes. This complex of observations partly changes all the retrospective of social as well as human sciences, including historiography and political studies. Unique experience of the epoch of information contests the dichotomy "Power-Property", so habitual for Russian textbooks, imposing the triad "Power-Property-Thought" instead of it.

AB This study examines the impact of modernization on the levels of electoral and party contestation in Russia's 85 regions. By employing cluster and regression analysis, our study shows that modernization does have a positive impact on the degrees of political pluralism in Russia's regions. This applies not only to simple tools reflecting the levels of region-wide support for pluralism and a multiparty system, from the general population, but also the levels of support from the regional political elites. The study demonstrates that, the level of entrepreneurial activity is the main factor, which influences the levels of political pluralism.

DE Russo-Persian Relations in 17th century; Sahin Geray; Safi I; Mikhail
   Fyodorovich; archive files
AB The paper aims to provide insight into the content of the diplomatic documents from the "Persian" fund of the Russian State Archive of Ancient Acts, which reveals the role of the Crimean prince Sahin Geray in relations between Safavid Iran and the Russian Tsardom at the turn of the 1620s and 1630s. A detailed source examination is given to a group of nineteen texts dated by 1630. This set consists of letters in Turki and Farsi as well as their Russian translations and a preface by the administrators of Astrakhan. The addressees of correspondence were Astrakhan and Terek voivodes and the governor of the non-Russian population of the Terky Sholokh Cherkassky. The senders were Shah Safi I, Sahin Geray, beglerbeg of Shirvan Qazaq Khan and shamkhal of Tarki Ildar. The materials analyzed reflect the attempts of the aforementioned political emigrant, with the support of the Shahs Abbas the Great and then Sahin, to obtain diplomatic and military assistance from Moscow and the local Russian authorities of the Ciscaucasia in reconquering the Crimea. The authors reveal the details of the plan of Sahin Geray and the reasons for the Russian negative stance on any combinations involving the former Crimean qalga. The scholars conclude that Shah's supportof the political figure unacceptable for the Romanov monarchy became one of the significant factors holding back the development of Russian-Persian relations in the period under review. In the appendix, there is a Turki text of the firman by Safi I to voivodes, as well as its contemporary and recent translations into Russian.

TI US-Japan Trade Relations Amid the Globalization Crisis
SO MGIMO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Japan; USA; trade and investment; trade friction; trade agreements;
   trade and investment regime; multilateral institutions
AB Relations between Japan and the United States have shown significant changes in recent years. Although the main attention has been focused on the strategic and military aspects of these relations, mutual trade and investment, related policies and regulation attract more of the attention of the political elites of the two countries.
   The tensions between the two countries on this issue have a long history. However, they greatly intensified since President D. Trump moved into the White House. The 2019 trade negotiations and the conclusion of a limited trade agreement between the two countries did not result in a comprehensive settlement of conflicting approaches and stands on specific issues. The rising confrontation between the United States and China amid the spread of novel coronavirus epidemic in early 2020 alleviated tensions over Japan-US trade issues by temporarily removing them from the focus of attention of the US presidential administration. Nevertheless, soon they will again become hot issues in the agenda of bilateral relations in the larger context of the US trade policy.
   In Japan, fears are growing that long-term shifts in the worldview and attitudes of the American political elite pose new threats and create new difficulties for realizing Japan's interests. Of greatest concern is the erosion in the mind of the US elites of the established commitment to further liberalize global and regional international trade and investment through multilateral agreements and institutions.Trump administration's policy versus main trade partners has shifted towards working out and revising bilateral agreements designed to make American foreign trade more manageable and balanced, and it well may represent part of a long-term change and continue irrespective of the outcome of the US presidential election.
   The changes that have occurred in Japan-US relations regarding mutual economic ties confirm the general tendency of the international trade and investment system to become more fragmented, shifting from multilateral global and regional platforms to ad hoc agreements with clearly defined national goals and priorities.
   A possible change of political leadership in both countries will not change these processes, which reflect both the characteristic features of the world perception by national elites and the objective interests of influential business groups. At the same time, trade and investment policy is increasingly affected by non-economic factors, mostly"national security"considerations.This increases the role of diplomatic maneuvering and other levers and forms of influence in regulating trade and investment flows, and business environment for national and multinational companies.

ID SOVIET; WAR; COUNTERINSURGENCY; SOVEREIGNTY
AB Since the early 1980s, American scholarly and analytical literature has discussed the effectiveness of Soviet, and subsequently Russian, management of low-intensity conflicts. Though both the Soviet and Russian experience has been examined from many perspectives, including the military, economic, social and political, the American academic community does not tend to deem such an approach relevant and useful in terms of understanding US foreign policy. This disjoint is even harder to understand given the fact that the American military faced the same problems in Afghanistan and Iraq as the Soviet army experienced in Afghanistan (19791989), and Russian forces experienced during the First Chechen War (1994-1996). The greatest perplexity for American authors was the ability of Soviet and Russian leaders to recreate a power hierarchy on the ground while relying on their former adversaries - the Afghan Mujahideen and Chechen separatists. According to American intellectual discourse, reliance on a former enemy cannot be considered, by definition, during post-conflict state-building. Since the condition of the Russian conflict settlement model was pragmatism that is opposite to normative approach of the American policies in conflicts, this experience was not in demand in American foreign policy practice. The number of works by American scholars that include the comparison between the Soviet/Russian and the US campaigns is significantly smaller than the number of papers focusing on Soviet and Russian conduct, let alone their experience of nation-building. The aim of this study is to analyse American academic discourse about the Soviet/Russian experience of conducting low intensity conflicts. In the first part, the authors analyse the key mistakes of the Russian leadership during the campaigns, according to the estimates given by American researchers; the second part examines Russian strategy and its conflict settlement drawing comparison with the American experience. The authors conclude that US adaptation on the basis of Russian experiences in Afghanistan and Chechnya has proved impossible due to normative imperatives dominating American academic papers and policies. These imperatives bind the conflict resolution with the level of sophistication of a given country's institutions. Perhaps, the vice versa claim could have grounds, yet it exceeds the limits of this study.

A definition of public health is given; the scientific significance and relevance of the research are justified. The works of foreign and domestic authors, their approaches to the study of factors affecting public health are analysed. The analysis of the state of public health in 80s-90s of the last century during the political and economic crisis is made; the transition process from the so-called "budget-funded" financing model to the "insurance" one is described. Based on statistics and expert assessments, as well as international confrontations, conclusions are drawn about the multi-year underfunding of the healthcare sector, primarily from the state budget. A new stage of reforms is analysed: since 2014, the Russian government has begun the so-called "optimization" of healthcare. Its goals, results, feedbacks from doctors and patients are stated. They show the new reform is a negative process for health system. The blunders of health care reform have been sharply marked with the beginning of the pandemic of coronavirus infection. The facts of the self-sacrificing work of the doctors and nursing personnel during the pandemic period, the measures of the Government and the society to support medical workers were described.

The material presented is based on communications made by the authors and their subsequent discussion at the Bureau of the Department of Historical and Philological Sciences, Russian Academy of Sciences, on June 19, 2019. This discussion was connected with the joint events held by historians from the Russian Federation and Ukraine, which took place in 2018 and 2019 in Austria and were attended by the authors of the article. The social significance and relevance of the modern Russian-Ukrainian dialogue between historians and the mutual interest in it shared by scientists of the two countries are substantiated. The Russian-Ukrainian project on the publication of the Chronicle of Samiilo Velichko about events in Southwestern Russia in the 17th century is analyzed, which is undertaken by the Center for Study of the History of Ukraine at St. Petersburg State University and the Institute for the History of Ukraine of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (NASU).

AB The article is a review of the book by T.A. Alekseeva Theory of International Relations as Political Philosophy and Science (Moscow: Aspect Press; 2019). The last decades have been marked by large-scale transformations: the spatial-temporal characteristics of political processes change - political time accelerates, political space shrinks, sequence of the political development stages changes; boundaries between internal and external, center and periphery, material and immaterial blur. Despite the fact that these changes affect both domestic and international policies, the complexity of global political shifts significantly exceeds all internal conflicts. However, understanding of large-scale transformations lags behind the need for their meaningful interpretation. The need to understand the essence of large-scale processes is an inevitable and serious challenge for the management system. Thus, we need a theory of international research that would become a basis for both understanding the essence of changes and predicting the future development. Based on the achievements of foreign and Russian theory of international relations, T.A. Alekseeva presents a detailed conceptualization of this science. In the book, all its essential components are described in detail and combined into a logically consistent system, which brings the theory of international relations to a new level of the theoretical-methodological conceptualization. The author's comprehensive analysis allows to use its results for solving practical problems, in particular, for resolving international crisis situations, implementing large-scale projects of scientific diplomacy, and training a new generation of experts.

AB The February revolution, which ended autocracy and replaced Russia's political elites, also marked a striking break in the ideological sphere. The new Provisional Government and the intelligentsia could not ignore the past. Proposals surfaced immediately after the monarchy's overthrow to preserve the memory of the February Revolution. Created in Moscow on the initiative of V. P. Kranikhfel'd, The Society of the Museum of the Revolution aimed to collect artifacts and documents for the future Museum of the Revolution. The House-Museum in Memory of the Fighters for Freedom of Russia was conceived as a center for collecting materials on the history of the Russian revolutionary movement from the beginning of the nineteenth century until 1917: it was to consist of an archive, library, museum and lecture hall. The idea of organizing historicalrevolutionary museums to preserve the memory of the revolutionary movement was supported by the intelligentsia and scholars, and partly by the revolutionaries themselves. But funds were short, and the political situation in Russia was not conducive to founding museums. None of the societies formed the basis for future Soviet museums, but some of the materials collected by the societies were transferred to Soviet archives, libraries, and museums.

DE Cold War; United States; Soviet Union; universities; cultural diplomacy
AB Introduction. The United States' and Soviet Union's respective Americanization and Sovietization of other countries' universities during the Cold War were motivated by political fear. Methods. While realism often accentuates political fear as a driver of hard-lined policy, this paper embraces cooperative policy of states changing their initial political goals in order to appease target states. The comparative analysis and system approach are applied in the research. Analysis. Cases from Guatemala and Cuba make it evident that Washington and Moscow had to restrain and revise their projects at universities in order to maintain friendly political relations with the elite of their target governments. This paper explores the US policy at the University of San Carlos in Guatemala and the Soviet policy at the University of Havana in Cuba during the Cold War. The academic community's resistance to and sabotage of the transformations of the universities' national traditions and the fear that their strategic partners could interrupt the cooperation forced Washington and Moscow to curtail their Americanization and Sovietization. Local academics were able to abandon the superpowers' projects and reforms. The University of San Carlos rejected the establishment of social extension projects and the revisions of various courses suggested by American experts, and the University of Havana rejected the introduction of ideology-oriented disciplines of the Soviet model. Results. Political fear and the policy of appeasement led to neither the United States nor the USSR being able to achieve the Americanization or Sovietization of the target universities.

DE foreign policy; think tanks; national security strategy; new challenges

   integrated method
AB The article considers the system of foreign policy expertise as an independent subject of research. The authors note the positive aspects of competitive analysis of the external environment, which allows one to level out the asymmetry of political and economic cultures within a given country, as well as to smooth out the personal interests. This ensures a variability of approaches in foreign policy decision-making, which ultimately contributes to the promotion of balanced national interests. The North American approach differs in a number of parameters from the European foreign policy analysis, including goals, theoretical preferences, methodological trends, forms of theoretical ethnocentrism and various forms of social construction. The European scholars and experts in foreign policy analysis use the theory of international relations much more extensively than their North American counterparts.
   Based on the analysis, we propose to use a comprehensive integrated method, developed in the Russian Diplomatic Academy, using an interdisciplinary approach based on elements of political psychology, sociology of management, international law, structural, functional and institutional approaches, etc We also propose to use virtual cognitive centers and methodologies, which not only contain a specific sequence of stages of predicting the development of the international situation, but also provide an opportunity to choose methods of Foresight, taking into account the existing time, human resources and financial constraints, and the possibility of their adaptation to the applied tasks of analytical and prognostic activities of federal authorities in the field of foreign policy.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE Political reform; political change; parliamentary republic; mixed
   republic; institutionalization; Constitution; constitutional reform
AB The subject. The article is devoted to the analysis of the draft political and constitutional reform that was announced in the last Presidential Address to the Federal Assembly at January 15, 2020.
   The purpose of the article is to try to predict the positive and negative consequences of changing the legal status of the highest Russian authorities.
   The methodology of the study includes analysis and interpretation of Presidential Addresses to the Federal Assembly and Russian Constitution as well as dialectical approach and methods of political science.
   The main results and scope of their application. For a long time there was a clear request for changes in the government, and various expert platforms discussed issues related to changing the Constitution of the Russian Federation, which was adopted at a national referendum in December 1993.
   On January 15, 2020, Vladimir Putin addressed his 16th message to the Parliament. In accordance with the Constitution, the President of Russia annually addresses the Federal Assembly with a message on the situation in the country and on the main directions of domestic and foreign policy. The last address turned out to be a landmark and historical one, as it announced the main provisions of the upcoming large-scale political and constitutional reform in Russia. Heads of constituent entities, members of the State Duma and the Federation Council, Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Ministers, Federal Ministers, heads of Federal bodies, judges will no longer be able to have foreign citizenship or a foreign residence permit. He proposed even more stringent requirements for a candidate for the post of President: no foreign citizenship or residence permit even in the past, as well as permanent residence in Russia for at least 25 years. The position of the State Council is being strengthened and it is reflected in the Constitution of the Russian Federation as an institution of power in the country. The position of the Federal Assembly is strengthened by the fact that the Parliament is given the right to approve the candidacy of the Prime Minister, as well as all Deputy Prime Ministers and Federal Ministers. The status of local self-government and the role of governors in the regions is being raised.
   The main reason for the reform is the desire to reduce the powers of the President and transfer part of them to the Parliament, so that the next President is no longer endowed with virtually absolute power, and, in turn, can not initiate another reform without the approval of all branches of government.
   The author of the article identifies the reasons for the political reform and gives forecasts for the future after its implementation.
   Conclusions. The author links these changes to the upcoming transfer of presidential power after 2024. The reform does not mean the transition of the Russian Federation to a parliamentary republic, since the head of state retains the status of a key figure in the political system, and it is he who has concentrated key functions. Fixing a number of social obligations in the Constitution in terms of salaries and pensions will not have a significant impact on the socio-economic situation.

AB Introduction. The author aims to analyze the phenomenon of information interference with national political processes in the conditions of the contemporary information society and the evolution of the Internet as a space of political communications. The article shows that the digital information intervention is relevant and at the same time, a complex multidimensional phenomenon of contemporary politics. In many respects, the potential of the digital interference phenomenon is closely related to the essential features of functioning and the transformation of the contemporary Internet, which has been actively used when changing political regimes in many countries. The problem of information security and sovereignty of the present state on the Internet is becoming one of the most urgent in the conditions of the rapid development of information and communication technologies. Methods and materials. The issues identified in the article are investigated using the methods of comparative, structural-functional and normative analysis, included observation, as well as the case-study method. The method of scientific forecasting and scripting techniques has allowed to form a scenario for the effective settlement of international conflicts in the field of information security. The empirical base of the study is reports of foreign experts, official materials of state authorities of the Russian Federation and foreign countries, reports of Freedom House international organization, official speeches and statements by the heads of state on the issues outlined in the work. Analysis. Countering external information expansion is becoming one of the most critical tasks of effective political governance at the state level to preserve the sovereignty of the national political communication space, including domestic segments of the Internet. The initiatives of states to form the sovereign national segments of the Internet space are, on the one hand, an attempt to protect their political systems from external influence and invasion, to ensure their own political stability, and on the other hand, they create risks for the democratic potential of the Internet. The article substantiates the thesis that the phenomenon of interference in elections in actual practice often becomes not so much an objective process as an instrument of information warfare, mass political propaganda and discrediting political opponents, a manipulative tool that can be actively used not only by authoritarian regimes with a low level of democratic development. Results. The study shows that differences in understanding and defining the essence of the Internet by various countries give rise to a significant potential for political conflicts on a global scale. This circumstance leads the author to the conclusion that it is necessary to form international institutions capable of preventing and regulating information conflicts in the Internet space, as well as reducing global political risks (including risks associated with potential interference in the electoral process of sovereign states). The implementation m of this scenario will allow forming a collective responsibility in the functioning of the global Internet.

AB In the introduction part of the article, the author substantiates the topicality of the issue, defines the aim and formulates the problem of the research. The author sets to answer the question of what kind of creativity, in what subject, its bearer, and in what quantity is required by the modern community? Describing creativity, the author notes that the emphasis is shifted in favor of the problems of textuality, subjectivity, identity, discourse (circulation of meanings and texts in society). The creation and distribution of cultural goods that are identical to our needs most often involve the manipulation of symbols. Creativity as a specific characteristic of the subject of the educational process is closely related to his / her thinking, focused on the formation of content. Further, the author describes the ontological and epistemological foundations of such thinking. The ontology of the creative is highlighted both in the context of activity-through solving tasks and problems, and in the context of communication-through the creation and deviation from ideal entities through language and symbols. Going deeper into the structure of mental operations, the category of the creative is realized at all levels of the manifestation of the active ability of social individuals. At the same time, activities and communication, complementing each other, allow revealing the possibilities of the creative deeper. In the epistemological aspect, the creative as an active ability to solve problems is manifested first through the reflection of existing ones, and then through the design of new diverse properties, relations of the object. Here the nature of creativity is closely related to the specifics of the mechanisms of reflection. Further, on the example of the competence-based approach implemented in the higher education system in Russia, the author identifies the key characteristics of a modern subject, bearer of creativity. According to the author, the number of such subjects necessary for modern societycan partly be set by the current system of federal educational standards, by example of state educational institutions, and by competencies, the list of which is formed based on various areas of training. At the highest level of education today, the most relevant approaches are those related to the development of critical thinking and creative abilities of a person. One of the main directions in the work of higher education is the formation of professional foundations, which is associated with the inculcation of the ability to continuously learn and develop independently, both professionally and personally. In conclusion, the author summarizes the results and formulates a conclusion.

AB The article explores the development of relations between Cuba and the European countries during the postsoviet period. Having lost the access to the markets of the USSR and the European socialist countries, Cuba objectively was interested in finding new partners both for the replacement of the sources of industrial goods delivery and for exporting its own products. European countries seemed to be an adequate substitution of Russia (except petroleum products delivery). The article highlights how the economic interests of the EU to enter the capacious Cuban market contradicted principals of democracy and human rights. That was the reason for freezing periodically the progress in the economic links. The main obstacle for the bilateral economic cooperation was the EU Common Position, approved in 1996. The cancellation of the EU Common Position, together with developing of bilateral relations of individual countries enables the EU to become a strategic economic partner of Cuba. The analysis of the bilateral partnership provides better understanding how Cuban leaders act on the international scene.

TI Amnesia as a Type of Social Forgetfulness: Towards Refining the Concept
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE sociomnemonic deficits; social amnesia; forgetting; oblivion; amnesty
AB The aim of the article is to clarify the concept of social amnesia since its use is extremely contradictory in the discourse of social sciences and humanities. The relevance of this topic is explained by researchers' growing interest in the dialectics of memory and oblivion within the framework of memory studies as a separate research area. To achieve the aim, the author uses the methodology of conceptual analysis, primarily in the version proposed by the Russian political philosopher M. Ilyin. When discussing the differences between social amnesia and other sociomnemonic deficits, the author critically assesses the existing experience of typologizing social forgetfulness (F. Ankersmit, P. Connerton, et al.). The author emphasizes that, in current research papers, instead of the stated typologies of sociomnemonic deficits, their phenomenologies are often proposed. Based on the levels of forgetfulness indicated by St. Augustine in Confessions, the author identifies forgetting, oblivion, and amnesia as the three most common types of memory deficits that differ in the degree of loss of mnemonic ability. In favor of this typology, the author gives a number of linguistic (by comparing the semantics of the corresponding terms), philosophical (using conceptual distinctions proposed by P. Ricard, B. Vivian, et al.) and sociological (based on the concepts of structural and media amnesia as well as on the concept of amnesty as a kind of prescriptive forgetting) arguments. As a result, the author comes to the conclusion that it is necessary, first of all, to distinguish conceptually between the pragmatics of forgetting/remembering (when forgetting can be a form of remembering and vice versa) and the symbolism of oblivion, which implies the loss of memory of past events. An important distinction of oblivion from forgetting and amnesia is the taboo status of the forgotten. Neither amnesia nor the pragmatics of forgetting needs this, nor are they accompanied by the "ghosts of memory" that complement the symbolism of oblivion. On the other hand, social oblivion is not completely traceless since the memory of the very fact of forgetfulness and the ability to remember itself are preserved as well as the ability to operate with symbolic memory figures as analogs of categories of understanding. On the contrary, social amnesia involves the weakening of memory as a cognitive ability of social actors as a result of the destruction of above-mentioned figures, as well as the disappearance of basic knowledge of the past as a condition for identifying people with their communities. But, unlike the medical concept of amnesia, memory dysfunction in social amnesia does not lead to the loss of these social identities alone; at the same time, it is a necessary condition for the formation of new communities.

AB Traffic congestion has become one of the most important problems of the big cities all around the world. Traffic jams lead to huge economic, temporal, psychological, environmental and other costs for drivers of cars and other vehicles, transport enterprises, urban and national economies, as well as for pedestrians and city residents. Based on the analysis of the ranking of cities in the world's leading countries with the most significant traffic jams, which was developed by the Dutch company TomTom, the author puts forward the concept of the genesis of traffic jams. Traffic congestion in 52 cities of different countries is being examined. According to the author's concept, traffic jams in major cities are caused by a combination of six causes (or part of them): 1) the number of vehicles, 2) the number of inhabitants of urban agglomerations, 3) population density of urban agglomerations, 4) country's typical work culture, 5) architectural and urban planning type of the city, 6) the terrain in which the city is located. Different causes make different contributions to the genesis of traffic congestion, which allows us to speak about their hierarchy. In every major city's case, traffic jams are caused by a peculiar combination of their causes. Contrary to popular belief, the increase in the number of vehicles is not the most important cause of traffic jams. Special attention is dedicated to the analysis of traffic jams in big Russian cities. The Russian cities' traffic jams are caused by low standards of work culture, which lead to low standards of vehicle management and traffic management, by special features of the architectural and urban planning type of the cities, and by increase in the number of vehicles. Research on the causes of traffic jams allows developing ways to deal with them. The impact of some causes of traffic jams can be mitigated, but, in some cases, some of the causes are fundamentally irremediable.

   Security.
AB Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have transformed society and the economy and expanded opportunities for international cooperation. However, the unique capabilities of ICTs are used not only for the common good of humanity. Today, we are talking about an accelerated increase in threats in the information and cyberspace. Many states consider them as additional, but often these are the main spaces for military-political confrontation. Thus, the issues of inadmissibility of application of ICTs with military and political purposes for realization of hostile actions and acts of aggression are critically urgent acute. For this reason, the task of ensuring international information security has become part of the agenda for one of the six main committees of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) - the First Committee, where states investigate threats to peace, seek for ways to promote global security and disarmament. Discussion on international information security issues within this Committee plays a crucial role and requires a deep analysis by the scientific and expert community. The article presents the results of this analysis, starting from 1998, when the problem of international information security was first discussed at the UN on the initiative of Russia. The study identifies and investigates the possibilities and prospects of implementing the main goal in the process of ensuring international information security: namely, the creation of an international legal regime to ban the development, production and use of information and cyber weapons. In addition, this paper includes the results of a study on the UN work and prospects for its success in maintaining international information security in a new format: within the framework of the Open Ended Working Group (OEWG) organized in 2019 at the suggestion of Russia, and the UN Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) proposed by the United States. The output of both groups is going to have a significant impact on information security trends and policies on a global scale. Therefore, a timely scientific analysis of the issue, current challenges and threats, as well as the forecast of trends and prospects for enhancing international information security, presented in the article, are currently among the most relevant tasks.

DE skepticism; virtual reality; ontology; epistemology
AB In the new reality of the society of information, one of the topical themes in philosophy is the philosophy of artificial intelligence and virtual reality. The classic problems of ontology and epistemology do not lose their relevance, but transform in the framework of a new digital reality and require answers to their questions: what exists? what can the subject know? The problem of skepticism is one of these classic problems, affecting both the existence of the external objective world and the issues of cognition, knowledge and truth. In the philosophy of virtual reality and artificial intelligence, interest arose with renewed vigor in the simulation hypothesis, which was formulated by Rene Descartes, went through a series of transformations and appeared in a new form in the works of modern philosophers. This research is an attempt to formulate a new hypothesis of computer simulation and to consider in its context the classic problem of skepticism in terms of the three components of the simulated world: metaphysics, ontology and epistemology. The question of whether the subject's beliefs about the world are true in the simulation in in the focus of attention. The goal of formulating a new hypothesis is to describe the world of computer simulation in the most detail, including the creator of the simulation and the laws by which the simulated world operates. Such a detailed description of the simulated world can be viewed as a model of our world and allows thinking about fundamental laws from the perspective of an external observer, and not an included subject. But, in this research, the problem of skepticism is considered from the point of view of the subject in the simulation, in the framework of the coherence theory of truth. The positions of virtual realism, based on the interpretation of David Chalmers, and informational skepticism of Luciano Floridi are described too.

DT Article
DE taiga; forest; Siberia; conceptual history; sociocommunicative landscape
AB The aim of this article is to describe the history of the concept "taiga" the in Siberian discourse of the 19th century, to identify the key images associated with this concept and the main sociocultural, political, and economic factors affecting the transformation of the concept. The material is journalistic texts, reports of travelers and Siberian officials, forestry literature, and fiction of this period. The research methods are the tools of humanitarian geography, the history of concepts, and the sociology of nature. The study revealed that during the first half of the 19th century the word "taiga" was gradually becoming one of the central concepts for the description of the Siberian landscape. In the first quarter of the century, the use of the concept was caused by the interest of Russian society in the Siberian exoticism, the way of life, natural environment and language of the indigenous and old Siberian population. With the growth of public attention to the region, the development of gold mining, the growth of Russian journalism, and the emergence of Siberian literature, the concept became one of the most important for describing the space of Siberian colonization. In the structure of images of Siberia, "taiga" reflected and strengthened the mythologem of the region as a "cold", "harsh" and "boundless" country, on the one hand, and a country of undisclosed possibilities, a "storehouse of Russia" or a "golden Eldorado", on the other. Taiga is a "frontier", borderline concept, which is very frequently used in texts on the colonial development of the region. At the same time, during the first half of the century, the concept did not gain terminological clarity and was perceived as new and unfamiliar for the European part of Russia. "Taiga" meant not only the Siberian forest; it was a special space that endowed real geographic objects (Siberian mountains, forests, rivers, etc.) with certain meanings. Key of them were associated by contemporaries with "desolation", "savagery", but also with "primordially" and "greatness". Similarly, "taiga" denoted a borderline state between the natural and the social, making it possible to mark human relationships in the taiga with the characteristics of "wildness" and "unnaturalness", or, vice versa, of harmony with nature. In the ideological program of Siberian regionalists (G.N. Potanin, N.M. Yadrintsev), the taiga became a symbol of social unrest and problems in the region caused by the colonial policy of the Russian authorities.

AB The phenomenon of political liberalism and its genesis and evolution are explored. This phenomenon is studied using interrelated methodological principles at the crossroad of political philosophy, political theory, and international relations theory. The author analyzes the discourse of the "decline of Europe" and, more broadly, of the Western-centric world through the prism of changes in the forms of classical liberalism that have become part of political ideology. Special attention is paid to political neoliberalism, which from a once dynamic system of principles and values has turned into a dogma and is associated with the least popular aspects of the hyperphase of globalization. The elements of the weakening of Westcentrism are described, including the strategic decoupling of the United States and its European allies. The topic of the militarization of thinking and foreign policy of some countries is discussed. The author holds that the degradation of political neoliberalism clears the way to the search for a new balance between the ideological traditions of liberalism, conservatism, and collectivism.

AB The article provides a comparative analysis of the Chilean protests, which began in 2019 and the Yellow Vests actions, which had started a year earlier. In the 2019 global protest wave, the Chilean and French social crises have some unique characteristics, which include the sustainability of protest activity and the advancement of fundamental demands going beyond the current problems. The author analyzes both protests' interaction and their impact on each other. Several similarities of both protests revealed: lack of political leadership; the horizontal format of movements built upon the network principle; their remoteness from leading political parties, that is, the non-partisan nature of protests; all-national scale, etc. Chilean rallies were more radical in its nature involving a higher number of participants with a broader social base. The author explains difference in the protests' political orientation: the left agenda dominated in Chile, while in France the movement was meta-ideological (neither right nor left). The author concludes that in Chile the protest was more mature and managed to achieve more significant results such as the constitutional reform.

AB The concept of value is highly versatile. They distinguish economic, social, political, aesthetic, spiritual, and other values. The purpose of the study is to consider the value as a scientific category, to be exact, consider the value of services as a special form of commodities, using a logistics approach, to define the terms and concepts in the dictionary, based on the economic institutions' interaction problems.
   Methods. The methods of analysis and comparison were used in this research.
   Conclusions.
   1. Differences between services and products determine the difference in the values of these forms of commodities. If the comparison of product types is based on real objects, then the comparison of services is, in some ways, virtual. The prototype of the value of products is more precise than the prototype value of the service.
   2. Value is appropriate to consider in the logistical aspect. In one of the hypostases, logistics acts as a service that implements the delivery of a commodity at the appointed time and place, which determines the value of the product to the consumer.
   3. The category "value" is associated with the category "price". But the price is an economically reasonable concept, and value combines objective and subjective elements. The price is public, and the value is individual or collective. External factors influence the formation of prices, while internal factors influence values to a greater extent.
   Prospects for further research. The article raises the question of the commodity's value to be purchased. It is advisable to consider the value in the context of interaction of institutions in the aspect of already -purchased commodities, which is compared with costs (time costs, one-time and current expenses), and also reflects the influence of objective factors and subjective opinions, for example, the new phenomenon of ICO.

AB Under the conditions of China's steadily growing role in world politics, the task of moving from assimilation and criticism of Western theoretical discourse to creation and development of national political science schools is becoming more and more urgent. The article gives a brief review of the Chinese political science history, outlines the main achievements and tasks of the current stage in the process of formation of political science with Chinese characteristics. The article disputes the thesis of the universal nature of Western political science, critically evaluates some Western political theories: democracy, constitutional government, civil society; an attempt is made to show their shortcomings and limitations of their application. The main focus of the article is on clarifying the Chinese theory of democracy, which enriches and develops Marxist democratic theory, based on a generalization of the history of China's democratic practice and an analysis of modern democratic politics led by the CCP. Another important area of interest of the Chinese political science school - the empirical studies of the political development of China - is also covered. The features of the Chinese parliamentary system, the system of political parties where the Communist Party plays the leading role, are described. An attempt is made to depict the relationship between the party leadership and the legislative branch in China. It justhes the need for the formation of government bodies from top to bottom on the basis of the Chinese consultative democracy principles, which to a certain extent oppose the "elective democracy" concept. Particular attention is paid to rural self-government bodies and difficulties in their formation, which have recently caused a hightened interest among Chinese researchers. The final part of the article outlines the most important tasks of Chinese political science for the near future.

TI THE U.S. - ISRAEL "SPECIAL RELATIONS": STRUCTURAL FOUNDATIONS AND TRUMP

DT Article
DE special relationship; USA; Israel; U.S. - Israel relations; foreign
   policy; Trump; Obama; Netanyahu; Middle East
AB The article examines the evolution of U.S. - Israel special relations in order to estimate the scale and longevity of Trump's policies effects towards Israel. By the start of the 2016 presidential electoral campaign, the state of bilateral relations had been frequently considered as damaged due to the decisions of the Obama administration to engage in negotiations with Iran and to abstain from vetoing the U.N. Security Council Resolution 2334. Contrary to that, Donald Trump was consistent in his absolutely anticritical and pro-Israel positions, realizing all his initial promises regarding the Jewish state. By the end of his first term, he significantly shifted the well-established framework of the American traditional policies towards Israel. This raises a question on whether such dynamics might become a pattern in U.S. - Israel relations, and what might be the prospects for these relations being seriously determined by the U.S. internal polarization. The study covers the dynamics in key areas that define the strategic structure of the U.S. - Israel partnership. The first part of the article addresses the trends in bilateral and international relations that originated in the late 19th century and eventually led to the establishment of allied relations. Those trends are: a gradual rise of mutual importance in foreign policy strategies of both states; institutionalization and strengthening of pro-Israeli political forces in the United States. Both trends impeded a crisis in bilateral relations after the end of the Cold War. The second part concludes that since 1967, both states refer to each other as key strategic allies with common values, and that the range of their cooperation was framed in a specific spectrum of topics, most of which were Israeli-centered. The third part analyses the activity of the main pro-Israeli lobby groups in their support or opposition to the U.S. electoral campaigns and Congress legislature, and the views of the American public towards Israel. The authors find that the U.S. polarizations trends also affected the views in the lobby, but it never reflected upon the final legislature process, which is mostly pro-Israel. The fourth part addresses the asymmetrical nature of bilateral cooperation in trade, security and in the bodies of the United Nations. Finally, the fifth part of the article covers the policies of Obama and Trump administrations and the attitudes towards them of the main political forces in Israel and the United States. Those attitudes reflect the formation of two camps in both countries with polar incompatible views on the key issues of bilateral relations. The authors conclude that due to the structural asymmetry of the U.S. - Israel relations, their dynamics will be mostly defined by the changes in the grand strategy and the polarization of the United States. Nevertheless, the complexity and a large number of influential groups interested in maintaining the exceptional level of cooperation will prevent from undermining the structural foundations of the U.S. - Israel special relations in the foreseeable future.

DE Aristotle; Topics; Ancient logic; fuzzy logic; argumentation theory
AB In this article, the author interprets Aristotle's Topics as a kind of informal fuzzy logic. Since the time of Aristotle, there has been a distinction between real and apparent proofs. Galen of Pergamum noticed that some concepts have vague boundaries and fuzzy edges, and, consequently, as it was added by G. Lakoff, natural language sentences will very often be neither true nor false nor nonsensical, but rather true to a certain extent and false to a certain extent. As it is known, Topics contains the theory of dialectical discourse, which, as the author shows, is aimed at the study and use of fuzzy thinking and vague patterns of argumentation. After Topics, there has been a rich tradition of investigating reasoning and argumentation with approximate certainty. It is noteworthy that Alexander of Aphrodisias, the "chief imperial logician" and head of the Peripatetic school, treats Topics as a textbook for practising philosophers. This indicates that Topics was devised as a special philosophical tool designed both for communicative- dialectical counteraction between agents and for capturing vague content of endoxa The key concepts of Topics are endoxa AND protasis dialektiki. The latter can be represented as a fuzzy 6-valued truth-likelihood matrix (f), according to which the dialectical proposition accords with the opinion held by everyone (p(1)), or by the majority (p(2)), or by the wise (p(3)), or all of the wise (p(4)), or the majority (p(5)), or the most famous of them (p(6)), and which is not paradoxical. The likely or plausible here is endoxa. The epistemological guarantors of the likely truth (f) of some propositions (q) are elements of the disjunctive set E: {p(1) boolean OR p(2) boolean OR p(3) boolean OR p(4) boolean OR p(5) boolean OR p(6)}. All the disjuncts can be interpreted as possible worlds. Obviously, (f) = fuzzy 1 if the disjunction E is true. Also, what is true for the wise (p(3)), or for the most famous (p(6)), may be false for the majority (p(2)). Thus, (f) is vague. Topics can be considered as a kind of informal fuzzy logic. When Lotfi A. Zadeh raised the question of approximate reasoning, he, in many ways, pursued Aristotle's idea of construing a crisp discourse to deal with the fuzzy one. In fact, any concept of Topics within the framework of endoxa can be denoted as a fuzzy set because for each individual (X) there is a fuzzy membership function mu X(y) from 0 to 1. Fuzzy membership function and fuzzy set jointly determine the lack of semantic precision described by Galen as the uncertainty of concepts.

TI IT EDUCATION AS A FACTOR TO INFLUENCE GENDER IMBALANCES IN COMPUTING:
   COMPARING RUSSIAN AND AMERICAN EXPERIENCE
SO OBRAZOVANIE I NAUKA-EDUCATION AND SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE IT education; women in computing; gender imbalances
AB Introduction. The problem of the relatively small number of women professionally employed in computing (computer science and information technology) is relevant throughout the world. Despite the fact that IT professionals are widely in demand, women in many countries, including the USA and Russia, make up no more than a quarter of their total number, which requires explanation. One of the major reasons for this phenomenon, according to the authors, lies in the education system.
   The aim of this article was to analyse the factors affecting gender imbalance in IT professions, by comparing two countries in which information technology has historically played an important role, and which are very different from each other in many ways - economic, political, educational system and others.
   Research methodology. The present research is based on the comparison of data on IT education in schools and universities, and the degree of involvement of girls and women in computing in the USA and Russia.
   Results. Both in the USA and in Russia, gender imbalances in IT professions are formed largely in the field of education. Cultural stereotypes about computing as a male-dominated profession are produced by the media. Such stereotypes can discourage some girls and young women from studying computer science and also result in imbalance formation. The education system needs to increase the confidence of girls and young women in the possibilities of realising their abilities in the field of computer science and information technologies. Educational institutions should help to eliminate the negative attitude towards girls' choice of IT professions.
   Scientific novelty. For the first time, general factors in the field of education were identified that affect gender imbalances among IT professionals in Russia and the USA - the countries with significantly different traditions and educational systems.
   Practical significance of the present work is to justify the conditions for improving school and university education to solve the problem of gender inequality in IT industry.

DT Article
DE science communication; theory and practice; scientific expertise; public
   policy; governability; power
AB The article clarifies the thesis about the autonomy of science in the political sphere. This clarification is topical since the thesis is far from unambiguous: it itself can be heard in the context of defending a certain political position. The clarification of this thesis implies, firstly, a distinction between politics as a struggle for power and policy as a practice of decision-making in important areas of public life and, secondly, a distinction between professional scientific research activity and activities of scientists as experts. The author shows that various elements of the scientific theoretical activity, no matter how far they are from the practical sphere, contain the possibility of engaging in politics as a struggle for power. The author also demonstrates that activity of scientists as experts, despite its obviously practical nature, allows the possibility of independence from a certain political position and participation in constructive political communication that assumes a rational justification of policy. The author correlates this participation with the concept of universal criticism (Edmund Husserl) and the mediated role of scientific experts as honest brokers (Roger Pielke). This research is conducted at the intersection of philosophy of science and social epistemology, as well as political research. The problem of sociopolitical dependency of professional scientific activity is revealed in the context of public science communication. The analysis of conditions of engaging scientists as scientific experts in making socially significant decisions, while avoiding the subjectivity of any party position and the struggle for power distribution, intersects with the study of the conditions of civic participation and governability involving cooperation and activity of all actors of political processes. This analysis allows determining the conditions for scientific experts to support coordinating institutional governance designs. Moreover, this research can serve to clarify and achieve the autonomy of science in political sphere.

DT Article
DE American Arabs; communities; immigration; USA; Middle East; Barack
   Obama; Donald Trump; polls; discrimination
AB Pro-Arab lobbyism is structurally divided into two levels: formal (lobbyism of individual Arab states, usually coordinated by their embassies in Washington, which hire local PR companies) and informal (political activity of communities of American citizens of Arab origin). Despite the relationship between them, the directional vector of these two levels of lobbyism does not always coincide, and not in everything. Formal lobbying aims to improve the quality of bilateral relations between an individual Arab state and the United States, including to provide American assistance in meeting challenges of this state in the Middle East. The attempts of the Arab embassies to rely in this work on the local support base among their former compatriots are not always successful, since the range of interests of the latter is mainly confined to solving their own domestic problems, which are usually associated with the need for adaptation in American society. Moreover, the participation of both types of pro-Arab lobby in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign revealed the divergence of their interests: the efforts of state lobbyists (Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Egypt) were aimed at mobilizing support for Republican D. Trump while the majority in American-Arab communities (AAC) chose to vote for H. Clinton. This situation is generally repeated during the 2020 campaign. Moreover, this time the differences have deepened even more: the AAC are making efforts to prevent D. Trump's second term, and for doing this they are ready to vote for J. Biden; the Arab monarchies in the Persian Gulf, on the contrary, are doing a lot for the victory of the current head of the White House. In general, pro-Arab lobbyism ("Arab factor"), like pro-Israel one as well, objectively involve Washington in the military-political vicissitudes of the Middle Eastern region, trying to keep this agenda among priorities of the U.S. foreign policy.

DE moral responsibility; historical responsibility; moral division of
   labor; subject of responsibility; object of responsibility; reactive
   attitudes; principle of dignity; respect as motive; reactive attitudes
AB The article successively discusses three objectives: conditions of the origin and direction of transformation of the idea of responsibility; analysis of the results achieved along the way; and their application to research the idea of historical responsibility. Based on the analysis of the works of McKeon, Jonas, Vogelmann, and Williams, it is shown that the origin and direction of changes in the idea of responsibility are linked with the specificity of modern civilization: democratization of public life; future-oriented attitudes, growth of technological potential; and variety of systems of normative demands. It is noted that this state of affairs requires the formation of a subject capable of reflectivity, judgment, imagination, and initiative; involves the development of the ability to coordinate different normative demands in time and space, and is aimed at universalizing these requirements and skills. As a result, responsibility begins to be interpreted not so much as responsibility for the harm caused (outcome responsibility), but as responsibility for the future; take not only a legal but also a moral character; turn not only into a list of requirements, but also into value (virtue responsibility); be interpreted not only as a set of reproaches and accusations, but also as the ability to adequately respond to the growing diversity and inconsistency of normative attitudes. It is shown that in modern literature, starting with Hart's works, responsibility is interpreted not as a single, unitary, and generic concept, but as a set of meanings. In general, we can speak at least about the following meanings of this concept: capacity responsibility; virtue responsibility; causal responsibility; outcome responsibility; forward-looking responsibility or role responsibility. The perspective of the contextual approach to the interpretation of the content of responsibility is shown. It presupposes the rejection of its naturalistic interpretations and the connection with the peculiarities of the dominant norms and values. Smiley's ideas were taken as methodological guidelines that concretize the contextualist approach. Smiley insists on the dependence of our interpretations of responsibility on both our configuration of the individual's social role and our own sense of whether or not those being harmed are part of the individual's community. To identify the specifics of moral responsibility, Kant's ideas about the role of dignity as a determining moral principle and respect as a priority moral motive were used. The preference of the Kantian approach in comparison with the Strawsonian idea of reactive attitudes is shown. The above approaches were applied to the interpretation of historical responsibility. It is proposed to interpret historical responsibility as responsibility for preserving knowledge (memory) of the past. Within the framework of this approach, it is proposed to single out three roles in the distribution of areas of responsibility: producers of historical knowledge, translators, and consumers (readers). It is shown that the formation of knowledge (memory) about the past involves not only a revision of the content of stories (the formation of shared history and dialogical memory), but also the rejection of ethnocentrism or methodological nationalism as the principles of interpreting the past.
   It is emphasized that the use of Kantian interpretations of dignity and respect determines the criterion for a moral attitude to the past and allows one to create an appropriate framework for the interpretation of certain segments of the past.

DE transparency; information-oriented society; state authorities; local
   governments; information openness; Crimea; federal city of Sevastopol
AB The problems of transparency as an economic, social, political and legal phenomenon attract the attention of scientists in various fields of liberal arts - economics, sociology, political science, and jurisprudence. In this article, the authors are primarily interested in legal and political aspects of this phenomenon, since the current Constitution of the country pays considerable attention to the issues of democratic organization of power and the institutions of participation of citizens in the management of state affairs.
   Describing the real state of transparency in the public authorities of the Republic of Crimea, both static (institutional, organizational) and dynamic (functional, procedural) aspects of this phenomenon are taken into account.
   The current Constitution of the Russian Federation 1993 does not have the concept of "transparency". The analysis of Russian legislation shows that the principle of transparency, even without being enshrined at the highest constitutional level, has been adequately reflected in federal laws and other regulations. Legislatively enshrined transparency, openness, publicity, accessibility of information together create a regime of transparency of the activities of the three branches of state and local government, ensure the access of citizens to information and determine the forms of interaction and cooperation of citizens and power institutions in this area.
   The authors emphasize that the principle of transparency plays an important role in the system of principles of the organization and functioning of the public authorities of the modern democratic state. Its further legislative development will promote the confidence of citizens in public authorities, establish the dialogue between the state and civil society, and strengthen anti-corruption measures.
   Legal regulation of openness, publicity, accessibility of information about the activities of public authorities is carried out within the framework of several legislative acts ("On the media," "On ensuring access to information on the activities of state and local governments" and others). It seems appropriate not only to generalize these norms but also to include other ones developing this institution within the framework of a single federal law on the transparency of state authorities in the Russian Federation.
   The authors believe that we need the measures to improve the effectiveness of the institution of transparency, including, for example, the consolidation of criteria (indicators) of transparency of public authorities
   The study of the principle of transparency of public authorities in the Republic of Crimea shows that the new subjects of the Federation have created legal and organizational conditions for the implementation of the principle of transparency. Though, there are some problems including the lack of developed and accessible telecommunication infrastructure, the orientation of the Crimean providers to Ukraine, formalism in the consideration of citizens' appeals, not always prompt and objective information about the activities of the authorities of the new subjects of the Russian Federation, the need to ensure information security, the development of cooperation between Crimean and foreign organizations in the field of information and communication technologies.

TI EU SINGLE FINANCIAL MARKET: ILLUSION OR REALITY?

   Markets Union; Banking Union
AB The building of the Single financial market (SFM) has always been the integral part of the Common European market and now is closely connected with the development of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) and strengthening the role of Euro as a common European as well as international currency. The article reviews the formation of the SFM from its very beginning (liberalization of the capital flows inside the Community and introducing the single passport for financial services in 1980-s) up to the Banking Union (BU) and Capital markets Union (CMU) nowadays. The authors underline that the process is time-consuming and not lineal. That is why the targets and implementation timetable of the action plans very often are revised according to the new environment and new challenges. The main focus of the research is the building of the SMU in close relation with BU. Analysis shows that though banks are and will remain the essential element of the EU financial system, the domination of the bank-based lending over market-based now complicates Europe's balancing its financial risks, more effective funding of digital economy and small and medium-sized enterprises, lead on sustainable development. That was the main reason for the adoption of the CMU action plan (2015-2019), but as it is shown in the article, the targets were achieved only in a small part. The analysis of the statistical data, done by the authors, proves that in spite of measures, adopted by European institutions, the national capital markets remain fragmented, less liquid and diversified than their competitors worldwide. This conclusion is confirmed by Key Performance Indicators (KPI) analysis for CMU, done annually by the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME). According to AFME data for 2018 the best result is achieved for Sustainable Finance Indicator and one of the poorest - for Fintech Indicator. These shortcomings are aggravated by Brexit. So the new start for CMU was launched, partly inspired by European Commission, in 2019-2020 by the European experts reports, which are reviewed in the article. The authors came to the conclusion, that theoretically new proposals contain a lot of useful ideas, including the focus on retail clients and SMEs, long term savings and new investment opportunities for real economy, FinTech, etc. But the practical implementation is quite another thing. Building the European Single market for capital in the near future seems to be doubtful because of numerous barriers originating from national law, different levels of economic and financial development, financial culture of savers and investors and least but not last the absence of the real political support of the national authorities. To transform their aspiration to reality Europe needs the determined actions not only from the European institutions, but from Member States national governments and financial regulators, financial industry itself, savers and investors, including households.

DE sticky economy; tribalization; polarization; inequality; immigration;
   universal basic income
AB The book Good Economics for Hard Times: Better Answers to Our Biggest Problems is the answer of the 2019 Nobel laureates in Economics Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo to the fundamental challenges of modernity. Its pages are devoted to the questions: why do economists and other social researchers offer ineffective responses to global challenges? What are the dangers of stereotypical thinking and outdated economic schemes and theories? Why can't we rely only on the scientist's intuition? What is the power of painstaking social research based on experimental methods and careful processing of facts? Why are there no universal recipes for economic growth? Why is each national variant of socioeconomic development unique? What role do traditions and values play in these options? Why does the growth of income inequality turn into a polarization of ideologies and political positions, leading to an increase in intolerance, racism, tribalization, and so on? How do ideological approaches and populism become a distorting lens of reality? Why do the anger and despair associated with personal injuries and failures turn into anti-immigrant rhetoric and wall-building? Why does the idea of a universal basic income not find empirical support and what can replace it?
   All readers and researchers who are interested in these issues will be introduced to a large-scale, thorough study based on the generalization and analysis of a wide range of social surveys and other studies with the widest regional coverage. The authors strive to dispense with the prevailing stereotypes in science, relying only on facts and their experimental confirmation. The book is written in a very lucid literary style, with a certain amount of humor.

AB The paper presents a comparative analysis of burial assemblages of 'barbarian' elites located on the territory of the Crimea between Chersonesos Taurica and the Bosporan kingdom dating from the 3rd century BC to the mid-3rd century AD. The main goal of the research is to define indications of self-identities of the Crimean non-urban societies represented by their elites and to outline their networking inside and outside the peninsula as well as their changes during four chronological periods. The research is based on the precondition that networking in the political sphere is closely connected to the exchange of symbols of power and status. In material culture, such symbols might be represented by the so-called 'prestige objects'. Changes in the assortment of these items observed over a long time-span are helping to visualize the development of internal and external relationships of social elites.

AB At present time, there are three main international integration projects actually operating in the Eurasian space. the European Union (EU), the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) and the Chinese "Belt & Road Initiative" (BRI) project. All three differ in the time of their beginning, in economic and political possibilities, in methods of implementation and in its goals. All projects, one way or another, interact with each other in Eurasia with different intensity, potentially open up wide opportunities for them, but also create new problems. For Russia relations with China is one of the most important factors of its foreign policy and the Chinese project is a substantial part of it. The article examines the history of the Chinese project, the reasons for its occurrence, and the problems arising in bilateral and global relations in the context of Russia's participation in it.

AB The propensity of the public to protest is a dynamic process, the direction of which determines the level of political stability. Aggregate indicators of the readiness to act collectively against declining standards of life can be used as a thermostat that indicates the level of economic grievances in society. What explains these dynamics? Do incremental changes in objective economic indicators such as inflation or unemployment matter the most, or is it the subjective evaluation of the situation in the country that drives protest attitudes? In this paper, I argue that two mechanisms link inflation and unemployment to the readiness to join economic protests: first, high levels of both indicators increase the gap between actual and desired consumption levels; second, high levels of inflation and unemployment signal the lack of governmental competence. I also argue that the subjective evaluation of the direction of the country has an independent effect on the aggregate level of readiness to join the collective actions with economic demands. Statistical analysis based on the autoregressive model with distributed lag (ADL) confirms the hypothesis of the consumer price index and unemployment's lagged impact on the readiness to protest, while public optimism exhibits both short- and long-term effects on the protest mood. The analysis also reveals the high level of persistence in the dynamics of protest attitudes. The study contributes to the discussion on the determinants of the mobilization and significance of objective and subjective economic grievances.

AB The article aims to show the transformation of the science and the academic discipline "History of Russian Law" over the period from 1917 to the 1940s, to establish the degree of continuity and innovations that manifested in the transformation. The study is based on research works on the history of state and law, published historical sources, archival materials. Narrative, comparative legal, and institutional methods were used. Two institutional forms of legal science development were identified: universities and departments of the Academy of Sciences. In the 19th century, an independent area of scientific knowledge was established; its object was historical forms of law. Educational courses on the history of Russian law were based on the study of legislative acts and other sources of law. According to the University Charter of 1863, departments of the history of Russian law were created, scientific research was actively conducted, and works on the history of law were published. After the 1917 revolution, the political and ideological trends in legal science and education changed dramatically. Universities and academic structures as institutional forms survived, but underwent major changes. Law faculties were abolished at universities, specialized departments were closed. The history of Russian law or a comparable discipline in content was not taught To prepare new academic personnel and conduct research in social sciences and the humanities, including legal science, the Socialist, subsequently Communist Academy and the Institute of Red Professors were opened. These institutions did not create separate units specializing in the study of the history of state and law. The circle of researchers studying such problems decreased sharply. In the 1930s, the Soviet model of the organization of science and higher education, which included many elements that had developed in the Russian Empire, was approved. Interest in historical sciences was restored. Curricula for training lawyers included a discipline that was first called "History of the State and Law of the Peoples of the USSR", and later "History of State and Law of the USSR". The leading role in the development of its content, object, and method belonged to S.V. Yushkov. The continuity with the history of Russian law was preserved. The most significant differences were the change in the chronological and territorial framework, the etatization of the object, and the use of the Marxist methodology. New approaches were reflected in the textbook History of State and Law of the USSR. The first part of the textbook, prepared by S.V. Yushkov, was published in 1940. It covered only the pre-revolutionary period. The second part described the history of the Soviet state and law. It was edited by A.I. Denisov and published in 1948. Thus, by the end of the 1940s, the new branch of scientific knowledge and academic discipline was established.

DT Article
DE criminal policy; criminal responsibility; criminal proceedings; crime;

AB In the article, the authors consider the problems of the formation and implementation of criminal policy in relation to crimes committed in the field of entrepreneurial activity in the context of the development of criminal and criminal procedural law and law enforcement practice.
   In the Russian Federation, special attention is paid to building trust between government and business; stability and predictability of legal regulation of economic relations; the formation of a law enforcement system that effectively protects economic rights and freedom of entrepreneurship. At the same time, the current norms on responsibility for crimes of an economic orientation in conjunction with procedural forms of criminal proceedings, as well as their actual implementation, cause justified concern in the science of law and law enforcement practice due to their imperfection.
   Ensuring the protection of economic relations should be expressed not only in combating economic crime, but also in the development of effective criminal law and criminal procedural mechanisms for protecting the legitimate interests of entrepreneurs who may be involved in the sphere of criminal proceedings.
   The leading components of Russian criminal policy in the field of economic security are such forms of legislative transformation as criminalization and decriminalization. The ongoing socio-political and economic transformations necessitate the decriminalization of certain acts (for example, in relation to pseudo-business; deliberately false advertising, consumer fraud, etc.) or require the criminalization of certain acts in the economic sphere (in particular, in relation to the falsification of a single state register of legal entities, illegal retail sale of alcoholic and alcohol-containing food products, etc.)
   The humanization of legislation is substantiated by modern concepts of substantive and procedural guarantees for ensuring the rights of entrepreneurs, aimed at mitigating measures of criminal repression, the need to maintain a balance of private and public interests that need appropriate legal protection.
   Modern criminal policy is inevitably associated with the further modernization of criminal proceedings, the democratization of its principles and means of law enforcement. At the same time, the main emphasis is placed on the creation of a special, favorable procedural regime in the conduct of preliminary investigation and court proceedings. First of all, this concerns changes in the procedure for applying preventive measures. In addition, in cases of crimes in the field of entrepreneurial and other economic activity, the criminal procedure legislation has undergone changes, fixing the features: the procedure for considering a report of a crime; initiation of a criminal case against entrepreneurs; the performance of procedural actions with electronic media, other items and documents seized in the course of criminal proceedings; release from criminal liability and termination of criminal prosecution, etc.
   It is concluded that, within the framework of the state's criminal policy, one should expect changes and additions to criminal and criminal procedural legislation aimed at strengthening trust between the government and business, the formation of a fair law enforcement system that can effectively protect basic economic rights and freedom of entrepreneurship.

AB The use of ascriptive expressions leads us to the theory of constructing reality through the use of language. Since new objects, such as goals in football or crimes, are introduced into ontology by attributing statuses, it is necessary to determine the basis for this mechanism. The performative component of ascriptive expressions, which is a one-time performance of several actions, is defined. Firstly, this is a certain illocutionary act. Secondly, it is directly an ascriptive act, that is, the act of attributing a certain status to a certain position. The basis for the fulfillment of the illocutionary act is the intention of the agent, while the basis for the performance of the ascriptive act is a certain rule. If it is the act of attribution, and not the illocutionary act, that is related to the construction of reality, then it is necessary to identify the fundamental grounds for performing this kind of action. Since the question of following the rule when using ascriptive expressions in the framework of legal statements has already been raised within the framework of the analytical philosophy of law earlier, the analysis begins with the expressions of the legal language. It is demonstrated that a rule of law is not always a regulatory rule. At least some of the legal norms belong to a constitutive rule, that is, a rule that creates the possibility of some new activity. Furthermore, the expressions of everyday language are considered. It is demonstrated that the act of attribution is also carried out on the basis of constitutive rules, from which it is concluded that the construction of an ontology through the use of ascriptive expressions is possible when the individual has a corresponding rule. In a situation when an individual makes a mistake, an object introduced into the ontology can be "recalled", since ascriptive expressions have the property of cancellability.

AB The origin of human language is one of the most difficult issues of human sciences. The uniqueness of the language puts the natural-science worldview, in which the language appears to be an unprecedented evolutionary phenomenon, in a vulnerable position. At the moment, there is no answer to the question of which of the functions of the language - communicative or cognitive - played a key role in the evolution of human thinking? The main difficulty is that human language, the language of everyday communication, is used both to describe oneself and to describe the world of which one is a part. In terms of the logical doctrine defended by Bertrand Russell and Alfred Tarski, paradoxes are inevitable in the language used to describe oneself. The relativization of objects of cognition fixed in a semantically closed language makes any judgment about such a system of meanings unlawful. Thus, purely logical problems extend to the fundamental sections of philosophy, and the question of the origin of language is transformed into the question of the boundaries of reality and cognition. This article discusses the practical applicability of abstract knowledge in ordinary language at the intersection of epistemology, the foundations of mathematics, and psychopathology. The main aim of the work is to answer the question of how much the ideals of a pure theory meet the demands of everyday life, and whether they meet them at all. The contextualism of the later Ludwig Wittgenstein leads to the question of the abstract nature of metacommunicative statements. The logico-epistemological foundations of Gregory Bateson's theory of communication and psychopathology are explicated. The paradox of a negative self-referential meta-statement and ways to overcome it are analyzed. The impossibility of the principles of a hierarchical approach in the application to the tasks of ordinary communication is demonstrated. The conclusion is made about the inapplicability of the hierarchical model of metalanguages to the structuring of ordinary language and thinking.

TI BALANCE OF POWER BETWEEN THE U.S. AND RUSSIA (In estimates of American
   researchers)
SO MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE balance of power; decline of a great power; assessment of economic
   potential; place in the world
AB The American political and academic elite holds inconsistent views on the balance of power between the United States and Russian Federation. On the one hand, Russia is seen as a former great power that is in irreversible socioeconomic decline, which sooner or later should lead to a reduction of Russia's presence in the international arena. On the other hand, American circles are increasingly concerned about the strengthening of Russia's positions in the world in recent years, and even about Russian interference in the internal affairs of the leading Western countries. It is difficult to reconcile the thesis of a country in decline with that one of the ubiquitous Russian threat. Apparently, this inconsistency is explained not only by the imperfection of the methodology of assessment of the Russian (and not only Russian) capabilities, adopted in the United States, but also by perceptions of the U.S.' and Russia's place in the modern international relations system, deeply rooted in the minds of the American elite. One can state a huge gap between the United States and the Russian Federation in terms of their military and political ambitions scale. The U.S. claims to be the "only superpower" - the only country in the world capable of projecting its conventional military power globally. Modern Russia, unlike the Soviet Union, is not a global superpower. The Russian Federation positions itself as a great power that seeks to protect and ensure its interests in the international arena - but does not seek, unlike the USSR (and the modern United States), to remake the world in its own image. Naturally, the policy of protecting the national interests of even such a large country as Russia does not require the same extensive expenditures as the policy of inspiring the world proletarian (or, alternatively, liberal) revolution. The view of Russia as a "bully and troublemaker" (and not as a "normal" country that has the right to defend its national and state interests) will continue, as the author believes, to cause a distorted perception of real capabilities and intentions of the country.

DE ethics of technoscience; social practice; moral responsibility
AB The ethics of technoscience is complex in nature not only because it combines nanoethics, bioethics, information ethics, neuroethics, but also because it makes the problems of applied ethics providing the ethical reflection of technological innovations much broader, and makes philosophical ethics more complex by casting doubt on the ontological foundation of morality itself. The ethical discourse of technoscience is being formed. It integrates speculative studies of moral philosophy with the social practice of the humanities. The subject matter of technoscience ethics is not only the discussion and control of new technologies and practices, but also the identification and discussion of fundamental ethical, anthropological and ontological problems. The task of the ethos of technoscience is to predict the harmful and useful aspects of deployment. We can say that the essence of the ethos of technoscience in the moral regulation of the technosphere. The comparative analysis of such forms of technoscientific ethos as information ethics, bioethics, neuroethics, nanoethics has revealed that, in each case, researchers distinguish two patterns, defined as internal and external or micro- and macrolevels of normative ethical problems. Each of the considered forms of the ethos of technoscience is both a scientific discipline and a social practice. The critical function of technoscience ethos is associated with the assessment of the technological impact on the environment and humans. The philosophical context of technoscience ethics is associated with the need for a moral evaluation of the convergent technologies' impact on man and human nature. While traditional ethical teachings were based on metaphysical assumptions, this also applies to absolutist ethics based on a priori axioms of good and evil and utilitarian ethics which takes usefulness as a basis of a moral, the ethical discourse of technoscience is formed in a transdisciplinary field and is a form of social practice. Forms of activity such as social expert examination, responsible research and innovation (RRI), social assessment of technology, and deep ecology combine scientific research with various types of social practice. Here, science appears in a new humanistic dimension so that the developed technologies are in accordance with social values and ensure the sustainable development and survival of mankind. Based on the foregoing, the authors conclude that there is a significant modification of the ideal of the self-worth of scientific and technological innovations as the basic value of the anthropogenic civilization.

AB In modern Russia, despite many significant changes, the physical and social isolation of people with disabilities remains. However, people are increasingly manifesting themselves as active actors advocating in public space for the inclusion and accessibility of cities. Urban public space is a space located and created between people through speech and action. The authors refer to agency as an individual's ability to the socially important, political speaking and action. It appears if a person is visible, capable and willing to interact with others, to take on the initiative, be motivated not only by one's own interests, but also by the worldly attachment. The authors show what problems people with disabilities and other citizens face, what experience they gain in trying to find themselves in public spaces, to activate communication, and take on the initiative in collective interests. The article is based on Hannah Arendt's ideas that the authors apply to the analysis of 40 qualitative interviews collected in the summer of 2019 in Kazan, Samara, Saratov, and Tomsk with local experts activists, including ten interviews in the walk-along methodology. The study showed that public space is created as a web of connections and meanings between people in the interaction regarding the designation of their identity, communication with others, and initiatives on socially important issues. The performance of identity fills the space of communications with new emotions and meanings and is accompanied by various reactions of others. Thus, the scope and formats of publicity are changing, the space becomes more open and inclusive. Participation in public space does not automatically lead to a reduction in inequality or an increase in the accessibility of urban space. In the conditions when new social norms are not internalized by the majority of surrounders, institutions and other actors are needed to facilitate the participation of the less powerful in public space.

   Colonization Bank in 1914-1915

LA Russian
DT Article
DE Manchurian Agricultural Society; Sino-Eastern Railway; Colonization
   Bank; Far East Economy
AB Based on materials from the Russian State Historical Archive of the Far East and a number of other sources, the present article examines the activities of the Manchurian Agricultural Society (MAS). Founded in Harbin in 1912, MAS was actively involved in the developing of fertile land along the Sino-Eastern Railway (Kitaisko-vostochnaia zheleznaya doroga) strip. As the article points out, the leadership of the Company also came up with plans for the colonization of Northern Manchuria, the territory of which belonged to China. So far historians never considered the activities of MAS from this angle; MAS has so far been credited with the role of a conductor of Russian agricultural knowledge, through training specialists for agriculture in Manchuria and offering agro-technical education to the population living along the Sino-East Railway. Until Russia entered the First World War, MAS had some chances of obtaining support for its project in commercial and industrial circles, which were interested in strengthening Russian influence in northeast China. The author notes that serious adjustments in the activities of MAS were due to changes in the international political situation in 1914-1915. Circles in the Russian government were interested in maintaining friendly relations with their eastern neighbors, China and Japan. It is shown that in the changing political environment, without receiving support from the Russian government and the Governor-General of the Amur Province, the Company was able to redirect its activities. Its leadership concentrated on trying to create a special Colonization Society and a subsidizing Colonization Bank, whose funds were to be composed of shares, bonds, and treasury subsidies. The goal of this new Society and the Bank was to support Russia's economic undertakings in the Far East - the organization of agricultural and industrial enterprises, and the provision of financial and technical assistance to them. However, the First World War, which went very badly for Russia, did not allow for a realization of these plans. The problems of the colonization of the region were not resolved.

AB This article discusses a philosophical version of a new morality of the superhuman (a radical change / transformation of human nature) of society in the Singularity Era developed by David Pearce, one of the founders of the World Transhumanist Association. Hedonistic imperative or negative ethical utilitarianism must reasonably prove the groundlessness of the existence of traditional morality and such notions as pain, unhappiness, suffering, illness, and dispassion. Pearce offers several options and methods (search for a scientific method for measuring pleasure) with which it is possible to achieve a state of complete happiness "paradise engineering", constant pleasure, and the exclusion of any possibility of pain and physical suffering. In 2007 Pearce founded the Abolitionist Society which aims to eradicate suffering through artificial methods. According to Pearce, humanity has so far evolved according to the classical theory of the struggle for survival and reproduction, and therefore suffering was inevitable, and in the 21st century with the help of various technologies (designer drugs, genetic reproduction revolution, and nanotechnologies) people can abolish not only physical but also mental sufferings. The following question arises in this respect: to what extent is such a paradigm possible and will it lead to real happiness? Transhumanism is developing in all directions and provides an alternative vision not only of the future of mankind, the possibilities of high technologies, or the search for methods of achieving immortality, these are also analogs in the field of a philosophical fundamental vision of man, or rather superman, and a new model of morality for such a super-personality. At the religious level, Pearce developed the "Zero Ontology", which is an attempt to incorporate the idea of non-existence into the Western Christian ideological tradition. Transhumanism is based on the ideas of non-existence, evolution, and the pragmatism of hedonism and Singularity. Pearce forms not only a purely theoretical model of hedonistic imperative which will be included in a number of other moral versions, but he also argues about the almost accomplished choice and further transformations and the criteria for the selection of people into the society of "happy and non-suffering" creatures. The article analyzes the possibility of the practical and theoretical application of hedonistic imperative and "paradise engineering" along with the critical remarks about the transhumanist morality.

AB The article discusses the sociopsychological characteristics of sperm donors who participate in assisted reproductive technologies (ART) altruistically. The study is based on the survey of 86 respondents who were recruited on the site https://rebenku.biz and selected according to their willingness to donate sperm for ART without monetary compensation. The average age of the participants in the study was 37.4 (SD = 6.9 years). The participants (more than 50% of respondents) share a number of characteristics: they have a positive attitude to ART in general; they are graduates of higher education institutions; they adhere to a healthy lifestyle; they are not married and wish not to change their marital status in the future; they have their own children; they report average personal income (belong to the middle class) and assess their professional career as successful. At least 44% of the participants have previous experience of sperm donation, while 29% of the surveyed men have children conceived with the help of ART. In the classification of psychological needs, the author relied on Clayton Alderfer's model, in which three groups of needs are distinguished: existence; relatedness; growth and development. The survey helped identify most frequent motives for donation: altruistic motives ("the desire to help others", "to do something good in life"); reproductive motives ("to pass on your genes", "to have children, reproduction"); motives associated with personal experience or circumstances ("friends / family members are infertile"); the desire for self-affirmation and egoistic motivation. The content analysis and the author's classification of motives have shown that most respondents (71 out of 86) decided to donate due to only one type of need. The rest of the surveyed men were motivated by two types of needs simultaneously. The leading motive of the respondents was the need for existence (55%); then there follows the need for relatedness (41%) and the need for growth (14%). It should be noted that 26% of the respondents (i.e. 23 people) exhibited narcissistic and selfish traits, which is a significant percentage in our study, in particular because of the selection criteria.

DE global capitalism; business elite; transnational capitalist class;

AB The main players and key beneficiaries of globalization are the business elites of the world's major economies, which are incrementally uniting into a transnational capitalist class. Features of business elites that allow us to understand the future of their states and the whole world determine our interest in them. The author, based on the ratings of billionaires (Forbes, Hurun) and various statistical studies of millionaires, analyzes the main characteristics of the business elites of the planet. The number, wealth, gender composition, number of children, the degree of self-made quality, education, industry specialization, oligarchy, settlement in large cities are studied. To analyze the level of oligarchy of business elites, the author uses the layer proportions method and the method of dynamic middle age. Special attention is paid to the analysis of movements of business elites around the planet. Three forms of global mobility of billionaires and millionaires are distinguished: long-term, medium-term, and short-term. The main trends in the development of business elites of the world's major economies in 2020 and in previous years were rapid growth in numbers and wealth, a decrease in the western core and an increase in national heterogeneity, multilateral industry specialization, an increase in female presence, stable vertical social mobility, and a low degree of oligarchy (in most states), fairly even expansion (in most states), the rapid growth of global mobility. Russia's business elite is notable for its relatively small number, youthfulness, a high degree of self-made quality, masculinity, an extremely high orientation to work in the energy and raw materials sectors of the economy, an extremely high degree of oligarchy, over-concentration in Moscow, and a high degree of global mobility. The analysis of the Russian business elite allows concluding that Russia has developed a Moscow-centralized oligarchic and extensive-resource capitalism, which at the same time is an integral part of global capitalism.

DE Southeast Asia; Indonesia; Malaysia; Singapore; Philippines; terrorism;
   radical Islamism; ISIS; radicalization
AB The problem of terrorism is far from new for the countries of Southeast Asia. In the early 2000s, the legal and institutional framework was created for its solution. The use of predominantly hard methods allowed countries to succeed in defeating the terrorist underground. However, the situation sharply worsened with the advent of ISIS and the spread of its influence in the region, which leads to activation of its supporters. The methods of combating terrorism, tested for decades, were not enough to counter the growing threat. The ongoing changes in the social composition and structure of terrorism have required the adjustment of counter-terrorism policies - reinforcing its legal base and strengthening its humanitarian component. An analysis of successes and failures of this policy in relation to the four Southeast Asian countries facing the threat of Islamic terrorism (Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines) is the subject of this study. The article notes that the need for preventive measures is dictated by the process of radicalization of part of the Muslim population falling under the ideological influence of ISIS. Radicalization, as the author notes, occurs in different ways: through the Internet; acquaintance with Islamic propaganda literature and materials of ISIS; attending sermons of radical imams; studying in religious and secular educational institutions; in prisons; within a family or a clan. The fight against the spread of extremist ideology is the most difficult task facing the countries of the region today and requiring an integrated approach to its solution in cooperation with the Muslim community, civil society and business. The modern strategy of the fight against terrorism, aimed at narrowing its social base, includes the implementation of a set of measures - promoting deradicalization programs, counter-propaganda of the radical Islamism ideology, work with youth, etc. In the sum, the author concludes that, although the Southeast Asian countries have managed to avoid large-scale terrorist attacks, the situation may worsen at any time, which was confirmed by the events in the southern Philippines in 2017. The main thing for the Philippines in counter-terrorism remains the implementation of measures to improve the political and socio-economic position of the local population. Indonesia, in turn, faces great difficulties in the fight against terrorism, which cannot be overcome only by strengthening the powers of counter-terrorist agencies. Even deradicalization programs will not give the expected effect in a situation when the process of Islamization of the country accelerates. This problem also threatens Malaysia whose success in counter-terrorist activities can be minimized amid the politicization of Islam, which creates a breeding ground for the radicalization of part of the Muslim population, especially young people. The most important thing in the fight against terrorism, as the experience of Singapore shows, is mobilization of the whole society, close interaction of the state and population.

   Weber; rationality; modernity; values; progress; disenchantment
AB The article is devoted to Max Weber's famous lecture/essay "Science as a Vocation" in the context of today's assessment of science and technology. It is shown that the ideal type of scientist, drawn by Weber, remains in demand after a hundred years. On the one hand, Weber expresses a concrete historical cultural situation at the beginning of the 20th century in Germany. On the other hand, he occupies a universalist standpoint, based on abstract sociological models. Weber stresses the internal tension between the institutional (economic, political) conditions of the existence of science and the personal motivation of scientists. He believes that science and technology are responsible for the rationalization (disenchantment of the world), penetrating into all spheres of the theoretical and practical life of society. This rationalization leads to the fact that science loses its original transcendental meaning-knowable being, and turns into practical activity without an ultimate goal, guided by the institutionalized instrumental reason. Losing the transcendental meaning of their activities, scientists risk losing their vocation while maintaining a profession that becomes a function of the global bureaucracy. What, then, is the search for the meaning and value of science in the completely disenchanted world? This Weberian question is posed by social scientists today, which testifies rather against Weber's concept of rationalization. It is shown that Weber's pessimistic perspective concerning the dynamics of rationality is being revised today in the context of the so-called re-enchantment of the world. Reenchantment does not mean that the irrational, or the metaphysical, is forced out into the marginal or private spheres of social life (as it should have happened if we follow the logic of Weber's concept). On the contrary, it occurs in our collective (everyday and academic) scientific and technical culture. This suggests that science remains not only a profession, but also a vocation.

AB The article considers the main directions of migration policy outlined in Emmanuel Macron's policy statements (France, 2017) and government programs of recent years. This refers to the policy of France regarding the reception of refugees, student immigration, "family" immigration, immigration on the status of "passport talent", as well as immigration of professional and scientific personnel. The latest data on the number of immigrants in these categories are provided. The priority area of integration of immigrants is discussed in detail, as well as measures that are designed to improve the French integration model, including the system of reception and adaptation of newcomers. The discussion points of view on the current migration policy of the country by representatives of the main political parties, expressed at the debate in the National Assembly of France in November 2019, are investigated. 20 measures adopted by the government in November 2019 to change the French migration policy and make it more effective and more controllable are analyzed. The procedure for introducing quotas by profession and stages of its practical application are examined in detail. The issue of state spending on the reception of refugees and integration of immigrants is raised. Attention is drawn to the approach of E. Macron to the main problems of French migration policy and to the changes that occur during his presidency. Innovations related to strengthening cooperation with French citizens living outside of France, as well as expanding French education system abroad, are highlighted. The article discusses the statements of the presidential program, which, on the one hand, should strengthen the influence of French expatriates on the sociopolitical and economic life of France, as well as their representation in the country, and, on the other, solve the issue of their information and economic support.

DE profession; transfession; modern philosophy; classical philosophy;
   transdisciplinarity
AB The idea of a contributing role of philosophical thinking, which affects emergence, development, and change in the essence of a professional activity, is suggested as a methodological background for studying the concept of a profession in the article. A profession is a social construct undergoing historical transformations relevant to the transformations of a dominant way of rational thinking, which philosophy regards as a tool for creating the social world and all its components. Thus, the metaphysically oriented classical philosophy, which firmly determines a strong correlation between philosophical knowledge and the key term arche, is just as firmly arranged by a social structure. The first theoretical and methodological principles for shaping the concept of a profession appeared under the influence of the ancient Greek Logos. The final formation of a profession as a social institution and a concept specifying a particular community of people is associated with rationalism and cultural interests during the Renaissance and the early modern period. Among the well-established characteristics, by which this or that type of activity is now associated with the concept of a profession, the authors specify the recognition of the status of a profession as inaccessible to all other types of activity and the closeness of an institutional organization that requires specific education and training and assumes greater efficiency in achieving benefits than other types of occupations - a useful product. Modern philosophy and its way of rational thinking, which is different from the classical one, imposes different demands on the sociocultural structures of the world and on the concept of a profession. The social world is no longer based on a central metaphysical structure. In this regard, the characteristics that defined a profession earlier disappear or become transformed into completely different ones: multidimensionality, interdisciplinarity, openness, communicativeness, digitalization, etc. The characteristics of a transfessional include, first of all, tolerance to changes, the ability to communicate, transfessional competence, the ability to take on any role in temporary professional teams, etc. A transfessional is a person who is always ready and able to create and transform themselves with respect to new professional requirements. Thus, transfessions replace professions under the influence of a different way of thinking, which suggests the change in knowledge and education as constitutive factors of a profession that construct its new - transfessional - essence. A profession loses the transparency of its own structure and acquires the characteristics of continuous communicativeness, multiplicity of goals, intrinsic unity of competencies and knowledge in a wide range of sciences, both natural sciences and the humanities.

ID BIOMASS
AB Bioenergy remains the main source of renewable energy in EU. Unlike other renewables, biomass provides solution for decarbonisation of power generation, heating and cooling, and transport. In transportation and heating biomass effectively holds leading role because of lack of other mature and economically feasible low-carbon technologies. In the power generation sector, the role of bioelectricity is rather limited facing competitive wind and solar power. Nevertheless, bioelectricity is crucial for phasing out coal as it allows retaining thermal power plants through their conversion to biomass. Such conversion is especially important for combined heat and power plants (CHPs) as far as it enables decarbonisation of both electricity generation and heating sectors. Thermal bioelectricity can also balance the power grids with a higher share of intermittent renewable power supply. Despite outlooks for a resilient growth, bioenergy in the EU is facing strong criticism regarding CO2 emissions and associated carbon debt. Another issue is connected wtih ensuring sustainability of biofuels what engulfs a broad range of questions ranging from low-carbon production to biodiversity, ecosystem benefits and social impacts. EU climate and energy policy addresses those issues by passing corresponding regulations. Meanwhile some EU countries are facing strong political pressures from environmental groups and are introducing even more strict sustainability criteria for domestic biofuels production and consumption. Further enhancement of sustainability requirements in EU is possible, including those for imported biofuels. In a longer term a decrease of biomass share in EU renewables mix can be expected caused by political pressure on bioenergy as carbon-emitting technology and in a separate development as a consequence of innovations and growth of other competitive non-carbon technologies able to replace biofuels.

AB In developing countries, the business environment is more uncertain, so normally, companies must continually seek new ways to compete, based on their innovation capability. This is especially necessary in small businesses that are created as a way of subsistence of the entrepreneur and their family (subsistence small businesses). The innovation of subsistence small businesses is very important in poorer areas of developing countries. Usually, the innovation systems condition the innovation of the companies, but the small size and the peripheral region can condition this effect. The research analyzes the effect of the different typology of sources of knowledge to increase the innovation capability in these businesses, combining regression with partial least squares. The research shows that external and internal sources of knowledge are important to increase innovation capability, and informal sources of knowledge are more important that formal sources, suggesting political actions to improve this process.

AB The social and political position of the Russian Orthodox Church during the Russian-Ukrainian crisis of 2014 and the following religious and political conflict with the Constantinople Patriarchate in 2018-2019 is down to the ambition to defend its interests, the integrity of the Church, the interests of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, and to the intention to play an independent role in the post-soviet space. Ukrainian events accelerated many processes and made them more evident. The latter includes the changes in the worldview of the Russian Orthodox Church. During the crisis, the idea of independence from the state, State-Church separation, human rights including the freedom of conscience enjoyed a high-profile. The attempt to develop the dioceses and the mission outside the "canonical territory" of the Russian Orthodox Church (as a result of a church split with Constantinople) probably will remain a symbolic step. Meanwhile, the involvement in the global mission widens the horizon of the representatives of the Russian Orthodox Church. The globalization project developed by the Moscow Patriarchate has the potential to strengthen the Church position as the major civil institution on post-soviet space. The Ukrainian crisis didn't destroy Russian Orthodoxy but gave a new impetus to its progress.

AB The article aims to show theoretical approaches to President Trump's economic strategy, the major directions of his economic reforms, and their results and contradictions. The author reviews the background of Trump's economic ideas which have the roots in neoliberal economic schools and economic policy of former President R. Reagan. It is shown that Trump's economic ideology as well as practices contain a lot of internal contradictions. It is especially true for differences between his domestic quite liberal approach to economic policy which reflected in tax legislation and deregulation policy and protectionist foreign economic strategy which has nothing in common with liberal approach to foreign trade and economic globalization in general. Trump's economic reforms can be divided into two big groups - domestic economic policy and foreign economic policy. The domestic economic agenda includes very serious tax reform finalized into 2017 new tax legislation (The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act). The most important position of this law was a reduction of corporate taxes to the unified level of 21% for all corporations. Another important direction of economic policy was a policy of deregulation. In accordance with this policy hundreds of government acts issued by previous administration were canceled what allowed to save more than 30 Billion Dollars for only 2 years since 2017. The same time there is a lot of criticism in regards to both major policies on domestic scene - many economists keep saying that the tax reform led primarily to budget deficit increase and that regulatory reform is very inconsistent and not well elaborated. As to the foreign economic policy it raises even more questions. According to many opinions the rising protectionism may be much more harmful for the US economy than beneficial. Also it is very doubtful to have a large-scale return of American companies to the US territory promised by President Trump. The current trends of reshoring are very modest. The US Administration also failed to balance the foreign trade which also was one of the most important goals of Trump's economic agenda. Several other important goals of Trump's administration were also not achieved. Among them - to cancel Affordable Care Act ("Obamacare ''), passed during Mr. Obama presidency, to pass a new immigration law, to start massive infrastructure reform. The author makes a conclusion that despite the economy is still in a pretty good shape the most important goals of Thump's administration were not achieved or were only partly accomplished. It is clear that political future of D. Trump will significantly depend on economic situation in 2020.

The strongest voice for its independence has risen in the first decade of the current century. Analyzing the comprehensive, convincing and fact-rich book "Nationalism in Catalonian history: the past and the future" written by A.A. Orlov, the article highlights the relevance of this truly encyclopedic work for the Russian historical and political science, explores the recent developments in Catalonia, the mistakes of the central power in Madrid in its relationship with the regional administration and the unlearned lessons from the separatists' side. The danger for the government and P. Sanchez personally is to become the hostage of the Catalonian separatists and make any concessions in order to maintain power. Nothing is known about finding a mutually acceptable compromise and the solution.

DT Article
DE Pope Francis; Catholic Church; Vatican; Italian Episcopal Conference;

AB This article analyzes the main areas of activities of the Catholic Church in Italy during the coronavirus pandemic in the Spring of 2020. The Italian Episcopal Conference endorsed "fully- fledged cooperation" with the civil authorities in order to contain the epidemiological danger, including a ban on liturgical gatherings. This decision raised the question of whether the violations of human and civil rights, in particular, freedom of religion, under the pretext of the common good are justified. The author concludes that the unwillingness to enter into conflict with the State, even when dealing with the fundamental principles of Christianity, does not indicate the subordination of the Church to the State. It rather indicates the desire to maintain political neutrality, to fulfill the pastoral mission and policy of non-violence. However, the author highlights that the civil authorities were not ready to maintain a constructive dialogue with believers because they underestimated or even ignored the importance of the Transcendent in their lives. The coronacrisis revealed the existing problematic "areas" in attitude toward religion in secular society.

AB The article is devoted to the history of the formation in the second half of the XIX century of management bodies in settlements that arose in the Kalmyk lands. The features of this process on the territory of the Kalmyk ulus and the factors that influenced it are revealed, the evolution of the state administrative and territorial policy is considered, and the attitude of various state administrative structures to the solution of this issue is analyzed.
   The author comes to the conclusion that the formation of the administrative-territorial structure and management in the resettlement villages on the Kalmyk lands had its own specifics, due to the tasks solved by the Imperial decree of December 30, 1846, the geographical factor, and features of the process of settlement and management of the Kalmyk people.
   The Russian ruling circles during the period of formation in the settlement villages on the Kalmyk lands of management and administrative-territorial structure conformed their actions to the existing circumstances and the current situation, thus showing a certain political flexibility. At the same time, they were not going to abandon the main goal of administrative and territorial policy, which was to gradually unify the system of government in different parts of the state.

DE ecumenism; Enlightenment; reason; postmodernism; supernatural
AB The interest in ecumenism in socio-philosophical research is probably associated with the fact that the spread of ecumenical ideas since the second half of the 20th century is a part of a postmodern cultural transformation. Modern ecumenism, including projects of unification of religions, may try to erode or eliminate the supernatural, since it defines the particularity of a religion and, therefore, prevents the unification of religions. The complex attitude to the supernatural, demonstrated by modern ecumenist projects, seems to be connected with the Enlightenment cult of reason, which not only dictated the need for social reform on a rational basis, but was also imbued with the fear of the irrational (including the supernatural). Thus, the origins of modern ecumenism can be seen in the cult of reason of the Enlightenment period. The study of the Enlightenment origins of modern ecumenism can be focused on the peculiarities of the philosophy of language, especially on the problem of the relation between language and religion. The philosophy of language of the Enlightenment is associated with social criticism. Within the framework of social analysis, religion is also comprehended: according to the Enlighteners, it does not provide for the common good, but can be transformed. This is the description of the ecumenical project of a universal religion of the Enlightenment. The philosophy of the Enlightenment gave modern ecumenism a few features: (1) the idea of morality as a result of cognitive activity, i.e., a link between ethics and epistemology; (2) the recognition of the need to reform religion on a rational basis; (3) the understanding of religion as justice; (4) the erosion or elimination of the supernatural. The analysis of the postmodern formulation of the philosophy of language also allows seeing some ecumenical projects as a "meeting" of the Enlightenment discourse with the radically different, i.e., the supernatural. The reforms of religion (including ecumenism) commit to resist the fear of the supernatural by appropriating religion, making it quite inconsistent with its essence.

DE climate change law in Russia; polluter-pays principle
AB The Russian Federation is the fourth largest producer of greenhouse gas emissions in the world. The article is a study of how these emissions are monitored in Russia. In the framework of the polluter-pays principle (ppp), the current Russian legislation on pollutants provides for payment only for methane emissions. No payments are established for any of the other greenhouse gases. The authors conclude that, at present, Russian legislation does not regulate action against climate change, although many political and legal documents are being adopted aimed at adapting to the effects of climate change. A draft statute "On State Regulation of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Absorption and on Amendments to Certain Legislative Acts of the Russian Federation" is analysed. Despite the fact that this draft law is strongly opposed by the affected industries, the authors conclude that the adoption of this law and the creation of a targeted national climate fund will contribute to the implementation of the ppp in Russia for the purpose of combating climate change.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE India; China; Indo-Pacific; Africa; South Asia; Indian Ocean; Southeast
   Asia
AB The article is devoted to studying the Indian attitude to the economic growth and increasing of political influence of China. The author analyzes the history of Sino-Indian relations, arguing that it is historical experience that determines the Indian attitude towards China. He notes the ambiguity of the historical experience: on the one hand, Indian and Chinese civilization have been coexisting side by side for at least two thousand years, and on the other, India has distrust of China after the 1962 war. This historical experience forms an ambiguous Indian position: India considers China as an eternal neighbour, but at the same both states claim to be the regional leader. The author considers three areas of clash of Indian-Chinese interests - South Asia and the Indian Ocean, Southeast Asia and Africa. In the immediate neighborhood, India is unhappy with any intervention by China; in Southeast Asia, India and China are competing for influence, trying to strengthen their relations with ASEAN. In Africa, Indian and Chinese companies do not compete, but cooperate. The author comes to the conclusion that in all three zones, India is more or less tolerant of the growth of China's economic presence, while taking very painfully any attempts at military and political expansion. India itself avoids actions that could lead to an aggravation of relations with China, preferring to increase economic influence and act with soft power and, if necessary, use its political and cultural influence to bring the pro-Indian politicians to power. The article also considers the evolution of the Indo-Pacific concept, which was conceived as a project to contain China, but is gradually turning into a historical and economic basis for expanding Indian influence to the east. The author concludes that India is committed to the format of 'contest-and-cooperation' and will refrain from participating in any anti-Chinese blocs as well as from an alliance with China in the near future.

AB Discussions on the alleged methodological specificity of social knowledge are fueled to not the least extent by a kind of retarded position of the latter against technological advancements of natural and information science based on exact methods and formal or quantitative languages. It is more or less obvious that applicability of exact scientific methods to social disciplines is highly dependent on a chosen conception of social reality, i. e., on social ontology. In the article, the author critically approaches the ontological views of Tony Lawson and proposes a computational view on social ontology that is supposed to eliminate some internal contradictions of Lawson's realist conception.

DE risk in sociology; educational risks; personality; personal results
AB The authors believe that scientific approaches to the designation of risk theory can expand understanding of the problem of personal development. An analysis of theoretical studies has shown that management plays a large role in solving the risk problem. The content of the concepts "risk in sociology", "educational risks", "personal results" is analyzed. The main aim of this article is to identify the risks of personal development in the educational process of a modem Russian school (based on an assessment of personal results). The study was carried out in 2018-2019, in seven general educational organizations in Novosibirsk and Novosibirsk Oblast. 513 students and 24 classroom teachers took part in it. In order to determine the level of the formation of the criteria for personal development, classroom teachers were offered an assessment card containing a list of indicators, and students were offered a self-assessment card reflecting the experience of participation in specific activities for schoolchildren. Two groups of risks were identified: subjective and objective. Subjective include risks associated with the assessment system, expertise and mechanisms for the formation of personal development. Objective risks indicate limited conditions and resource support, the absence of certain managerial decisions. The results of the empirical study made it possible to develop a resource matrix for implementing the requirements of the Federal State Educational Standard, to determine an algorithm for assessing personal results, including organizational elements, and to prepare a teacher development program for teachers on personal development problems. These measures, in the authors' opinion, will help reduce the risks of personal development in the educational process. The presented approaches to the classification of personal development risks will make it possible to introduce changes in the development of the modern Russian system of school education.

The history of the emergence and use of electronic survey methods by research companies. The main researchers engaged in the study and application of Internet surveys in Russia and abroad are listed. The differentiation of research on the Internet (broadcasting, phenomenological and innovative) is presented. An attempt is made to review modern quantitative survey methods of sociological research that have appeared in recent years in Russia and abroad. Quantitative surveys based on the use of telephone and computer are considered: telephone surveys using a computer (SATI), personal interviews using a computer (CAPI), tracking studies (CATI2web). The article provides an overview of the main quantitative survey methods based on the use of the Internet: e-mailsurvey; web-survey; surveys through social networks, forums, in groups; surveys based on free and paid platforms; online panels. The main advantages, limitations, disadvantages, and ways to overcome them using each of these types of electronic research are characterized. The principles of application of the concept "modular surveys", the management of remuneration for completing the questionnaire, the inclusion of verification questions, and changes in the design of questionnaires using infographics are described. The possibility of implementing the functions of timing control, control, kapcha, and routing technology are considered. Combined technologies based on the use of mobile communication and the Internet are reviewed: mobile surveys (via SMS, Java-applications, filling out questionnaires via the mobile Internet) and surveys by QR-code. The experience is analyzed of development and conducting surveys using elements of computer games and the principles of gamification: in the form of research games, gamification, games, entertainment, quests. The positive and negative aspects of their use in sociology are considered.

AB The article is devoted to the features of the Indian development model, describes the experiments and prospects for its further economic and sociopolitical modernization. The growth of the Indian economy outstrips the growth of any other economy in the world, demonstrates enviable dynamism and adaptability. The successes of Indian modernization are associated not only with its economic achievements, but also with peculiarities of its path of sociopolitical and cultural transformations. The particular religious experience of Indian civilization can serve as a world laboratory for overcoming the most acute contradictions of modernity and postmodernity. One of the first acute problems faced by India was poverty. Ethno-religious minorities were the least socially protected stratum of Indians. Therefore, since the mid 1970s in India the Positive Discrimination policy was established. Within this policy, not only representatives of Dalits are the subjects for the state support of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, but also Other Backward Classes. The specifics of its implementation had a number of negative consequences, such as corruption and the growing influence of regional caste parties. A significant place in the article is devoted to the growth of a new middle class in India and its role in the liberalization of the country. A sharp increase of the middle class occurred at the turn of 2010-2020s. Particularly indicative is its high growth dynamics in rural areas, where, unlike inprevious periods, it grew faster than its urbanized part. The results of the 2019 elections clearly indicated the decisive role of the lower middle class, which is gaining increasingly political weight.

AB Japanese theories of international relations (IR) turn into an increasingly important subject of research by Russian political scientists as Russia progressively orientates toward the East. The research task of this article is to approach the understanding of the origins and current landscape of Japanese theoretical thought in IR, explaining its cultural, historical and political condition. Using the historical-genetic method, the author restores the stages of the genesis of the Japanese theoretical understanding of IR, painting a picture of historical continuity that helps to understand the political thinking of today's Japanese. The author investigates the concepts of the contemporary Japanese theorists - Inoguchi Takashi, Tanaka Akihito, Anno Tadashi, - and other political scientists who determine the main trends of Japanese IR theories, which are the regional comparative studies (primarily Asian studies), specifically Japanese understanding of the soft power concept, political aspects of environmentalism, discourse of differences and a common denominator of Western and non-Western IR theories. Of practical importance is the analysis of the discussion of Japanese international affairs specialists on the transformation of Japan into an "ordinary country", which has the prospect of rejecting the "peaceful" 9th article of the Japanese constitution and the historically established pacifist identity of the Japanese nation behind it. The author concludes that the most noticeable contribution of Japanese political scientists to world political science is the creative transformation and enrichment of Western concepts with non-Western approaches to world order.

AB The aim of this article is to explore the characteristics of the new model of PhD programs (using the case of SPSU) and to test the following hypothesis: the new model of PhD programs in Saint-Petersburg State University (SPSU) is relevant and useful for innovative development and knowledge economy formation. The hypothesis was tested according to the following tasks: 1) Analysis of the cooperation of main actors or dialog between actors in the case of the Faculty of Political Science (SPSU); 2) Estimate of changes in completion rates in the case of the Faculty of Political Science at SPSU; and 3) Exploration of the motivations of PhD students in the case of the Faculty of Political Science at SPSU. The new model of PhD programs affects the structure of communication and coordination channels between all stakeholders. It also supports the necessity of such incorporation channels for the development of educational programs. Network analysis shows that SPSU is the main actor in the decision-making processes for the development of methodological and scientific programs. Other governmental bodies, NGOs, and institutes are also included in this process. Discourse analysis and a review of questionnaire data show the first perceptions of the new model of PhD program. The new model is changing the completion rates by introducing a new measurement: the Diploma "Researcher. Teacher-Researcher". An overview of general competences at SPSU proved that core competences of this program correlate with soft skills and encourage the development of systematic and critical thinking, project management and cooperation skills. In addition they provide the possibility to build inter-cultural channels of self-development and to work with information.Y

   Dostoevsky
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL

DE Dostoevsky; Austria; geopolitics; A Writer's Diary; Metternich; Balkans
ID WRITERS-DIARY; SLAVS
AB Fyodor Dostoevsky and his works are of considerable interest to both Russian and foreign researchers. At the same time, certain issues have practically not been considered in historiography. In particular, his geopolitical ideas were reduced mainly to a discussion of the pressing Eastern Question. In the framework of this article, attention is focused on Austria-Hungary, one of the key states in the world politics of the 19th century. The methodological basis of the work is the ideas of subjectivism and the possibilities of a symbolic mapping of the world realized through the creation of a certain picture or a verbal description of the map based on the mental schema, which is theoretically justified in Russian political science. In the framework of this study, this model was applied to recreate an imaginary map of Austria-Hungary in Dostoevsky's A Writer's Diary and notebooks. An analysis of the specified materials made it possible to identify five cases that reveal the image of Austria-Hungary in Dostoevsky's work: Chancellor Klemens von Metternich and his policy as a representation of the essence of Austria; Austria as the "younger brother" of Prussia/the German Empire; Austria as opposing Germany, on the one hand, and Russia, on the other; Austria as a "helper" and "patron"/"treacherous conqueror" of the southern Slays; Austria as located in the "most advantageous geopolitical position", or the end of the "patchwork empire". The elaboration of each of the cases made it possible to come to a number of interesting conclusions regarding the representation of Austria-Hungary as an object of Dostoevsky's geopolitical and ideological views. Dostoevsky sees Austria-Hungary primarily from the perspective of an antagonist of the Russian Empire, for which Vienna is one of the main geopolitical (struggle for the Balkans and southern Slays) and ideological (Orthodoxy against Catholicism) enemies. On Dostoevsky's imaginary map, Austria is surrounded by enemies and even Germany is only a temporary ally, since there are contradictions between them at the civilizational level (Catholicism against Protestantism). In addition, Berlin and Vienna see too many desirable territories owned by each other: the German-speaking territories in Austria-Hungary for the former, and the South German Catholic territories in the German Empire for the latter. In summary, it can be stated that Austria-Hungary ultimately represents a classic "patchwork empire", full of disparate elements, which allows Dostoevsky to predict its quick collapse, despite some current achievements obtained thanks to the fast new battle between France and Germany, the instability of Russia's positions, as well as the final weakening of the "sick man of Europe".

   regional disparities; development strategy
AB In consequence of the 1991 economic reform, India has become one of the world's fastest growing economies and evolved into a new center of attraction regionally and globally. Meanwhile, the postreform development model has accumulated a lot of constraints, particularly a high percentage of the people living below poverty line and exacerbation of regional disparities. These unresolved problems hamper geopolitical and geoeconomic aspirations of the country. The architects of reforms have ever emphasized the need to accompany high economic growth by more equitable distribution of income among the general population. This means that economic reforms must be provided with appropriate changes of political institutions reflecting cooperative nature of "centre-state relations". In 2014, Bharatiya Janata Party was able to perceive an urgent request of the Indian society for changes. The government primary tasks emanated from progressive trends of socio-economic and political development were as follows: firstly, to strength the infrastructure; secondly, to attract the foreign direct investments; thirdly, to attain the financial inclusion of the people; fourthly, to create an enabling business environment; and fifthly, to encourage the manufacturing sector. Despite the ongoing efforts improvement in the agricultural sector, some Indian states continue to be shaken by farmers' protests. In that way the farmers appeal to the authorities to intensify the implementation of a comprehensive problem solution in the farm sector. It was suggested that this theme will be one of the key issues of the BJP's strategy plan in apre-election phase. The article points out that under present-day conditions, transformation development model includes the continuation of economic reforms initiated in the early 1990s. The author reveals that the main intention of the transformative development strategy after the 1991 reform was to engage the most vulnerable (in economic and social regard) population groups and sections as well as backward states in economic growth. The article also examines the initiatives of Narendra Modi's government and their results attained in terms of strengthening the socio-economic integration.

DE crisis; disaster; risk; city; urbanism; uncertainty; culture; alienation
AB The article is devoted to the problem of the crisis consciousness of modern man. The author aims to form a relevant reflection on social processes from the position of strategies of activity in a crisis, transitive, dynamic society. In this regard, the method of critical analysis is used for rethinking the firm ideas established in science and for identifying the prerequisites for the formation of a crisis culture in society. The study examines the concepts of social risk, catastrophic future prediction, analyzes situations of threats from society development. Conclusions are drawn about the formation of a "culture of crisis" in modern society. Crisis, both real and imaginary, its forecasting, calculation of its risks became a way of social and political systems' existence. The idea of crisis as a way of regulating human activity and generating a change in the social paradigm gives reason to talk about it as a specific cultural phenomenon, since it is in culture that the system of historically developing supra-biological programs of human activity (behavior, communication), ensuring the reproduction and change of social life, is determined. The main factor in the formation of the "culture of crisis" is urbanism as modern man's way of life which creates conditions for the birth of psychological or mental crisis characterized by a state of fear, anxiety, irrationality of thinking. Psychological crisis is easily controlled: it can be provoked, aggravated, the way out of it can be blocked; this factor becomes a condition for the development of the "crisis industry", offering a wide range of means to combat the growing anxiety. Crisis mongering and experiencing are a social tool that can not only set the apathetic masses in motion, but also extract financial income from their state; in this connection, the tendency of a purposeful immersion of a person into this state through culture (media, art, architecture, etc.) is observed. Fear, elevated to the rank of culture and justified by scientific research, inhibits critical thinking, reason dissolves in the panic of the people horrified by the future. The absurdity of such a state creates an ideal situation for governance: the masses are ready to accept any paradigm just to get rid of this fear. Thus, the idea of the crisis as a way of regulating human activity gives reason to spaek about it as a specific phenomenon of urban culture.

DE reflection; construction of meanings; professional position of teacher;
   social apathy
AB The article analyzes the constructing of a professional position of a teacher, which, according to the authors, is a necessary condition for adaptation and further successful functioning at school. The proposed approach to solve the common problems of teachers is based on the concept of social apathy and on the results of focus group and narrative interviews of teachers conducted in 2018-2019 in Tomsk and in other regions of Western Siberia. The article shows the reasons of social apathy in the modern educational system. They are directly related to the problem of semantic alienation, consumption attitudes to work and the transformation of values. The states of alienation, burnout, and apathy among teachers deprive teaching activities of high meanings for which they could make efforts to improve their unique practices. A stable and proactive professional position, according to the authors, is the main means to prevent these conditions and a guarantee that the teacher will be able to qualitatively perform the duties and design the meanings of their own activities, even in difficult institutional conditions. The usage of the teacher's life world was of great importance for understanding the processes of teachers' adaptation to the modern reality. Narrative interviews clearly demonstrated that teachers who agreed on their own goals, values, and "rules of the game" at school feel the most comfortable. The authors suggest a classification of strategies for adapting teachers to the modern educational system based on the results of the study. It includes negative ("apathetic") and positive ways of teachers' adaptation which allowed determining reflection and working with meanings as the most important practices for teachers in the field of conscious planning of their work and rest, reflection on their emotional state, construction of the importance of self-development and cooperation with coworkers. Positive abstraction, development orientation, perspective vision of the situation, accepting strategy, innovative strategy, adaptation through a mentor or through insight into the stories of other teachers-all these strategies are inherently the opposite of social apathy because they incorporate the motives of movement, cooperation, acceptance and achievement.

DE gender inequality; parliament; lawmaking; gender norms
AB The reduction of gender inequality is one of the tasks, which should be solved by democratic countries. This work should be done not only by the state, but also by women themselves. The analysis of women's political participation has many directions. In the scientific literature, there are works about the history of the women's movement and the struggle for their right to obtain suffrage, there are articles devoted to the representation of women in governmental structures, including legislative ones. The authors highlight two important points: the lack of gender parity (the number of women is noticeably smaller than the number of men); the existence of horizontal gender segregation in parliaments (there are "women's" and "men's" commissions and committees). However, there are much fewer surveys which describe what female deputies do in parliament. The theory of "male domination" by Pierre Bourdieu and the concept of "voluntary consent to domination" suggest that female deputies will not go beyond their gender role in order to remain in politics. The reason for it is the dominance of traditionalist gender norms. In other words, female deputies are not to reconsider the traditional gender order and therefore reduce gender inequality. To test this hypothesis, an empirical research was made using quantitative methodology. The object of the research was the activity of female deputies of the Legislative Assembly of Saint Petersburg. This regional parliament was chosen for the study because of the high proportion of women in it (24%). This is one of the highest rates in Russia. The subject of the study was the degree of representation of interests of women as a social group in the activities of female parliamentarians. The method of collecting information was the content analysis of legislative initiatives and deputy requests in 2016-2018. The results of the study confirmed that the solution of social problems and the protection of women's interests is not a priority in the activities of female deputies of Saint Petersburg parliament. Only 17% of their legislative issues are devoted to social issues, only 11% of parliamentary requests directly affect the interests of women. Thus, the quantity of women in the regional parliament did not turn into quality, which is the creation and adoption of laws in the interests of women. An important area of the future research may be a comparative analysis of women's parliamentary activities in various regional parliaments of Russia. It will make it possible to consider not only the socio-demographic characteristics of the deputies, but also the features of the region, such as the level of economic development, history, culture, denominations, etc.

AB Introduction. The real situation in the economic, political and educational spheres hinders the development of intellectual and professional resources of technical intelligentsia. The purpose of the study is to identify objective conditions and subjective factors that determine the labor activity of modern Russian technical intelligentsia as a personnel basis for socio-economic changes and innovative transformations in the country.
   Materials and Methods. Official statistics and legislative acts were used as the materials for an analysis of the objective conditions. The methodological principles of historicism and socio-historical continuity, the methods of mathematical statistics were applied. When interpreting subjective factors, the empirical data obtained using the methods of the mass survey 'Modernization of the Economy and Technical Intelligentsia" and the expert survey "Innovative Activity of Technical Intelligentsia" were examined. The surveys made it possible to reveal technical intelligentsia's opinion - an assessment of current events in terms of adaptation to market relations and crises of recent years, job satisfaction, material remuneration for one's work, value orientations.
   Results. The study made it possible to identify the objective conditions (the economic situation of the country, the state of institutions of education, etc.) and the subjective factors (the degree and level of labor adaptation of technical intelligentsia to the ongoing socio-economic transformations of recent decades, job satisfaction, etc.) that characterize modern Russian technical intelligentsia. The performed analysis of these conditions and factors indicates the difficulties for implementing a large-scale innovative breakthrough both in Russia's economy and society as a whole.
   Discussion and Conclusion. Modern objective conditions determining the development of technical intelligentsia do not contribute to the completion of its traditional social mission - to be the pillar of scientific, technological and innovative transformations. The article is of practical importance for government agencies at various levels, for public organizations working to improve policies in the field of innovation in industry, science and education. Empirical data can be used for further scientific interpretations, as well as for diagnostics and advice on targeted support to enterprises and organizations in the productive sector.

AB The research is devoted to the assessment of the level of political competition in the party systems and representative bodies of the power of the regions of Russia. In the article, conditions of the formation of regional party systems in Russia in the 2000s are described, the political value of the party reform of 2012 is shown, and a chronological framework of the research is grounded. Conclusions of the article are based on the statistical data of the Central Election Commission of the Russian Federation about the results of the elections to the legislative assemblies of the territorial subjects of the Russian Federation which took place in 2012-2016. Such indicators as the number of parties participating in elections, the share of votes/seats of the winning party, and also the index of the effective number of parties (ENP) used in comparative political science calculated by G.V. Golosov's formula are applied to measure the level of competition between parties. This index is used in the article in two versions: (1) the effective number of electoral parties - for competition assessment in elections and (2) the effective number of parliamentary parties - for competition assessment in the elected legislative authority. Besides, to create a uniform scale, a new indicator - the average effective number of parties-is introduced. On its basis, the rating of regions of Russia on the competition level in the party systems is made. In the article, the conclusion is drawn that, with the tendency to unification, a variety of party systems in Russian regions is empirically observed. Regional party systems differ from each other in the number of offices of political parties, degree of their participation in elections, level of support of parties, and also the parliamentary group structure of legislative assemblies. United Russia's domination in regional elections in combination with the effect of a "fabricated majority" gave it hegemony as a part of the deputy corps even in the regions where the votes for this party were low. In general, the low level of competition in regional party systems is noted. However, the rating allows distinguishing two groups of regions in the regions of Russia. The first group is regions for which political competition is not characteristic at all. It is the Republic of Tuva, Kemerovo Oblast, the Chechen Republic, the Republic of Mordovia, Sevastopol. The second group of regions has a rather high level of political competition. It includes the Republic of Karelia, Altai Krai, Omsk and Kirov Oblasts, Primorsky Krai, and Novgorod Oblast.

AB In connection with the expanding influence of technology on all aspects of life, a sense of anxiety, uncertainty, instability is growing in society. An independent and very important challenge to human development is the growing inequality of people from different countries and domestic inequality. The world community, defining the Millennium Development Goals, focuses on the need to ensure freedom of choice of people based on the development of their abilities and empowerment. The article discusses the objective and subjective conditions under which the realization of human freedom becomes possible. The content of freedom is considered, which includes not only "dropping bonds" and expanding freedom of choice, but also responsibility for choices made. In connection with the development of Internet technologies, there is a risk of losing the humanistic basis of society, and, as a result, humanistic values are relativized, and interactions between people are largely formed independently of people themselves, which, in turn, reduces the possibilities of life choice and human freedom. The uncertainty of life plans (goals) is growing. Goal-setting is dominated by consumption, not by creativity, professional and spiritual growth. Such a bias in life goals reflects objectively unresolved social problems, and not only in Russia. The acquisition and preservation of personal freedom can be ensured by a state of society in which dignity, responsibility, and welfare of society members are basic characteristics, and they determining people's well-being. To ensure social well-being, it is necessary to develop such fundamental aspects of society as culture, education, social welfare. Inequality in incomes, access to high-quality education, healthcare, technology, etc. introduces a deep imbalance in the possibilities of human development and alternatives to people's choice. Moreover, in the third millennium, a generation of talented, educated, healthy, responsible, creative, i.e., free people should become the main wealth. Freedom involves building actions aimed at the well-being of society and man.

AB The article is devoted to a modern method of data extraction from the Web, web scraping, and its scientific significance and applicability in sociological studies. Based on trends across empirical sociological studies, concepts of digital sociology, science and technology studies (STS), computational sociology, and issues raised at recent international committees' meetings, the current research gives a definition of web scraping and presents an overview of its both methodological and technical opportunities, challenges, and limitations. Advantages and shortcomings are classified across a set of methodological, technical, judicial, ethic, financial, and professional issues and can serve as a perfect framework to be referenced to while weighing risks and rewards at the stage of research design. Comparison with conventional sociological methods, such as survey, in-depth interview or focus group, which lack response rates and have semantic distortions, holds prospects for web scraping as for a method that enables information extraction towards entire population in a timely and structured manner. According to sociology and the philosophy of science, the research aims to determine a place for the method of web scraping in the structure of sociological and scientific knowledge. By alleging to theories of scientific revolutions, science of synergies and the Vienna Circle ideas, the present study tries to prove that, under the circumstances of a shifting reality, scientific knowledge transforms correspondingly, and research questions imposed to the relevance and scientific meaningfulness of the new theory and its new methods are extremely prompt and expose the necessity of methodology conceptualization. This research is designed to overcome the stigmatization around studies, in which informational bases are mainly constituted by web-platform data. Dealing with online platforms, web scraping is successfully embedded into digital sociology and has potential in covering topics on platform economy. This article urges modern sociologists not to be frightened of learning new instruments and turning their research into interdisciplinary sociological studies. Web scraping benefits interdisciplinary research at the expense of its ability in the simplification of scientific verification processes.

AB The article discusses the problems and issues of further development of Russian grain exports. The main export grain crop for Russia is wheat; the volume of wheat supplies to the world market exceeds 35 million tons. The study provides a list of the main geographical areas importing Russian wheat and analyzes the dynamics of changes in its supply. However, the export orientation for wheat leads to imbalances in the structure of production and regional distribution of grain crops in Russia. Grain is of fundamentally high importance for solving the problem of import substitution for the production of meat and daily products and ensuring food security for the population of Russia; therefore, the study emphasizes the need for state management of the grain balance. In the long term, the regulation of grain exports should be reduced mainly to a system of economic measures, but at the moment, government participation is necessary as a driver in the development of production and logistics infrastructure. The complex of economic and political factors determines the diversification of wheat supplies from Russia due to the Far Eastern direction.

TI Modern Russian Historiography of Colonization of the Steppe Region in
   the Second Half of the 19th - Early 20th Centuries

DT Article
DE historiographic tradition; discourse; agrarian colonization; empire
AB Based on studies of the agricultural colonization of the steppe region in the post-Soviet period, the article outlines the key approaches of the Russian historiographical tradition, which enshrines the principles of scientific reflection in the evaluation of the Imperial Russian experience in the second half of the 19th century. The study identifies the stages of formation, development and evolution of the historiographical tradition of the question due to the influence of different contexts in the 1990s-2000s. It is established that the initial period of Russian historiography (second half of the 1990s) was characterized by preserved inertia research in the evaluation of the agrarian-colonial activities of the Russian Empire in the steppe region. With the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the Soviet historiography concept of the voluntary nature of the steppe region's annexation by Russia ceased to be relevant and was roundly criticized. In the early 1990s, it was not possible to conduct research in the field of the agricultural development of the steppe region, which was predetermined by the format of the organization of historical science in the USSR. The history of the borderlands and national minorities of the Empire in the pre-revolutionary and Soviet period was a "subordinate knowledge" which was formed and disseminated by Russian researchers. In the context of state independence, the agrarian colonization in the Republic of Kazakhstan became a subject of sharp controversy, in which colonization was presented as a national trauma. In the methodological crisis of the time, the reaction of Russian historiography on this issue was political correctness and silence. The second phase of the institutionalization of the Russian historiography of the agrarian colonization of the steppe region (mid-1990s-2016) was marked by the introduction of Western research methodological concepts in the context of Russian historical science. This process occurred in a favorable sociocultural and scientific background, the signs of which was the ideologization of scientific knowledge, interdisciplinarity in the coverage of agrarian and colonization processes in Russia. The theory and practice of "new imperial history" created prerequisites for expanding the horizons of scientific knowledge and going beyond the regional approach to the study of agricultural colonization of the borderlands, which contributed to the constructive interaction between the Russian and Kazakh historians.

AB The article deals with current German economic issues and uncovers a number of German competitive advantages compared with other European Union members. The author focuses on the role of social market economy as a common platform for political parties in Germany. Another significant factor is a highly developed industry, especially manufacturing, which provides a constant positive balance in foreign trade drawing displeasure among EU member States. Gradually, Germany is introducing the latest achievements of scientific and technological progress, such as Internet, artificial intelligence, digitalization etc., which enjoy significant support of the Federal authorities. A significant gap remains in the levels of development of the western and eastern territories. The shadow economy is not defeated, the crisis continues, demography is still unfavorable, etc. At the same time, increasing international tension does not help to overcome the accumulated difficulties in the economy and society, but also creates new barriers for the country itself. The anti-Russian sanctions, which are renewed every six months by the European Union, including Germany, act in the same direction. The author made a conclusion that there is no alternative to multilateral cooperation.

AB The results of a comprehensive sociological diagnostic analysis of the current state and dynamics of postreform Russian society and the social consequences of post-Soviet transformations, which began almost 30 years ago, are presented. The empirical basis of this paper is the data of numerous nationwide sociological studies, carried out by the Institute of Sociology, Federal Center of Theoretical and Applied Sociology, Russian Academy of Sciences, at crucial stages of societal reform, including the results of the nine waves of the all-Russia monitoring project of the Russian Science Foundation, The Dynamics of the Social Transformation of Modern Russia in the Socioeconomic, Political, Sociocultural, and Ethnoreligious Contexts (2014-2018), and their comparative analysis. The social structure of modern Russian society is considered from the viewpoint of the stratification of respondents by income, the model of which divides the country's population into three basic groups. The largest of them is the median one, demonstrating the average standard of living in today's Russia. As a challenge to state socioeconomic policy, the presence of a significant stratum of low-income people is recorded, including the vulnerable and lower strata of the median population group. The dynamics of the mass ideas of Russians about the causes of poverty and wealth in postreform Russian society is analyzed. The assessment of the level and quality of life of various population groups is provided considering the indicators of objective and subjective well-being/ill-being, based on Russians' perception of current social reality. The conclusion is reached that the social results and consequences of the almost three decades of post-Soviet transformations have proved the inadequacy of the model of market reforms borrowed from the arsenal of Western theoretical thought, which is manifested, in particular, in the utmost understatement of the role of state participation in solving key socioeconomic and sociocultural problems. Hence, it is necessary to search for the answer to the question of how to improve the quality of state participation in society as a whole and in the economy in particular. It is proved that the determining factor of the inverse effect on the functioning and development of the economy is social relations; this supports the use of noneconomic, macrosocial indicators in the management process, which characterize the social condition of society in a specific historical period of its functioning and development. The analysis of social changes in Russian society is accompanied by the formulation of several postulates.

AB This article is a review of relevant scientific literature on the consequences of the growing popularity of behavioral economics in the field of public administration and public policy. The main result of behavioral research that arose in the 1970s at the intersection of psychology and economics was the discovery of irrational decision-making mechanisms and the rejection of the traditional economic concepts of human nature. Revision of the axioms of the rational choice theory in turn made possible the emergence of new public policy instruments that can influence unconscious psychological triggers, compensating for the cognitive insufficiency of the governed subjects. An active appeal to cognitive sciences, including behavioral economics, neuroscience, and research in the field of artificial intelligence, is one of the main trends in modern public administration. In many countries, the recommendations of the so-called nudge theory by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein are being introduced at the national government level. The question arises whether behavioral economics can become the new paradigm of economic policy, or whether we are witnessing the radicalization of neoliberalism, which is trying to overcome the structural economic problems with the help of new scientific discoveries. Using Michel Foucault's governmentality analytics and existing research on this topic, the author shows that conceptual changes in economic theory significantly influence the balance of power relations in society. In particular, the pressure of modern cognitive sciences on liberal notions of autonomy, as well as the expansion of the range of psychological tools used to govern the population, sharpen the question of the compatibility of the basic political categories of liberalism and the new technologies of governance. It creates the prerequisites for the formation and strengthening of quasi-authoritarian regimes of power that are able to achieve economic efficiency without appealing to active subjects and personal freedom.

AB This article is focused on several themes connected with the history of photography, political exile in Imperial Russia, exploration and representations of Siberia in the late 19th-early 20th centuries. Photography became an essential tool in numerous geographic, topographic and ethnographic expeditions to Siberia in the late 19th century; well-known scientists started to master photography or were accompanied by professional photographers in their expeditions, including ones organized by the Russian Imperial Geographic Society, which resulted in the photographic records, reports, publications and exhibitions. Photography was rapidly spreading across Asian Russia and by the end of the 19th century there was a photo studio (or several ones) in almost every Siberian town. Political exiles were often among Siberian photographers, making photography their new profession, business, a way of getting a social status in the local society, and a means of surviving financially as well as intellectually and emotionally. They contributed significantly to the museum's collections by photographing indigenous people in Siberia and even traveling to Mongolia and China, displaying "types" as a part of anthropological research in Asia and presenting "views" of the Russian empire's borderlands. The visual representation of Siberia corresponded with general perceptions of an exotic East, populated by "primitive" peoples devoid of civilization, a trope reinforced by numerous photographs and depictions of Siberia as an untamed natural world, later transformed and modernized by the railroads construction.

At the present stage of the development of cognitive science, which is designated as connectionist, consciousness is studied in the context of the neural network approach to brain modeling. The essence of the problem is whether consciousness can be understood through the study of cognitive mechanisms, such as perception, attention, memory, or whether consciousness is a specific phenomenon with its own neural substrate. One of the branches of modern cognitive science-cognitive neuroscience-develops concepts explaining the connection of the neural correlates of consciousness with its phenomenal properties. Cognitive science uses a reductionist methodology regardless of the basis (informational, biological or neural network interactions) of consciousness. Modern trends in the development of research in cognitive science, which express a new view on the nature of cognitive processes, are represented by the concept of embodied cognition, in which mind and body are inseparably connected, and enactivism. Within the enactivist approach, consciousness is embodied, and it emerges in the course of evolution, which can be understood as a cognitive activity accomplished through action into the environment. Cognitive processes are explained by such research programs as evolutionary epistemology. The latter confirms the fact that life is moving along the way of improving knowledge towards a more refined, well-ordered organization, and knowledge is regarded as the most important adaptive mechanism of evolution. Higher levels of information processing affect lower ones in this complex hierarchically organized recursive cognitive process. This is important for understanding the role of consciousness as an organizing and transformative element of the cognitive process. Cognitive science seeks and finds confirmation of the functioning of consciousness, cognition, and language in natural sciences. However, demonstrating the complexity of these processes, it only starts to take into account and to reveal issues that involve deeper dimensions: sources of creativity, paradox, mental and spiritual life of the human soul.

AB The article discusses the formation and development of the Arctic strategy of Great Britain. The author studies the scientific component in official government documents on the Arctic. London has incentives that its advanced science demonstrates to the world Britain's close research, historical, cultural, commercial and military ties with the Arctic. The production of knowledge that will have a global reach is one of the main opportunities for the British government to influence the international community. The government of the Kingdom is well aware that the changes occurring in the Arctic due to ice melting can bring economic benefits in the near future. The tempting prospects motivate the UK to remain one of the world's top leaders in supporting environmental protection and international cooperation in the region. On the one hand, Britain's science diplomacy in the Arctic is a tool of reducing tensions and strengthening cooperation with Russia in the economic, financial and political spheres. On the other hand, the scientific activity of the Kingdom in the polar region is a means to consolidate the subarctic status of the country and legitimize its presence in the polar latitudes, which in the future may allow the UK to participate in political and economic processes of the Arctic resources distribution. The joint scientific activity of Russia and Great Britain currently remains, perhaps, one of the few tools that will improve relations between the two countries in the future, establish partnership and prove that mutual cooperation can be beneficial. At the same time, it is obvious that Russia remains the main geopolitical opponent of the UK in the region. From Britain's perspective, it destabilizes the situation in the Arctic, prevents the protection and sustainable development of the region for the common good.

DE Weber; anomie; ideal type; asceticism; mysticism
AB The theoretical legacy of Max Weber has already been studied by many generations of sociologists, and every aspect of his works has been examined in detail. Despite this, in Weber's works, one can find unexplored ideas that are of great importance for sociology and contribute to the actualization of Weber's creativity. In particular, Weber considered the phenomenon of anomie and even suggested its original interpretation. This allows us to consider Weber as one of the founders of the theory of anomie along with Durkheim, Merton and Srol. Weber connected the development of anomie with the religious perception of the world by man. He singles out asceticism as an active mastery of the world and mysticism as a contemplative rejection of the world. In its extreme degree, mysticism takes the form of anomie when a person so directs their thoughts toward God that they completely disregard the norms and values that prevail in society. The anomie described by Weber is a characteristic of eastern religions such as Buddhism or Hinduism and therefore was undeservedly ignored by the anomie theorists who were interested in the anomie of the Western society. The concept of Weber's anomie is extremely interesting since it can be used in the case of reconceptualization. A person's complete orientation toward religion can be replaced by a full orientation toward other things. In the modern world, a person can be totally focused on game addiction, subculture or something like that. When analyzing the social behavior of people whose interests are not related to the interests of the surrounding society, Weber's explanatory scheme will work. Weber's anomie is described as a state in which ethical, legal and practical considerations of everyday life become indifferent to a person. In general, Weber's anomie can be defined as the absence of definitive ethical values. Anomie in this interpretation is extremely destructive as it undermines the goal-oriented action, and therefore all social behavior as such. As a result, Weber's anomie leads to the erosion of the norms of law and everyday norms of a moral behavior. The great advantage of Weber's concept of anomie is that it simultaneously affects the anomie of a person and the anomie of society. Most other concepts interpret only one aspect of this phenomenon. Comprehension and reconceptualization of Weber's anomie theory can give stimulus to the development of criminology and the sociology of deviant behavior, the creation on their basis of programs of practical activities for the prevention of crime and deviation.

DE spirituality; spiritual search; spiritual center; religious experience
AB The problem of the article is the identification, description and analysis of modern Russian women's spiritual experience, methods of its living, and sensations. The author considers spiritual search as a manifestation of spirituality. The possibilities of revealing the features of spiritual experience, including in contrast to the religious one, are evaluated. To study the problem, a qualitative methodology was used (in-depth interviews were conducted with women with experience in spiritual search, living in large cities of Russia). Interpretation of semantic constructions is revealed within the framework of coding (according to the methodology of the "grounded theory" by Anselm Strauss and Juliet Corbin). As a result, the nature of states and situations, which are the starting point of a spiritual search, is revealed. This nature is described as life impulses, desires, internal state, social framework, life situation. To overcome a situation, condition or to satisfy an emerging desire, to restrain the impulse, women begin "spiritual" search. In the course of their spiritual search, women use active and interactive, individual and group search tools. The informants describe the process of spiritual search through a number of specific categories, and, in this, the spiritual aspect of the search manifests itself. In the course of a spiritual search, gaining spiritual experience, informants fix certain sensations: a significant part of the sensations is associated with the sensation of the process and the efforts that have to be made; part of the sensations is associated with discoveries or revelations, insights to which a woman comes. The informants are sure that the acquired knowledge is their personal revelation, contact with the supernatural. The difficulties of using the term "spirituality" in the Russian scientific discourse connected with its association with certain cultural codes and conditions are also indicated. The difficulties of finding a theoretical framework for the study of spiritual experience in the sciences on religion, the difficulties of distinguishing between spiritual and religious experience are shown. The women revealed the presence of an implicit attitude to spirituality, manifested in women's willingness to participate in spiritual practices, to immerse themselves in spiritual search, to share ideas close to non-institutional religiosity, spirituality. The informants clearly articulated their position regarding religion, designating spiritual practices in which they participate as non-religious. The results can be used in subsequent qualitative studies of spirituality in Russia and in the preparation of quantitative empirical studies.

TI The Folk "Myth of the Tsar": A Cultural Transfer From a "Caesar" to the
   "Venetian Imposture" of Yemelyan Pugachev
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE cultural transfer; Caesar; tsar; sacralization; "myth of the Tsar";
   impostors; Pugachev; "Venetian impostor"
AB The article explores the features of "cultural transfer" as a methodology of scientific research. It is shown that the cognitive concept "cultural transfer" appeared in the 1980s in the works of Michel Espagne and Michael Werner. Later, due to its effectiveness, it became widespread in the humanities, including historical science. The article attempts to identify and test the epistemological possibilities of "cultural transfer" to study some important aspects of the Russian historical past. For this purpose, various links of evolution of the Latin concept "Caesar" in the domestic political tradition are considered. It is shown that in ancient times this concept was borrowed by the Roman neighbours as a designation of the supreme ruler. Later it entered our lexicon and was transformed through the Russian "Caesar" into the actual "Tsar". In the Russian political tradition, primarily in the Moscow period, through numerous forms of representation, this title was sacralized: the Tsar is the anointed of God on earth; God is the Tsar of heaven, the Tsar is the God of the earth. Reinterpreted by folk culture within the framework of the antithesis of true and false tsars, the cult of the monarch formed a stable folk "myth of the Tsar". Against the background of the crisis of legitimacy of the authorities of the early 17th century and later, the myth gave rise to a string of impostors of a monarchical type; their total number in the 17th18th centuries reached almost one and a half hundred. Among the impostors, one of the most famous and successful was Yemelyan Pugachev. Under the name of Peter III, he headed the people's revolt, largest in Russian history. The colourful figure of the self-proclaimed "third Emperor", who raised and united many thousands of underclass people around him, aroused the enduring interest of Europeans and, in turn, became the object of mythologization. One of its bright fruits in European literature was the case of the "Venetian impostor" Pugachev. Made famous by the book False Peter III in French, this case had an impact on the Russian literature of the early 19th century. In 1809 a Russian translation of this book and a short extract in the form of Anecdotes about the Rebel and Impostor Emelka Pugachev were published in Moscow. It is concluded that the methodology of "cultural transfer" allows a better understanding of the features of the Russian political tradition. In particular, it provides an opportunity to successfully identify and analyse the features of the national "myth of the Tsar", widespread in the real historical past and in the literary process of our country.

AB In the book Metaphors We Live By, published in 1980, George Lakoff and Mark Johnson presented a view on the phenomenon of metaphor unique for that time. They suggested that metaphor is a basic category of human thinking, thus noticeably increasing the theoretical significance of metaphor for researchers engaged in linguistic-cognitive problems. With the theory of cognitive metaphor, which also implicitly contains a method for analyzing information obtained by studying metaphors, the authors proposed their theory of truth, which they called experientialist. Lakoff and Johnson considered the provisions of this theory as the basis for the analysis of metaphors of natural language. And, despite the interest shown by many researchers in the methodological and conceptual components of the cognitive theory of metaphor, its ontological and epistemological foundations (experientialist theory of truth) remain practically unreflected. In this article, the author analyzes the content of the experientialist theory of truth, which was supposed to fix the status of full-fledged participants in the cognitive process for metaphors. Having studied in detail the specifics of the experientialist theory of truth, the author concluded that this theory is an example of classical epistemological relativism and does not bring anything new to this direction. Besides, it has several disadvantages that negatively distinguish it from analogs. Examples of such shortcomings are internal inconsistency, the use of specific concepts without clarifying their meanings, "fitting" the meaning of terms to the needs of the developed theory. Given all of the above, the author concluded that the followers of the cognitive theory of metaphor should abandon the ontological and epistemological foundations developed by its authors (experientialist theory of truth) and include the metaphor analysis methodology they created into a more consistent and conceptually strong epistemological paradigm.

AB The article considers the phenomenon of political populism, which is complex and multifaceted. Despite more than fifty years of interest in this issue, political science has still not developed a unified concept and common understanding of populism. In this regard, in the framework of this study, the aim was set to analyze the evolution of approaches to understanding populism, highlight their specific features, and also note their current state. This seems very important and relevant in the context of the "victorious advance" of populist practices and ideas around the world: from the "new" European right and left parties to Donald Trump and Rodrigo Duterte. At the same time, in Russian realities, this phenomenon has practical consequences, expressed in the increase of political activity and protest moods among young people, which is associated with the dominance of populist practices in virtual space in general, and in social networks in particular. The study is based on the works of prominent foreign researchers of political populism, who proposed their own vision of this phenomenon and had a significant influence on their followers: the Argentine and Spanish post-Marxist political scientist E. Laclau (formal-discursive approach), the British political scientist M. Canovan (structural approach), the Dutch and American political scientist C. Mudde (ideological approach). Based on the methods of comparative and diachronic analysis, the author identifies the advantages and disadvantages of the concepts under consideration. At the same time, special attention is paid to the modern manifestations of populism and their theoretical explanations by researchers, which led to the emergence of the concepts "digital populism", "populism 2.0" (similar to Web 2.0). In the course of the research, the author made several important conclusions. The conceptual vagueness of the notion of political populism originates at the first conference (at the London School of Economics) and continues to the present. The explanation of this fact is both the various theoretical foundations that the researchers resorted to, and the attempt to explain the heterogeneous manifestations of the phenomenon under consideration using one model without taking into account historical, political and socio-economic contexts. At the same time, the author notes that nowadays an understanding of the close relationship between populism and the phenomena of post-truth, post-politics and post-democracy has emerged, which, coupled with the growing influence of new information and communication channels, allows us to speak of a "new populism". Developing this idea, the author comes to the conclusion that populism itself should be perceived as a twofold product of the postmodern era, combining advanced digital practices with archaic elements; as a tool to achieve political goals based on the polarization and radicalization of positions and ideas, simplification of politics and political problems, as well as appeal to emotional empathy and irritation.

AB The article deals with the transformation of the social subject of modernity in conjunction with macrosocial processes leading to qualitative theoretical and methodological changes in the paradigm of the subject within the social and philosophical discourse. The authors identify fourteen dimensions in which qualitative features of modern society are determined: globalism; quali-liberalism, quasi-democracy; manufacturing consent; individualization; risk; postmodernity; technocracy, postindustrialism; information; neoliberalism; post-capitalism; consumerism; mass society; network society; control society. In the projection on the social subject, specific transformations are identified that determine it in the modern world, among which the authors highlight the following: flexibility as an integral property of dynamism and flexibility of behavior; openness, resonance, intuition; ultra-rationality as the ability to combine logic with intuition in the analysis of transforming systems; transversality as an ability to sharpen dialogue beyond disciplinary discourses. As the next step, the authors correlate the resulting transformations with the general theoretical and methodological discourse with the general paradigm of the subject in social philosophy. The issues raised are topical in the applied fields of sociohumanitarian knowledge since the answers to these questions set the guidelines for designing the trajectory of a social subject in the modern world and fill the process of their socialization with concrete content.

DE neuroetics; freewill; naturalism in ethics; philosophy of law
AB The aim of the article is to establish a relation between philosophical programs and solutions to problems that are discussed in neuroethics. This kind of relation illustrates neuroscience as a technoscience characterized by a strong connection between fundamental and applied levels. Neuroethics is considered as the space for the actualization of philosophical programs in the philosophy of mind, moral philosophy, and the philosophy of law. The impulse from modern neuroscience makes us revise the conceptual baggage of philosophical programs, to fill it with new content. The confrontation of traditional philosophical approaches to the problem of human mind and the whole sphere of the ideal enters a completely different stage, in the context of new data of brain activity. New aspects are opening up in the discussion of compatibilists and incompatibilists about free will. For instance, arguments from philosophical discussions are relevant for neuroethics in discussing the problem of preserving personal identity, using various stimulations of brain activity. Another example is the dispute over responsibility for the acts committed. Representatives of hard incompatibility (Derek Pereboom) believe that modern neuroscience research has debunked the beliefs in the existence of free will; therefore, the concept of responsibility should be revised. The opposition of legal positivism and natural law acquires a new meaning in the philosophy of law, which is important for neuroethics since the distinction between rights and law will determine its regulatory capabilities. Neuroethics may be understood not just as a kind of bioethics with its neurotechnology dilemmas. The status of neuroethics is discussed when it refers to neuroscience ethics, which explains moral phenomena for neurophysiological reasons. Discussions between naturalistic and sociocultural explanations of morality again return to philosophy. Thus, the opposition to philosophical programs creates an important potential for understanding neuroethics itself.

TI ABOUT THE SCIENCE OF PEDAGOGY (HOW TO AVOID THE TRANSFORMATION OF
   PEDAGOGICAL SCIENCE INTO IDEOLOGY)
SO OBRAZOVANIE I NAUKA-EDUCATION AND SCIENCE
LA Russian
DT Article
DE history of pedagogy; reform of the academies of sciences; ideology;
   education
AB Introduction. Numerous declarative official statements on the key role of education and scientific-pedagogical knowledge to ensure the well-being of the nation and the sustainable development of Russia in the modern world directly contradict the situation in this strategically significant social area. Thus, when merging two specialised academies (medical and agricultural sciences) with alma mater - the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS), the Russian Academy of Education (RAE) was not included in the list of the elected representatives, which may indirectly demonstrate the "inferiority" of scientific pedagogy, calling into question its mission in the development of education.
   The aim of the article is to discuss the conditions and prerequisites for the possible loss of scientific status by pedagogy, its transformation into ideology and the replacement of pedagogical principles of education development by ideological ones.
   Methodology and research methods. In the course of the research, the methods of the system-based, retrospective and comparative analysis, synthesis and generalisation were employed.
   Results and scientific novelty. The author of the present publication considers and analyses the origins of scientific pedagogy and its essential definitions in the works of classical scholars - K. D. Ushinsky, L. N. Tolstoy, P. F. Kapterev, V. P. Vakhterov, K. N. Ventzel, etc. with contemporary interpretation of scientific status of pedagogical branch of knowledge. The paper highlights the impact on its reorganisation, content transformations of political and social processes, as well as transformations of governmental management structures. It has been proved that the reforms of the Russian science carried out in recent years consistently lead to the loss of scientific status by pedagogy, to the loss of academic principle "science should be managed by scientists" and to the transformation of scientific institutions into subordinate structures. Contrary to the Article 13 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation, which states that "no ideology may be established as state or mandatory", there is a conversion of pedagogy into ideology. The classical pedagogical foundations evolutionary development inherent in scientific knowledge are deformed by current ideological attitudes, nullifying the constitutional guarantee (Article 44) on freedom of literary, artistic, scientific, technical and other forms of creativity. The depoliticisation of educational sphere and pedagogical science was planned at the end of the 20th century but it was abandoned. Therefore, the author emphasises the importance of such process.
   Practical significance. The assessments and conclusions presented in the article create methodological prerequisites for developing a discussion about the mission of pedagogical science in modern Russian society, adjusting scientific reforms and, as a result, freeing education from ideological violence.

AB Self-organization plays a significant role in society. The streamlining and reformatting of social connections and interactions, the disintegration and birth of new sociocultural models, the forming of intragroup and intergroup solidarities are associated with self-organization. Young people as a relatively independent socio-demographic group have a high potential for self-organization. Its focus is determined by the motivational factors underlying it. While some strategies achieve an optimal result, others lead to an escalation of contradictions, becoming a social problem. While some strategies achieve an optimal result, others lead to an escalation of contradictions becoming a social problem. The problem comes to be significantly exacerbated in the conditions of social uncertainty and crises when spontaneous decisions in the field of management start to conflict with the images of reality and the well-established semantic structures of individuals and groups, not only failing to achieve the goal, but also provoking cultural conflicts. All this puts forward an analysis of the bases of youth self-organization into a line of priority research tasks and determines the relevance of their study in the context of a more general mechanism of social self-regulation of life activity. The Center for Sociology of Youth, Institute of Socio-Political Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences, is developing a sociocultural mechanism of self-regulation of youth activity to study the processes of self-organization and their motivating sources. This article presents the results of the structural taxonomy used to analyze the motives of self-organization in the youth environment. The interrelation of elements of the self-regulation mechanism with representatives of youth self-organization is analyzed. On the basis of a taxonomic analysis, zones of attraction of archetypical and mental features, life-long (sense-of-life) values and self-organization attitudes of young people are revealed.

DT Article
DE bailiff offices; private bailiff; Chief bailiff; North Caucasus; Russian
   Empire; administrative structure; periodization
AB The article considers the evolution and suggests the periodization of the activities of local judicial and administrative control institutions in the North Caucasus in the last third of the 18th - first half of the 19th centuries on the example of bailiffs' offices. Four stages are highlighted: 1) the establishment of the first private bailiff in Kabarda (1769) and the formation of the Main Caucasian bailiff's office (1800); 2) its separation from the Main Kalmyk bailiff's office structure (1801); 3) adoption of an Institution for the administration of the Caucasus region (1827); 4) reorganization of the Chechen bailiff (1852) and replacement of bailiffs by institutions of military popular administration (1858). The functions of the main and local bailiffs' offices within the framework of the proposed periodization are considered. The features of administrative subordination of local and main bailiff offices and their staff structure are studied. Attention is drawn to the difficulties of organizing the activities of bailiffs' offices related to their subordination, on the one hand, to the Board (Ministry) of Foreign Affairs, on the other - to the provincial or linear authorities. It is concluded that the proposed periodization allows to present the dynamics of the activity of the bailiffs in the North Caucasus in the last third of the 18th - first half of the 19th centuries as a complex phenomenon aimed at finding optimal forms of governance of the peoples included in the political and legal space of the Russian Empire.

The main content of the research is an analysis of the work "Legal state and socialism", its structure and features. The main message of Hessen's work is characterized by a crisis of liberalism, which was simultaneously a crisis of communism. The article deals in detail with the question of Hesse's attitude to liberalism and communism and the formation of its own related concept of the rule of law and law as its instrument. The conclusion is made that Hessen's criticism is extremely fruitful in the history of socio-political thought.

DT Article
DE political everyday life; autocracy; Slavophilism; absolutism; political
   system; political history
AB This article discusses one of the main issues in K A. Solovyov's 2018 monograph on the political system of the Russian Empire from Emperor Alexander III until the reforms of 1905-1906. Solovyov, a chief research fellow of the Institute of Russian History of the Russian Academy of Sciences, states that the regime in this period should be studied from the point of view of "the political everyday life". This would help scholars develop a "new political history" and reconstruct the past in away closer to historical reality than is done at present. This approach has met criticism. Despite a number of successful examples of the use of Solovyov's optics of "political everyday life," it is not sufficiently comprehensive or robust for understanding the phenomenology of the late autocracy, because it does not take into account the most important features of this regime: the status of the monarch and the nature of his power. Those phenomena cannot be understood in the context of exclusively administrative practices. To support this claim, the author analyzes both the concepts of political thinkers Solovyov studied and did not mention. The author suggests that the prism of "everyday life" cannot provide a correct interpretation of events.

ID CHOICE; INNOVATION
AB The institutions improvement is one of principal conditions for the transitional and developing economies growth. This study on the bases of multidisciplinary approach investigates the necessity of using the concept "institutional uncertainty" in economic and social researching, proves that the institutional uncertainty exists as a result of imperfect knowledge of economic agents rooting in economic agents' mentality. The institutional uncertainty is an obligatory attribute of institutional environment, because institutions have capability to generate not only "certainty" but also "uncertainty" and "risks" for economic agents. The institutional uncertainty as Knightian uncertainty reflect the unpredictability of changes of institutional environment and basic institutions (ethic, ethnic, cultural, ideology, political, business and so on), and the unpredictability of it influences on economic agents' behavior. In this connection it needs to specify the institutional uncertainty from political risks and political uncertainty. Leading reasons of the institutional uncertainty are presented on the micro-level at performance of different types of incomplete contracts widespread in market and in pre-market economies. On the macro-level the concept of institutional uncertainty is reflecting not only unpredictability of institutional changes, but also uniqueness of combinations of driving forces of transition to new frames of economy and society. Some directions of using this concept at investigation of historic institutional changes and institutional changes in modern transitional and developing economies are considered in the last parts of the study.

AB The article discusses the possibility of expanding the formats of control over nuclear weapons in a situation where China opposes the invitation of the United States to join the talks on medium-range missiles, the extension of the START-3 and the next strategic agreement. The economic, political and military importance of Asia-Pacific region is growing rapidly. The relationship between the forces and interests of Russia, China and the United States in this region is analyzed. Particular attention is paid to the nuclear balance of forces in the region - weapons, their development programs and strategic concepts of use, as well as the agenda of US-Chinese and Russian-American relations. According to the author, in a favorable political environment, it is possible to create a trilateral format for arms control in the form of an integrated New START / INF treaty with the participation of Russia, the United States and China. Such a format would provide China with equal strategic status with the two superpowers and their recognition (even by default) of China's right to parity and stable mutual deterrence. While Russia and the United States, in addition to resolving a number of bilateral stability issues, would receive guarantees of predictability and the limits of building up Chinese strategic and medium-range nuclear and conventional weapons. At the same time, the author emphasizes the need to continue the bilateral negotiation process as the basis for the transition to multilateral arms control.

AB The article draws on documents from the United State Archive of the Chelyabinsk Region to examine biographies of Chinese migrants repressed in 1937-38. Although main location of the Chinese in the Urals in the 1920-1930s was the Middle Urals (Perm and Sverdlovsk), their presence has been traced in the Chelyabinsk region. Comprehensive reconstruction of Chinese migration in the USSR demands introduction of these sources to scientific use. The 1930s archival documents, primarily the investigative files of the repressed, demonstrate socio-demographic features of the Chinese and show their most typical biographies in the pre-war USSR. They were mostly of the Soviet era wave of migration, originating from the Shandong province. Some adapted well in society, married Russian women and had children. However, many remained illiterate, engaged in heavy physical labor. Qualitative analysis of personal files shows main trajectories of Chinese migration to the South Urals from the Far East or from large cities (Moscow, Irkutsk, Khabarovsk, etc.), where Chinese communities appeared in the 1920s. State pressure on the Chinese community strengthened in the late 1920s - early 1930s, forcing them to change their place of residence. Political changes in the USSR made the Chinese abandon their private enterprises and trade, their main niche in the 1920s. In 1937-38, a wave of repression rolled and, according to our estimates, almost half of the Chinese in the Chelyabinsk region were declared "spies and agents of Japanese intelligence." The biographies of the repressed testify that under favorable conditions they could have contributed to creation of an organized Chinese community, since they had influence over Chinese migrants, as well as experience of organizational work and of participating in the Civil War.

AB This article addresses the issue of support for civil society organizations in an authoritarian regime. Autocracies and civic associations are traditionally viewed as antagonists as the former frequently suppress the activity of the latter. However, recent research demonstrates that these relationships are more complex, and that autocracies can use such institutions to legitimize and strengthen their political resilience: autocracies use NGOs as feedback mechanisms, for monitoring problem situations, monitoring mobilization, and divide the non-profit sector into loyal and disloyal. Using data on the distribution of the "presidential grants" among human rights NGOs in Russia in 2017-2018 and data on the inclusion of the representatives of these organizations in state-sponsored institutions (consultative bodies, the All-Russian People's Front, and parliamentary parties), we analyze the relationship between these two indicators and find evidence for political bias in providing financial help. In particular, we find that affiliation with the All-Russian People's Front (a Kremlin initiative) and systemic opposition both positively affect the likelihood of obtaining a larger grant. Affiliation with the ruling party is not a factor in this regard. We conclude that the promotion of the political loyalty of NGOs via the redistribution of state financial help is a more subtle mechanism than might seem at first glance.

AB Regarding the balance between political control over civic associations and their social effectiveness (in using the functions of supporting the population and providing social services in undemocratic political regimes), this article aims to summarize and systematize the scientific literature and scientific discussion of this problem. The key theoretical and methodological directions and problems of civil society research in autocracies are considered. It is noted that empirical studies have accumulated considerable material analysing the specific mechanisms authoritarian regimes use to influence civil associations with a view to maintaining political control and ensuring social functions (cooptation, organizational and legal control, organizational and political control, quasi-non-governmental organizations), as well as into why civil associations are involved in supporting an authoritarian political order (access to limited resources, access to bureaucratic infrastructure, the possibility of consulting the authorities, the possibility of the manifestation of the rights of the target group). Studies on materials of Mozambique, Algeria, Ethiopia, Syria, Turkey, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Russia, Jordan, Malaysia, Vietnam, China, etc, mainly carried out over the last 10 years, are analyzed. The problem that, in spite of considerable empirical material, non-democracies have not yet formulated a stable explanatory model or middle-level theory that would become conventional for these studies is discussed. Detailed consideration is given to how scientific literature answers the questions: why do authoritarian regimes need independent civil associations that can become triggers for democratization and/or political reforms; and for what reasons do independent associations participate in supporting authoritarian stability, despite the fact that the regime seeks to limiting independent civil activity? In conclusion, ideas are advanced on promising directions both in the theoretical-methodological and empirical development of studies of the dynamics of relations between authoritarian regimes and civil society institutions.

AB Today youth problems and, in broader terms, generation problems, succession of generations, sharing experience and acquiring new values, learning new social practices, are among the most important things required to keep the integrity of the society as a system and its development dynamics. There are some worrying trends characterizing the change of the youth place in the Russian society. Since the beginning of the XXI century, the number of young people aged 15-29 has decreased in Russia by almost 10 million people, or 7% in the country's population. This determines in the future an alarming level of demographic burden. Such quantitative proportions make us look forward with ever growing concerns. We will, among other things, have to carefully analyze the current situation of the youth in Russia. The article is focused on three most pressing blocks of problems and challenges faced by the modern youth. First, these are the challenges of social stratification and social mobility of the youth, which builds a new hierarchical youth pyramid. Second, the youth situation and behavior in the labor market resulting from its conflicting changes and the new forms of employment. Third, changes in values, models of the sociocultural behavior, which are not the same for all the young people. The major case of such changes is the political socialization of the modern youth.

AB Luc Boltanski visited Russia in September, 2019, to support the publication of the Russian translation of his book Mysteries and Conspiracies: Detective Stories, Spy Novels and the Making of Modern Societies. It was his second visit to Russia, where he delivered three lectures. The first lecture was dedicated to Mysteries and Conspiracies. The second lecture was dedicated to his last book Enrichment: A Critique of Commodities, which he wrote with Arnaud Esquerre. The third lecture focused on the relationship between the critical sociology of the Pierre Bourdieu school, and the pragmatic sociology of critical capacity promoted by Luc Boltanski together with his long-time collaborator, Laurent Thevenot, within their Group of Political and Moral Sociology. In this review of the two different approaches, he revisited the theme of his 2009 book On Critique: A Sociology of Emancipation which proclaimed the then-new theoretical synthesis. Mysteries and Conspiracies, published three years later, became the first demonstration of the practical implementation of this new model. On September 14, 2019, Luc Boltanski had an extensive talk with Oleg Kharkhordin wherein he clarified some issues of these lectures. The first part of this interview which was devoted to Mysteries and Conspiracies was published by the Russian on-line edition of gorky media. Here, we publish the second part of this long interview covering the late writings of the famous French sociologist, the issues explored by his book On Critique, and the beginnings of his academic career when he was an active participant of the Pierre Bourdieu school.

AB The article substantiates the possibility of interpreting expertise as a research communicative practice, in contrast to the expert "comparison with the sample". Inside the so-called examinations, a counter-examination is institutionally integrated. The communication of expert and counter-expert position, which is a phenomenological personality choice, can take a form of personal institutionalized communication, and can be mediated by mediators and media texts. The results of examination and counter-interaction are determined by many factors, among which the coincidence (mismatch) of the images of the future. Communication between a layman and an expert about science-dimensional situations can be considered in prism of various optics - linguistic, sociological, socio-political, psychological optics, fixing a number of several paradoxes (equality, limited choice, excess / deficit).

TI BACK TO THE SUBJECT: THE THEORY OF JUST WAR IN CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL
   THOUGHT
SO POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE war; legitimacy; sovereignty; human rights; ideology; J. Habermas; M.
   Waltzer; K. Schmitt; V. Lenin
AB The article compares several intellectual paradigms that inform the problem of just war. The beginning of article shows that the present-day legalist theory of permissible war (like Conventions and Charters of the UN), to our mind, inherits an antinomy which emerged in the history of political thought, and which counterposes state sovereignty and human rights. Within such normative framework, the justification of war gravitates either to protection of state sovereignty or to the defense of human rights; for example, the priority of human rights over sovereignty is being proclaimed by authors such as Habermas, who reduce war to a mere 'police operation'. We reconstruct the philosophical foundations of this theory (Vattel, Kant) to suggest that such a normative theory incurs the loss of state legitimacy as a criterion jus ad bellum, interpreting legitimacy on contractual terms. Further, we examine ideas of political realism (Morgenthau) and the critics of 'Kantian-Wilsonian system', which, as certain authors consider (Schmitt), leads towards the demonization of an enemy, towards the endless escalation of violence, and towards the transformation of regular war into partisan war. The third part of the article deals with the legitimation of war in Bolshevik political philosophy and studies the specifics of arguments of Lenin, which, along with the works of Pashukanis, represent the nucleus of the unique concept of just war, which goes beyond the antinomy 'sovereignty - rights'. In the final chapter, the authors show that Walzer's theory of just war, which is popular nowadays, shares certain characteristics with Leninist theory of war; for both these theories, firstly, both place importance in rhetoric strategies for problematizing the status of subjects waging war; secondly, both are sensitive to status-based justifications of war in particular cases; and thirdly, both place emphasis upon the necessity of effective persuasion of 'ordinary people' (or 'masses', in Lenin's words) in the just character of war. The authors conclude that it is attention to the subject waging war and the subject consuming the information (an "ordinary person") that makes a difference between these theories from the 'Kantian-Wilsonain system', from the strict legalist paradigm, and, finally, from the political realism of Morgenthau and Schmitt which operates through the concept of depersonalized state interest.

Fifty years ago, in 1969, the first STS academic program was opened at Cornell University. STS sees its main objectives as a study of the relationship between science, technology and society. STS also explores the social, political, economic, cultural and historical aspects of the development of modern science and technology. This paper will provide an analysis of the field of STS. Its task is to demarcate the field's boundaries and clarify which stories, events around scientific and technological development and the ways of understanding them are suggested here. Without pretending to a full analysis, this paper will consider the background, the origins, the main direction that STS have offered social sciences during 50 years of its activities.

ID TRANSLATIONS
AB The article presents an attempt to describe the intellectual context in which cameralism developed in the 18th century. The main thesis is that during this period two independent sources of economic thought were formed: one goes back to scholasticism and developed in the frame of jurisprudence and moral philosophy; the other one takes its origins in the "science of public administration", which is distinguished by practical goals it set and the absence of a theoretical system. During our investigation, we made a focus on the tradition of natural law and its evolution (the scholastic, rationalist (J. Locke and others) and sociological (D. Hume and others) schools are compared). The comparison of thoughts is carried out by three points, which were essential for the development of economic thought of this period: 1) methodological (apriorism/anti-apriorism); 2) anthropological (acceptance/improvement of the natural properties of man); 3) political (liberalism/ regulationism in economics). The study draws parallels with the development of economic thought in Russia in the 18th century.

DE Japanese military intervention; Siberia and the Far East; historiography
   of Russo-Japanese relations; modern history problems
AB This paper is devoted to the problems of studying and perception of the Japanese military intervention in the Far East and Siberia regions during the Russian Civil War in modern historical literature. The work discusses the relationship of the development of historiography of Russo-Japanese relations with public perceptions and targeted propaganda by political elites and authorities. Due to the peculiarities of Russia's geopolitical position, all the problems of international relations in the Far East region were considered through the lens of the country's territorial integrity. During the Civil War, the Bolsheviks successfully used anti-Japanese phobias to fight political opponents. The political propaganda attitudes formed in the Civil War and subsequent events of the Soviet-Japanese confrontation in the 1930s were transferred to the works on the history of Japanese military intervention. During the Soviet period, rather than studying the events and problems, historians focused on interpreting the official statements and the positions of the party and Soviet leaders. This trend is generally preserved in the post-Soviet historical studies too. The paper details the works of Russian historians and Japanese scholars over the past three years. A number of interesting studies are noted, for example, the works by the Japanese studies scholar K.O. Sarkisov, historians A.G. Teplyakov, F.A. Popov and others. In general, due to the lack of public demand and the inaccessibility of the documents, Russian historians do not tackle the topic even despite there being the occasion of the centenary of the events. The current level of studies of the history of Japanese military intervention in Russia remains at the level reached back in the 1930s. This situation reflects both the problems of Russian historical science and the current situation in Russo-Japanese relations.

AB This article is dedicated to the replication policy of leading world journals on international relations. The opportunity to replicate (reproduce) research results presented in foreign periodicals is viewed as an important factor of publication ethics. The experience of leading world journals and the US research infrastructure in the sphere of international relations are analyzed. The special role of the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research is shown, as well as that of the rising alternative Dataverse project, which is being developed by the Harvard Institute for Quantitative Social Science. A cross-cultural analysis of the use of research data in the leading countries of Europe and the world has been carried out. The recent efforts of Chinese universities to develop a scientific infrastructure are highlighted. The conclusion is formulated that Russia needs to create an integrated research infrastructure to generate and use databases in international political science.

AB The article examines how to apply moral and philosophical reflection in the commission of a crime. An action is the result of solving an equation with many variables. This is overcoming legal, moral, philosophical, and emotional contradictions. However, modern legal and ethical thought closes the way for understanding its causes and motives. As an example, we examine the conspiracy and murder of Caesar in Rome in 44 BC. The article reveals objective differences in the understanding of morality in antiquity and in modern ethical science. Here we analyze the philosophical and ethical grounds that will help solve this dilemma. First of all, we considered the philosophical and political works and letters of Cicero. His reasoning about the duties of a citizen might have influenced Brutus' decision to participate in the conspiracy against Caesar and accept the moral choice as his fate. Brutus did not act as a murderer, but as an exponent of public purpose and public utility, for whom the purpose of the act was the public good, incompatible with tyranny.

AB Introduction. In the age of digitalization of the public space of communication, social media acts as a new channel of interaction between power and society. On the one hand, electronic forms of public communication formulate a political course and influence the political behavior of the electorate, and on the other hand, replace mass communication by a network. Twitter's technological capabilities, being an electronic form of public communication, are addressed by representatives of the political elite in the USA. Methods and materials. The work uses network and communicative approaches, methods of situational analysis. The author addresses statistics and Twitter accounts of American politicians. Analysis. As a result of the computerization and the global spread of the Internet, social media has become an integral part of modern politics. The social network Twitter acts as a new communicative practice in the system of public administration of the USA. For President D. Trump, Twitter is an effective source and platform for presenting his position on domestic and foreign policy issues. Results. Twitter, being an interactive Internet platform based on the principles of network communication, is part of Twitter diplomacy implemented in the United States. The politicization of Twitter in the United States is targeted and ensures the interaction of the highest authorities and the electorate. Twitters functionality is used in modern American politics to shape the image characteristics of individual politicians and the country as a whole.

DT Article
DE sociopolitical tension; Russian society; social justice; conflict
   resolution audit; youth in Tatarstan
AB This article explores the level of socio-political tension in Tatarstan. The object of the study is the youth social group as a bearer of social activism. The investigation methodology is based on conflict audit technology. Technology involves the use of markers to assess sociopolitical tensions. The main evaluation marker identified a request for social justice. The distinctive characteristics of youth groups are the discretion of group affiliation, the lack of formed ideological attitudes and the latent nature of the formation of the general ideology of various youth communities. The political activism of the Russian youth does not have a pronounced ideological character and is not a decisive factor in the formation of socio-political tensions. It is concluded that the interest in the study of young people who as a group lack common ideological positions is scientifically relevant, even within radicalized communities and with comparative political identities. Consequently, the presence of stable ideological positions will contribute, in principle, to the launching of internal integration processes in these communities and to a stable organization of their discourses and struggles.

DT Article
DE collective memory; trauma to collective memory; politics of memory;
   dichotomy of "own/alien"; Central Asia
AB The article is devoted to the inclusion of the politics of memory in a wider range of national security problems, which is determined by the phenomenon of securitization. The author raises the question of the methodological limitations of the research of collective memory; in addition, the article emphasizes the difficulty of transferring the categorial apparatus of research in the characteristics of individual memory into the corresponding area of research of collective memory. The relevance of using such a category as a "collective memory trauma" is noted, and the idea that "collective memory trauma" can be understood as various manifestations of the processes of constituting a new space in the context of the "own or alien" dichotomy is shown. Based on modern research, the author emphasizes that the position of the post-Soviet space of Central Asia is of particular interest in this context. Thanks to the historical-philosophical and political science perspective, it is possible to consider it in the form of a large-scale space of identity crises, formed as a result of multilayer injuries of collective memory and attempts to work with them both from the Central Asian national states and other countries. The author of this article also fixes the complexity of working with the theme of collective memory in the context of national and supranational narratives of Central Asian states.

DT Article
DE Arctic; United Kingdom; British Arctic strategy; Northern Europe; NATO;
   EU
AB The Arctic now is not only a platform for international cooperation, but also a territory of competition between Arctic states and extra-regional players who demonstrate growing interest towards the Arctic. The United Kingdom, before the EU membership referendum, in 2016 and afterwards, has pursued a number of geopolitical, military, energy objectives in the Arctic. Since 2008, the Arctic gradually has been assuming importance for the British foreign policy. In 2013, the United Kingdom formulated its Arctic ambitions, calling itself "an Arctic state". Cooperation with the Nordic countries in a variety of formats has become the main tool of British foreign policy to promote its Arctic agenda and fulfill its objectives in the region. The purpose of the article is to provide insight into the nature and causes of the United Kingdom's interest in the Arctic, as well as its objectives there. The awareness about Britain's strategy towards the Arctic will help to understand the positions of a wide range of non-Arctic players, which form multiple bilateral and multilateral relations with all Arctic as well as non-Arctic states interested in the development of the region. As a result of the study, the authors came to the following conclusions: 1) the United Kingdom is interested in a permanent presence in the Arctic, since this region is perceived by the country's political establishment as a new resource base and as a strategic region where the UK can contribute into the development enhancing its international role according to the Global Britain strategy; 2) in light of Brexit, the position of Great Britain in the Arctic has weakened; 3) the UK needs to cooperate with all the actors who can potentially strengthen London's position in the Arctic; 4) Moscow will inevitably face opposition from the UK, which continues to promote the idea of the "Russian threat", including in the Arctic region.

AB In the circumstances of growing international tensions, changes in interrelations between Russia and different European states, it is of urgent demand to study concrete strategies that are connected with defence and security of leading European states. These strategies present the following information: self-positioning of a state in the world, defining of key partners, dangers, risks, resources to develop military sphere and ideology of foreign policy activities. The European Union is still one of the most important economic partners of Russia, at the same time our partnership is limited by mutual. Besides that, we witness growth of anti-Russian declarations and actions. This situation makes us develop analysis of interstate relations considering such criteria as military and political resources, coalitions, positioning of a state. Here, of particular importance is the understanding of the national interests of the states, both in the broad context of international relations and in relation to Russia. In addition, it is the analysis of strategic documents that makes it possible to correctly solve the security dilemma by analyzing the choice made by the state between rivalry and cooperation.
   Taking into account the traditional historical experience and current events, it can be said that the positions of France and Great Britain lined up the construction of Europe. It is no coincidence that now it is France, and not Germany, which is proposing military-strategic initiatives for the European Union. And the UK is still conducting a selection of initiatives, seeking to preserve the status of a state that ensures European security. It is especially interesting to compare the strategies of these states in the context of Brexit.
   In the article, the authors compare documents in the field of security and defense of Great Britain and France, specifically: the tasks, tools and "image of the world" that are advanced in the military-political doctrines and strategies of the countries. These data are necessary for understanding the development of Europe as a whole in the field of security and defense, the directions of projecting the positions indicated in the doctrines on interaction with Russia and other key international players.

AB The article outlines the biographies of Russian women scientists: M. P. Sadovnikova-Koltsova, R. I. Serebrovskaya, E. I. Barulina-Vavilova, and E. N. Sakharova-Vavilova. Apart from conducting research, these women were the wives of the founders of Russian genetics, N. K. Koltsov, A. S. Serebrovsky, and N. I. Vavilov. Our study's main objective was to reconstruct the scientific biographies of these women. Using the biographical approach allowed to identify features common to these "scientific ladies" and create a kind of socio-cultural portrait of the wives of outstanding researchers. The proposed biographies of the women who witnessed transformations in Russia's political and social life in the early twentieth century and dramatic periods in their spouses' lives help to reconstruct some events in the history of science, to understand the motivation of their own actions and those of the founding fathers of genetics, and to retrace the ups and downs of the history of Russian science. All our heroines graduated from gymnasiums and were fluent in several languages. With a prohibition on women's education at the universities, they studied natural sciences at private higher education institutions, most often at the Higher Women's Courses. They also took part in the revolutionary movement. Their research interests took shape during their student years at the Women's Courses (M. P. Sadovnikova-Koltsova and E. I. Barulina-Vavilova), at the Shanyavskii University (R. I. Serebrovskaya), and at the Moscow Agricultural Institute (E. N. Sakharova-Vavilova). It was also during their studies that they met their future spouses: M. P. Sadovnikova-Koltsova and E. N. Barulina-Vavilova married their teachers while R. I. Serebrovskaya and E. N. SakharovaVavilova married their fellow students. Later on, while these women's professional mobility was largely determined by their husbands, the wives also greatly influenced their husbands' scientific careers. Women often remained in the shadow of their "great men", while doing a huge amount of research work. This situation that was largely due to widespread stereotypes about women's role in the family and society persists to this day.

AB The article reviews some consequences of the creation of missile and nuclear weapons in the DPRK and growing activity of Pyongyang diplomacy in Northeast Asia (NEA). It investigates the factors that contributed to the changing of domestic situation in North Korea and stimulated a dialogue with foreign countries. It also looks at the modification of Seoul's policy towards Pyongyang, analyses new priorities of South Korean leadership in developing inter-Korean relations. Seoul tries to adopt new model of bilateral and international cooperation on the Korean peninsula. Although the South Korean government intends to undertake notable steps to resume North-South exchanges, the political environment on the Korean peninsula and in NEA is not positive. The article examines inter alia the evolution of diplomatic activity of the United States, China, Russia and Japan on the Korean peninsula and in NEA. Korean nuclear crisis is not local, but influences regional and global trends. New factors of growing regional diplomatic activity are characterized. In this context, the article finally explores the impact of globalism and nationalism on modern foreign policy in NEA, mainly that of the USA and China, because these two powers play the leading role in negotiations between the DPRK and outside world. It will be necessary for all regional powers to demonstrate their will to find out any kind of final decision which would take into account the interests of two Korean states as well as of all countries involved in negotiations. Meanwhile, a positive transition of the DPRK towards market-oriented and more open society is a decisive factor for prospects of improvement in security, political and economic situation on the Korean peninsula and in NEA.

DE societal system; quality of life; integral index; management algorithm;
   sampling; principal component method; regional clusters; dynamic model;

AB The article deals with the issues of research, modeling and management of society as a societal system. The authors propose a methodology for studying society based on the system composition of the main structures of activities organization, as well as the integration of general scientific laws and approaches. The peculiarity of the methodology is that society is represented as system integrity and a unity of economic, political, social, spiritual, and cultural sub-systems. Improving population's quality of life is considered a criterion for society's development and, at the same time, the effectiveness of its management. The paper proposes the models for assessing the quality of life as an integral indicator of the society's quality of functioning and development, which allow evaluating this indicator, studying its structure, and the dynamics of its changes. An algorithm for managing the functioning quality of the societal system, based on the assessment of the integral index, is developed. A special feature of the algorithm is the complex application of data mining and dynamic modeling methods. The algorithm includes two main stages. At the first stage, data mining is performed on the quality of the system functioning in the selected area in the regional context. The results of the analysis allow identifying the clusters of regions and determining their characteristic features. The second stage involves developing the integral index structure and a dynamic model for assessing the functioning quality of the societal system on the basis of the integral index calculation, producing control actions in the form of changes in the volume of investments taking into account the characteristics of the constructed clusters. The authors consider the case of the developed algorithm implementation for quality management of social infrastructure in the regions of the Russian Federation, which allowed determining the recommended change in the level of investment in social infrastructure development by the regional clusters.

AB Research objectives: To analyze the reasons for the promulgation of the Decree of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party of Bolsheviks of August 9, 1944, "On the Status and Measures of Improving Mass-Political and Ideological Work of the Tatar Party Organization", and determine its impact on the activities of the Tatar creative and humanitarian intelligentsia in the second half of the 1940s and early 1950s.
   Research materials: Documentary sources from federal and regional archives, along with specialized studies.
   Results and novelty of the research: The authors believe that the adoption of the 1944 Decree should be considered in the context of changes in the general political situation in the country associated with the strengthening of the dictatorship of the state and the destruction of liberal ideological trends at the end of World War II. The promotion of the national spirit, necessary for the survival of the state in military conditions, lost its relevance and gave way to great-power sentiments. The Decree was used as a "whip" against the national intelligentsia, but it did not stop the development of humanitarian thought. Many creative figures recognized the ideological framework only externally, while in reality, they often went far beyond it and continued to work actively in the study of ethnic history and culture.

TI ANTI-SEMITISM IN THE LATE USSR IN THE PERCEPTION OF SIBERIAN JEWS:
   PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS
SO VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA ISTORIYA-TOMSK STATE
   UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HISTORY
LA Russian
DT Article
DE anti-Semitism; Siberia; Soviet Jews; oral history
AB The paper deals with an understudied topic of anti-Semitic manifestations in Siberia in the 1950s-1980s. Despite the fact that Siberia has always been one of the least conflicting territories, anti-Semitic / anti-Jewish manifestations were also noted here. For the post-war period, they are explained by the sharp number of the Jewish population in connection with the evacuation of the 1940s. The authors aim to determine how tolerant the surrounding population was to Jews under totalitarian ideology, how Jews who differed in origin (native Siberians and immigrants) perceived and interpreted anti-Jewish statements and actions. Sources for analysis include such ego materials as interviews and memoirs of Jews living in Siberia. The authors use 51 biographical interviews collected in Siberian cities (Novosibirsk, Tomsk, Omsk, Tyumen, Tobolsk) in 2013, 2016-2018, with people born before 1975, who had experience of living in the USSR at a conscious age. The authors rely on a methodology based on the theory of cultural trauma (J. Alexander, P. Stompka). Along with the trauma, Jews faced with anti-Semitism experienced social stigma (E. Goffman). An indicator of the traumatism of anti-Semitism is the ambivalence of its representation in memoirs, which means that the same event can be simultaneously assessed as anti-Semitic / anti-Jewish and as an "insignificant" that does not matter. The paper discusses the manifestations of state / political anti-Semitism (the "Doctors' plot" and discrimination in admission to universities). Examples of opposition of local administration to such a policy are given. The authors argue that for Siberia state anti-Semitism was less prevalent than in the central regions of the USSR. "Local" Siberian Jews faced domestic anti-Semitism. Most examples relate to childhood, while people of different ages could be carriers of anti-Jewish sentiments. Depending on the situation, Siberian Jews could demonstrate different behavioral patterns: retaliatory aggression against anti-Semitism or mimicry as a defensive reaction. It is concluded that the perception of anti-Semitism differed depending on the origin of the informants ("locals" or "migrants"). For immigrants from the central and western regions of the USSR who had experience living in these regions (with a traditionally high level of anti-Semitism of the local population) Siberian anti-Semitism is not actualized, while the "local" Siberian Jews who were born in Siberia felt it quite acutely.

TI Ethnocultural Communities in Archival Films: Vladimir Erofeev's "Beyond
   the Arctic Circle"
SO HERALD OF AN ARCHIVIST

DT Article
DE Historical source; archival ethnographic films; visual anthropology;
   Vladimir Erofeev; Far North of the USSR
AB At the turn of the 1930s, the Soviet film industry produced for the wide screen many educational films about the life of remote regions of the country, allowing the audience to make a virtual journey through the multi-structured multinational Union of the SSR. The article is to introduce Vladimir Erofeev's archival ethnographic film "Beyond the Arctic Circle" (1927), an assembled film about the "exotic" frontier region of the Far North. The socio-political and cultural-ideological context of the film creation is being analyzed. The author concludes that Vladimir Erofeev's concept of documental film was radically different from that of Dziga Vertov (poetical Constructionism) or of Mikhail Kalatozov (revolutionary romanticism) or of Nikolai Lebedev (ideology journalism). The method consistently used by Vladimir Erofeev when creating his documentary films involved systematic study of source material and its retranslation to cinema; it thus may be called "anthropological newsreel." Due to specifics of silent cinema, the film "Beyond the Arctic Circle" is a kind of visual text consisting of approximately the same number of film images and captions alternating in a narration. The film is built as a sequence of episodes describing the geography and ethnography of distinctive North-Eastern outskirts of the country. In the course of the study it becomes obvious that this film is to the utmost a documental film / chronicle, which distinguishes it from many propaganda films of the Soviet period. The source base of the research is little-known archival film and photo sources, as well as data from the Soviet periodicals and excerpts from the theoretical heritage of the film director Vladimir Erofeev. The method discovered by Vladimir Erofeev, while working on the "Beyond the Arctic Circle" film, amounts to combining research and creative approach, and thus his film conveys not just information about the events, but also provides their visual and emotional context, the vital "feeling" of the North. This is a case-study providing historical and anthropological analysis of the Far North image in the Soviet documentary. No wonder that the film "Beyond the Arctic Circle" has broken the framework of purely enlightening narrative and become an outstanding phenomenon in the cinema art and a significant experience of visual anthropology of the Soviet period, as well as a multi-layered historical source that has not lost its relevance for contemporary scientific research.

AB The work presents the results of a critical analysis of G.L. Tulchinskii's article Political Context of Narration with Karl Marx's Wert-terminology: Cost vs Value (Polis. Political Studies. 2019 No. 3). In this article, a number of characteristic trends that arose in Russian political science at the post-communist stage of its development are very clearly revealed. The key focus of the author's argumentation is a radical contrast between the value and cost traditions of the analysis of the text of "Capital" and the economic theory of Marx. On the contrary, modern works devoted to the knowledge economy and intellectual capital testify to the tendency towards creative interaction and mutual enrichment of both analytical paradigms, devoid of academic dogmatism. In this regard, in the author's opinion, Tulchinsky's ideological approach to the problem of values in Marxism at the present time is hardly capable of overcoming its traditional economical and ethical interpretations, examples of which are given in this article.

AB Inequality persists in the modern world, manifesting itself both in the socio-economic and informational spheres, and the scientific, technological, and innovative ones. The authors of the article are trying to answer the question of whether inequality can be overcome. The authors proceed from the theory of the global commons, which considers scientific, technological, and innovative development as the global commons. Moreover, according to this logic, the right to scientific, technological, and innovative development - understood as an individual and collective right, which logically fits into the process of the evolution of human rights - and the concept of the right to scientific, technological and innovative development are based on ideas of the innovative sovereignty of all states - the fundamental equality of all states in the right to innovate and develop technologies necessary to solve global problems. This right has been historically associated with decolonization, and the necessity for guaranteeing rights for the realization of human potential as a condition for realizing all other political, social, economic, cultural, and environmental rights. The authors of the article compare modern approaches to overcoming the problems of scientific, technological, and innovative inequality in the world, and analyze issues relating to the openness of science, the democratization of the process of creating innovations, and the transition to "open innovation".

AB Introduction. Jubilee histories of the Soviet and Russian universities (higher education institutions) draw scholars' attention as tools for the construction of traditions and search for a usable past. Historians scrutinize primary the past of universities as it is depicted in historical texts, but as a rule, these texts also treat the present and future of educational institutions. Exploring narratives that put all three times together, the article examines jubilee texts in their integrity. Methods and sources. The study is based on both published and unpublished narrative sources on histories of universities that usually are somehow connected with jubilees. Special attention is paid to discursive features of the texts under study. The author employs the method of discourse-analysis, as well as the method of contextualization of the examined written sources within political and social developments of the Soviet era. Analysis. The 1930s saw a gradual development of the jubilee history genre. While a lot of norms and regulations had not been implemented yet, there were distinctly visible anachronisms and factual errors. The exact place of the revolution and other landmark events had not been determined yet. The new genre gained momentum during and after the thaw period. The history of the universities of that time showed greater attention to historical detail and accuracy. At the same time, a certain model of linear history became well established; past, present, and future were clearly ordered and delineated. Results. Typical jubilee texts of the 1930s - 1980s had quite a stable structure, albeit they could vary in content. They were efficient and flexible enough for ongoing ideological campaigns. More importantly, these qualities widened the opportunities for the articulation of various visions of the university that didn't necessarily fully chime with the official ideology although they didn't explicitly confront it either.

DT Editorial Material
DE efficiency of the state's management; "deep state"; pandemic;
   Constitution of the Russian Federation; National security strategy
AB The following materials logically continue the chief editor's article "Another Step toward V. Putin's "Long State"", which was published in the previous issue of the journal "Economic and Social Changes: Facts, Trends, Forecast" (no.1, 2020). Basics of a new Russian statehood, which the President has been building for the last 20 years, are tested by epidemiological and socio-economic crises, caused by COVID-19 pandemic, and the drop of oil prices. Efficiency of the state's "manual" management, which V. Putin has been implementing during all his presidential terms, is also going through challenges. The author's position on the development of the political situation in the country, based on the analysis of facts, statistical data, results of population's sociological surveys, and experts' assessments, proceeds from the fact that, in a current difficult situation, the President personally (publicly, attracting expert community and general population) get "ahead of the curve" to maintain stability and provide conditions for the long-term implementation of the prospective political course of the country's development. Such actions include timely initiation of the large-scale discussion and the adoption of the respective law on amending the Constitution of the Russian Federation and the provision of the ensured opportunity to continue national-oriented development course for the next 15 years at least. Thus, despite force majeure global circumstances and complicated domestic situation, the President takes steps aimed at the preservation and strengthening of the Russian statehood in the future. It once again shows the historical role of V. Putin and allows us to expect with cautious optimism the Russia's "withdrawal" from the current situation without, at least, losses for national security and competitiveness while keeping prospects for further sustainable development.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE Colombia; internal armed conflict; elections; polarization; organized
   crime; terrorism; social situation; political processes
AB The paper discusses the main trends in the social and political development of Colombia in the early 21st century. Due to a compromise between the struggling parties, on the one hand, and effective mediation by international community, on the other, the internal armed conflict ended with a peace treaty signed by both forces: government and left radical guerilla. During referendum, a majority of participants did not support peace agreement. In the context of a "right drift", I. Duque, the supporter of a tougher policy towards former partisans, came to power. However, later, under pressure from international community and internal opposition, the President has taken a more cautious stance. Representatives of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) have occupied a number of seats in parliament; government does in general fulfill its financial obligations towards integrating the demobilized fighters into peaceful life, but it has failed to implement sound structural reforms. Former partisans are particularly concerned about growing attempts to revise conditions of transitional justice while the government is unable to offer them an adequate level of personal security. As a result, some dissident groups and their leaders have resumed hostilities, the guevarist (associated with the strategy of Ernesto "Che" Guevara) National Liberation Army (ELN) has also continued terrorist acts. Nevertheless, the renewal of a full-scale conflict is unlikely due to powerful security forces, small number and fragmentation of partisan units operating in some remote areas, their weak coordination and a rivalry between the FARC and the ELN. Despite relatively favorable economic situation, the President has attempted to unleash the unpopular measure of tax increase. Other challenges are student strikes demanding a reform of higher education, continuous drug trafficking, high level of violence and corruption, and the presence of more than a million of Venezuelan refugees on the Colombian land. According to the author's conclusion, amid such extreme political polarization, unresolved social problems and high level of organized crime, definitive stabilization in Colombia is an extremely complicated matter. However, the country's unconventional experience in overcoming acute armed confrontation may be useful to unblock protracted conflicts in other regions of the world.

DT Article
DE national state policy; ethnic minorities; USSR; native historiography;

AB The article analyzes the main traits of the Soviet national policy in the 1920s and 1930s. Learning about the national policy in the USSR has a great historiographical tradition with certain stages. The current stage of the study is characterized by a reassessment of the driving forces of national policy, a departure from dogmatism and political bias, the introduction of the previously unavailable written unpublished sources into academic overturn and collaboration with foreign historians. Another characteristic of modern historiography is the emergence of local studies, dedicated to national policy in some particular regions. The complexity and inconsistency of political processes, the role of national elites and departments responsible for resolving the national issue are recognized. The research projects appear and become promising which study the implementation of national policies of the 1920s and 1930s in different regions, including those not considered national. As for foreign historiography, it is only in the last 30 years that foreign authors have begun to reassess the pre-war terminology and introduce new concepts into academic turnover (for example, "the USSR as a communal apartment", "the USSR as an Empire of a positive nation", "national policy as a compromise of the elite center and regions", etc.). The topic of the status of Russian people in the USSR remains relevant. The article notes that the interest in the issue of Soviet national policy has slightly decreased recently. The topic is becoming less politically biased. The abundance of anniversary dates in the early 2020s creates favorable conditions for scholars to implement new, including international, joint research projects.

DT Article

   opinion; Northern Ireland
AB The article examines how the political situation in Britain and Brexit negotiations have transformed the public perceptions of political leaders, parties and the ruling elites in general. The author analyses data from different research centers and concludes that the public mood has significantly changed since the EU membership referendum. While politicians and the media were blaming their political opponents or certain leaders for the ongoing crisis and delaying negotiations on leaving the European Union, the society has been losing trust in all the participants of the negotiations and legislative processes, not only particular people or parties. During of negotiations with the EU led by the Prime Minister Theresa May, the withdrawal agreement was repeatedly rejected by the Parliament. Respondents of different opinion polls expressed growing pessimism in relation to the possibility of reaching a Brexit deal beneficial for the country in the near future and the perspectives of the country after leaving the EU. After the December 2019 snap elections, when the Conservative Party under the leadership of the new Prime Minister Boris Johnson received a majority in the House of Commons and therefore finally delivered Brexit, the political crisis seems to be resolved. However, important questions about the future of the UK political system and the country's integrity still remain unanswered.

AB The article discusses transformations of contemporary (neo)shamanism and phenomena associated with shamanism, drawing attention to the changes in activities of religious shamanic organisations over the past years, including attempts to establish a single religion and a hierarchy of religious power and to engage in political activities. In this regard, the article analyses most prominent events (such as the ritual killing of five camels in Angarsk (Irkutsk region, Russia)) and figures who consider themselves shamans (e. g., Aleksandr P. Gabyshev). The question is raised of how legitimate is it to associate with shamanism, and even with its new forms (neoshamanism), those transformations that go beyond the traditional understanding of shamanism as religion and culture.

AB Although social networking sites (SNS) offer functionalities for large-scale online research, user behavior and, in particular, scale and factors of their dropout from SNS-administered research have hardly been studied. In this paper we present an SNS-based experiment and survey tool and report the results of our investigation of user dropout from a research that uses this tool. This research is a pilot stage of a cross-country comparative study of political fake news recognition. At this stage Facebook and Vkontakte users from Russia have been recruited via SNS ad managing systems, asked to evaluate the truthfulness of the displayed news items and to answer a number of questions. We find that although we had to perform thousands of ad displays, among those who clicked the ad dropout rate was 60 and 65% in Vkontakte and Facebook respectively. 1,816 complete questionnaires were collected within a few days. More educated respondents, people living in or near megalopolises and those who agreed to grant access to their Vkontakte account data were significantly more inclined to complete the survey, but the major predictor of dropout was high individual speed - an indicator of low interest. Neither device type (mobile vs desktop) nor the number of questions per screen (one vs two) affected dropout. The number of leavers declined from the first to the last screens of our tool, but transition from the experiment to the survey and demographic questions produced clear peaks in the dropout curve.

AB Based on previously unknown archival materials and published sources, the intellectual biography of an ichthyologist, Professor B. S. Kostomarov (1897-1974) is reconstruct in this article. He was working in Czechoslovakia, in Brno, most of his life, contributing a noticeable mark in the history of biological science and at the same time in social and political life. The focus of article is on the paradoxes of the fate of a scientist who was managing to be as a volunteer in the Denikin army, and the organizer of a democratic student group in the Masaryk First Republic, and an active member of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. The article describes the role of B. S. Kostomarov in the history of Czechoslovak biological science. The article discusses his personal and business contacts with leading Czechoslovak scientists, his role in organizing field measurements, his experience in the creation and operation of research stations, and the importance of his applied research. Scientific activity of B.S. Kostomarov is examined from the standpoint of intellectual paradoxes: on the one hand, he made a tremendous contribution to the development of ichthyology and hydrobiology in Czechoslovakia; on the other hand, he zealously participated in the Sovietization of higher education system after the Second World War. The scientist's complex and contradictory biography is put in the context of the tragic era in which he was destined to live and work.

AB The article is devoted to the study of the meanings of the life world of Russians. The study aims to identify the content of the basic life meanings of the Kemerovo region residents. The researchers identify and characterize groups of meanings, using data from focus-group interviews conducted by the authors (October-November 2018). Three groups were identified: (1) meanings of life, taking into account the depth of the content of the main attitudes, as well as the means to achieve them (2) the meanings of the ideological (ideological) nature (3) meanings that determine the life goals of the developing modern Russian society. The analysis of meanings is presented taking into account socio-demographic, occupational and settlement characteristics of the interviewees. The article discusses options and horizons for understanding the current state and future prospects of various groups of region residents. In conclusion, the authors note that the sociocultural differences identified as in the study also show the shifts in the life meanings of Kuzbass residents in relation to Soviet and post-Soviet sociocultural attitudes, and reflect transformations in people's meanings relative to market and democratic models cultivated in recent social and political innovations.

LA English
DT Article
DE state of necessity; human rights; investment arbitration
AB The discussion on increasing the legitimacy of international investment law largely overlooks the potential of the state of necessity, as a circumstance precluding wrongfulness of States' conduct under general international law, for the protection of human rights. The present article deals with the practice of international investment arbitration in cases involving Argentina in connection with its economic crisis of 1998-2001, in which it raised the necessity defense and appealed, inter alia, to human rights. The article concludes that, as a rule, the human rights factor did not play a noticeable role for resolving the relevant disputes. The human rights discourse either had no adequate place within the merits of the disputes, or the tribunals did not take the relevant arguments seriously. The human rights argumentation tried itself within different parts of the Argentina's defense, including various elements of the necessity test, but without meaningful effect. The Award in the case of Urbaser S.A. and Consorcio de Aguas Bilbao Bizkaia, Bilbao Biskaia Ur Partzuergoa v. The Argentine Republic has demonstrated the perspective of recognizing the significance of the human rights factor in the context of "the only way" element of the necessity test: this element can unleash the potential of human rights in the disputes involving the necessity-based defense and provide the tribunals with tools capable of taking human rights more seriously in the context of investment disputes concerning emergencies. The Urbaser Tribunal position is an evidence of the evolving and expanding role of the human rights factor within the necessity test but substantial clarification of this test at the doctrinal, practical and political level is still needed to increase the legitimacy of international investment dispute resolution system.

AB The article considers the conceptual foundations of legal and constituent constitutionalism, the problem of permanent constitution and constitutional modernisation, the multiplicity of the term "constitutionalism" and the dynamic capabilities of the constitution, the relationship of the nation's right to adopt and change the constitution in Emer Vattel's views, social foundations and forms of constituent power, the influence of Hans Kelsen's normativism and Carl Schmitt's decisionism for the modem understanding of constituent power, prospects for the formation of a constituent constitutionalism in the conditions of an information society and e-government. The author explores the conceptual significance of the basic laws and the modern constitution as legal phenomena, their difference in constitutional and historical jurisprudence, the substantive characteristics of legal constitutionalism based on the model of a written, codified constitution widespread on the legal map of the world. The author discusses the scientific views of Vattel as a representative of the school of natural rights to the constitution and public authority, the differences between the constituent and legislative powers, the role of the nation's right to adopt a constitution and the right to change it. This article substantiates the scientific and political-legal significance of Schmitt's decisionism. The author believes that the Russian constitutional landscape is under a serious strain from the results of the influence of Schmitt's concept of decisionism. Political and legal forms of involving citizens in the constitutional popular monitoring of possible amendments and changes to the Constitution of the Russian Federation remain unclaimed by constitutional science and practice. The article examines Kelsen's views on the understanding of the constituent power and the basic norm. Constitutional scholars note that, at present, the democratic constitutional theory does not pay enough attention to the concept of constituent power and attribute this to the costs of the influence of Kelsen's legal positivism. The article uses the methods of discursive and comparative legal analysis, the method of constitutional hermeneutics, specific historical and formal legal methods of analysis. The article identifies the problems of regulation and implementation of constituent power in Russian constitutionalism. Conclusions are made: in the conditions of the modern information society and the e-state, attention should be paid to the development of new legal means for identifying the validity of the constitution, creating political and legal mechanisms of constitutional will and the will of the people that are adequate to technological possibilities and based on digital rights and digital constitutionalism.

AB The article is devoted to the Sino-Soviet management of Chinese Eastern railway (CER), which still stays poorly studied, full of contradictions. Despite the variety of studies on the history of CER there is a number of questions that need clarification. What was CER for the USSR and China? Was the equal terms real, not nominal? How justified were the claims of the Soviet and Chinese sides to each other? On the basis of unpublished archival sources, (in particular, Russian State Historical Archive), the article examines the points of view of both the Soviet and Chinese sides on the activities and importance of the CER, analyzes the composition of the CER Board and Management, employees and workers with Soviet and Chinese citizenship, identifies cases of parity violation. The author comes to the conclusion that the joint Sino-Soviet management of CER faced a number of problems related to the political, social and cultural differences between the two countries, as well as the international and domestic political situation. Both sides suspected each other of violating parity and exceeding authority, and treated hierarchy issues differently. In addition to language difficulties and problems of intercultural communication, the unclear prospects of the USSR in Northern Manchuria and increased Chinese nationalism played a role. Nevertheless, both the Soviet and Chinese sides have shown themselves being pragmatists and realists, using various strategies to strengthen and keep power at the CER.

AB Introduction. It is well known that since the second half of the last century, national University systems have become powerful intellectual and ideological resources not only for leading countries, but also for countries with rapidly developing economies in various parts of the world. Methods and materials. The author uses the systematic approach to the analysis of historical aspects of the development of university systems in Russia, the USA and China. The historical-comparative method allows to represent the general and the different in the dynamics of the development and strengthening of the positions of universities in the global educational space. The article uses official documents of the educational authorities of Russia, the USA and China, as well as studies of leading experts in the field of studying university education in these countries. Analysis. The analysis of the relationship between universities in the United States, China, and Russia can serve as an interesting example of how their efforts to intensify economic and political development within the states themselves go far beyond national borders and become an important factor in the acute competition in the global educational market. The article considers the main aspects of the development of the university model and the dynamics of the social function of universities in Russia, the United States and China in the context of increasing competition in the world educational space and taking into account national specifics. Results. The author notes that in spite of the common trends in historical developments of the university system in Russia, the USA and China, currently they propose different variants of competitions on the global educational market. It concerns not only different approaches to the global methodology of higher education institutions, but the great difference in cultural, social and political realities in these countries.

DT Article
DE Public diplomacy; strategic communication; national branding;
   propaganda; non-state actors; political organization of the world; state
   communication policy; official and unofficial channels of public
   diplomacy
AB In the 19605 when it first appeared as a concept public diplomacy was defined very broadly as the impact of a state on a foreign audience. In the 21st century changes in the political organization of the world have led to the strengthening of the social power a state, as well as to the expansion of the means and methods of its use to influence foreign audiences. A new state practice was developed - state policy in the field of international communication. Public diplomacy is only one of the directions of this policy. However, as a result of the initially very broad definition of public diplomacy, it has come to be identified in scientific literature with propaganda, strategic communication, and national branding. The tools developed in related fields - military, commercial - has its own specifics. The article shows that association of these activities with public diplomacy is wrong both in theoretical and practical terms, since it does not allow choosing the appropriate tools of influence for a specific situation. It is argued that under public diplomacy it is still advisable to understand such state communication with a foreign audience, which, firstly, is based on creating attractiveness, secondly, which is focused specifically on the political sphere, and thirdly, it involves dialogue. Comparative analysis of public policy in the field of international communication from different spheres will allow us to better understand the specifics and mechanisms that work in each of these areas. In the middle of the 20th century, non-state actors had not yet entered the international arena en masse, and structures that were "trackers" of state policy were included in public diplomacy in its unofficial channels. Today the situation is much more complicated: along with "trackerewithin the framework of unofficial channels of public diplomacy, there are actors of world politics who have significant independence in the world arena and often pursue state policy at their own discretion. As a result, there is often a duplication of certain points, which may be perceived by the external audience as annoying, and on the contrary, there may be contradictions in the actions of various actors of the same state. In any case, in order to somehow reduce such negative effects, it is necessary to study the activities of non-state actors (first of all, actors, and not just"trackers") of public diplomacy. Also, International Relations (in contrast to other fields of political science) does not study official channels of public diplomacy, including briefings for journalists by various state officials, especially interaction with an external audience through websites, social networks, etc. It is obvious that this subject area should attract the attention of researchers of International Relations to a greater extent than it is observed today.

AB This article is based on a presentation at the meeting of the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Sciences on September 24, 2019. It analyzes new trends in the development of the People's Republic of China and emphasizes the need for updating approaches to study of the economic and political transformation of modern China. The decline in economic growth that is determined by the influence of domestic economic processes and aggravated by restrictions on exports to the United States has forced the Chinese leadership to pay increased attention to innovation and labor productivity. Awareness of the need for deepening market reforms and enhancing openness to the outside world is combined with a policy of supporting state-owned enterprises and the implementation of government economic programs. The recentralization of political power, re-ideologization of public life, and re-Sinifization of ideology and culture are highlighted as the key features of China's modern domestic policy. This article considers new trends in the development of social sciences and humanities related to the search for a new Chinese identity supported by the authorities.

AB The relevance of this study of post-Soviet transition lies in the focus on the technically theoretical problems that are nevertheless the key to understanding regional development processes in the East of the Baltic Sea. The research aims to verify the theory of peripheral capitalism as applied to the Baltic States. The first theoretical objective is to draw a distinction between the ideas of modernisation and transformation in a regional context. The second objective is to adjust the theory of peripheral capitalism to smaller states. To study the features of the transformation of economic and political systems in the Baltics, this article conducts comparative analysis. Systemic analysis and the principles of theoretical and empirical analysis are used as well. Building on this work, the study identifies the deficiencies of the theoretical and methodological potential of transition studies. These include claims that the theoretical and methodological potential of transition as applied to post-Socialist and post-Soviet Europe has been completely fulfilled. Geographical differences between Latin America and the Baltic States are so obvious that they eclipse economic similarities between the processes and development models characteristic of the two regions of the world. An analysis of current developments in Latin America snakes it possible to forecast the economic and, to a degree, political consequences of the trends that are just emerging in the Baltics. This article seeks to prove the above thesis.

SO POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY

LA Russian
DT Article
DE collective memory; political narrative; 1993 political crisis;

AB The article continues the project devoted to framing the memory of the "nineties" in the Russian political discourse. It examines one of the most dramatic moments in the history of the post-Soviet transformation - the political crisis of 1993, which resulted in adopting the Constitution that formally is still in use today. The author examines the process of framing the memory of the events of 1993, analyzing publications of the federal print media in the post-Yeltsin period. She focuses on three time periods that reflect different stages in the development of the Russian polity - the tenth, twentieth and twenty-fifth anniversaries of the crisis, which makes it possible to trace the evolution of the revealed narratives.
   The analysis shows a noticeable change in the official discourse when V.Putin became a President - the narratives proposed by B.Yeltsin about the victory of the reformers over the counter-reforms and the suppression of an armed rebellion / prevention of civil war were discarded, while the main attention shifted to the Constitution as a "historic choice of the Russian people". At the same time, Putin uses the dramatic events of 1993 to emphasize the current "stability", which is supposed to be the main achievement of his rule. The narratives articulated by the communists and other successors of the memory of the defenders of the White House have not undergone significant changes. The author explains it by the fact that for this ideological segment the events of 1993 represent a "myth of the foundation" of Putin's regime. In liberal discourse, critical versions of the crisis narrative eventually trumped the apologetic ones. In recent years it has become especially clear that liberals and communists tend to converge on their interpretation of the consequences of the crisis (but not its causes or the assessments of the actors). However, the symbolic conflict that plays an essential role in constructing their political identities still remains.

ID BYZANTIUM
AB One of the first publications of religious and philosophical content in the Soviet press was a two-part article by S. S. Averintsev, dedicated to a comparative study of Byzantine, Old Russian, and Western spirituality, with the appendix of a new translation of psalms. The publication of special and methodically-verified arguments in the popular thick magazine was caused by the softening of church-state relations, but the significance of this publication exceeds its thematic side. In this publication, Averintsev undertook a revision of the system of genres and censorship strategies on which the industry of the Soviet thick journal and broader Soviet literature rested. Such a radical rollover of the usual framework for the production of the text was supported by the originality of the translation and by most of the arguments of the article. Some of the reasoning was not directly aimed at individual statements, but at criticizing Soviet literary production. Such a radical project allowed Averintsev to justify his own socio-political program, despite the fact that he did not work in the social sciences. However, a hidden intention against both Soviet journalism and Russian idealistic thought, and the liberal program of Georgy Fedotov in particular, which was blamed as ideologically dependent on the forms of old journalism, allowed Averintsev to develop a series of productive ideas about the political boundaries that could become the basis of the post-Soviet discussion about the mission and liability of the political class.

AB In the article, it is proposed that the collapse of Soviet society was presaged by a growing crisis in late Soviet morality. On the periphery of late Soviet morality, collective cultural practices are seen to have successfully functioned based on a limited ethics of virtue. In the absence of an alternative to Soviet ideology, social regulation started to draw upon values intended for the reproduction of local communities. A growing contradiction between the limited values of the new social class/corporate entities and the need to develop universal values for a big society is currently the key ideological legitimation problem facing the Russian political order.

AB The text provides an author's translation and interpretation of the fragments of the text Yue Ji - Records of Music, 37th chapter of the canonical Confucian treatise Li Ji - Records of Ritual, which gives an idea of the understanding of "music" by the followers of the Confucian doctrine. The text Yue-ji contains natural philosophical notions about music and also illustrates the attention paid to music in the Confucian doctrine of political governance. The characteristic features of music works were seen as a signal of social mores, the welfare of kingdoms, and the state of political governance. Confucianists believed that music could influence members of society, rulers, and the formation of human morals. These perceptions had a significant impact on the evolution of Chinese culture and civilization, and were translated into the creation of a specific institution of government, exemplified by the Yue Fu - the "Palace of Music" (or "Chamber of Music") established during the Han Dynasty. Music has gained importance in the traditional Chinese political system as an integral part of the traditional Chinese government system.

AB The article presents a general reconstruction of the policy of Prince Dmitriy Tsertelev as the editor of the Russkoe Obozrenie journal in 1890-1892. With the use of archival materials, the circumstances of founding the journal at the end of 1889 are reconstructed. On the basis of the created database, conclusions are drawn about Tsertelev's attention to the selection of authors and to various topics and headings; their correlation in the journal is demonstrated. The role of Leonid Voronov and Evgeniy Feoktistov in developing the journal is analyzed. Attention is paid to sections of journalism, prose, travel, critics, history, science, and poetry. The circumstances of cooperation of a number of authors with Russkoe Obozrenie, such as Lev Tikhomirov, Vladimir Solovyov, Konstantin Leontyev, Anton Chekhov, and Vladimir Gringmut, are considered specifically. The concept of the "non-partisan" character of Russkoe Obozrenie that is common in historiography is analyzed and a unique place of the journal in a conservative camp is determined. The author analyzes the political position of Tsertelev as the author of "The Contemporary Chronicle" and other articles. The severe criticism of liberalism and democracy, along with the proclamation of a course towards the relative isolation of Russia from Slavic affairs and European politics, were among the most characteristic features of the Russian Review in 1890-1892. The author analyzes the problems connected with the conflict between the sponsor of the journal David Morozov, its publisher Nikolay Boborykin and its editor-in-chief Dmitriy Tsertelev. The reasons that led to Tsertelev's resignation and the acute crisis in Russkoe Obozrenie in 1892 are demonstrated.

AB The evolution of the "academic sector" of Soviet historical science is analyzed, the process of its formation and subsequent development is considered. The relevance of the study is due to the methodological searches of modern historiography, focused on the study of the internal mechanisms of the development of the research tradition. The author identifies the main stages of building the organizational structure of the Soviet academic historical science, relying on a wide range of published and previously not introduced into circulation of archival documents, as well as taking into account the latest developments of modern historiographers. The author believes that the model of organizing historical research within the framework of the USSR Academy of Sciences was formed under the influence of the pre-revolutionary tradition and institutional "experiments" of the first years of Soviet power. In the course of the study, the author came to the conclusion that the first stage of the formation of the "academic sector" of Soviet historiography fell on the 1930s and was associated with the formation of the "academic center" - the Moscow institutes of the Department of History and Philosophy of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, the second stage of this process ended in 1950s and assumed the formation of "academic periphery" - institutions of the historical profile of branches, bases and departments of the USSR Academy of Sciences and republican academies of sciences. The author believes that the formation of the "academic sector" took place under the influence of external (political-ideological) and internal (scientific) factors.

DT Article
DE existence; politics; public policy; development; institution; state;
   digit; human; network; polycentricity; rhizome; assemblies; space; flow
AB The review of the monograph entitled "Public Policy. Institutions, Digitalization, Development" edited by Professor L. V. Smorgunov is a discourse about the connection of the phenomenon of politics and its public role with the phenomenon of development in the new existential reality. In the new informational polycentric and rhizomatic world, the connection of information, knowledge, culture and power is becoming more and more apparent, which results in the need to reconsider the old approaches to their conceptualization. We see the destruction of the familiar social structures, as each individual turns into a producer of truth. It drastically changes the entire sociopolitical landscape - the political relationships of power begin to penetrate into many things which at first glance have very little in common with politics. The question about the fate of political structures that used to be stable in the past - institutions, the main one being still the state - arises more and more often. To what extent will they be able, under the new conditions, to play the role of a key link for the conceptual transformation of public policy in the direction of development based on the human factor? What is the state of development in the new existential reality and what kind of new model of relations between the whole and the part in such a world can we observe? And finally, what could be the role of a digit, which is in fact identical to institutions in its semantic content - to put everything in order? It is possible that the new information and communication environment with internal free logic and clear boundaries, determined by mathematical rules and technical capabilities of modem communication means, will put everything in order. The whimsical machine-human-society assemblies that develop in this case and are able to function directionally, make us speak not of structures, but rather of space and the flow of development. We can and should speak not about institutions or grammar of a digit, but rather about a new type of political space assembly, under which connections, preserving original agent impulses, are developed. There is a real chance to preserve creative activity of such an assembly aimed at development, and, thus, the statement that it is not politics for development, but, on the contrary, development for politics, is seen as more and more legitimate.

TI REVOLUTIONARIES IN THE POLITICAL DISCOURSE OF THE SAVOYARD MONARCHY IN

DT Article
DE Sardinian kingdom; Piedmont; Savoy; Jacobins; the republican conspiracy;
   G.B. Rotondo; N. Vanson
AB The most popular point of view in modern historiography is that the Jacobin movement in Italy was consisted of a closed minority, which was ideologically and culturally isolated from other social groups (Cf. M. Broers, J. Ricuperati, G. Turi, M. Viglione). The author of the article proposes to shift the focus of attention from the "triennio repubblicano" of 1796-1799 for an earlier period of 1791-1794 and analyzes documents from the archives of Turin and Moscow in order to understand how "Jacobinism" was perceived in the political discourse of the Savoyard dynasty. As the revolution and military operations in Savoy and Piedmont developed, the term "giacobino" was deliberately criminalized and used to marginalize all radicals, "suspicious", "propagandists", "freethinkers", "republicans" all categories of opponents of the monarchy in Sardinia. The author of the article analyzes for the first time the documents from the Archive of foreign policy of the Russian Empire concerning the participation of the Russian diplomat in Turin (N. Vanzone) in the activities of the secret Republican society of Piedmont and the attitudes of Russian and Sardinian diplomats towards this fact (1794). The author basing on unpublished materials of the State archive of Turin, traced also for the first time the formation of official attitude of the Savoy monarchy towards the revolutionaries in the former Duchy of Savoy during the period of major unrest and civil war in the valley of Thones, of uprisings in Annecy, in the region of Faucigny and in Carouge (1793). The Sardinian authorities did not give up hope of restoring their sovereignty over the lost territories and perceived the "apologists of the Revolution" as bad subjects which had committed a dangerous state crime.

ID PERFORMANCE; REVOLUTION; AESTHETICS; PARODY; STIOB
AB The article discusses how and why the new nationalists, who call for political self-determination of Russians but share some ideological concepts with liberals, use stiob - form of ironic parody based on overidentification and decontextualisation, resulting in destruction of the authoritative discourse. Their entertaining, or educational-cumentertaining projects located in the gray area between politics and counterculture strive to undermine domineering political discourses (liberal, neo-Soviet, leftist, official patriotic and old nationalist) and to go beyond the left-right dichotomy. The author concludes that the main function of stiob and other forms of irony for the new nationalists is negative identification. Ambivalence of the language of stiob simultaneously attracts the target audience of nationalists ("those in the know") and does not prevent solidarizing with any political platform when needed. The article is based on qualitative analysis of narratives produced by nationalist social media influencers, including fiction, essays, talks, lectures, interviews, live broadcasts, posts in blogs, social networks and messengers.

AB Introduction. The article represents the author's interpretation of the actor composition of implementing information policy in modern Russia. Special attention is paid to the analysis of the main conditions of interaction between state and non-state structures of the Russian Federation in the process of determining priorities and strategies for ensuring information security in Russia. The problem of this research is actualized by increasing dependence of the mass communication domestic system on modern global geopolitical threats and foreign policy challenges. Russia and Russian society need a set of effective tools and methods to ensure the security and stability of the mass communication system. Methodology and methods. The main methodology of this study is the principles of the communicative approach (N. Wiener, C. Deutsch). Besides, the ideas about the technological core of political communication find their scientific and practical application (S.V. Volodenkov, M. Castells, S.V. Schwarzenberg). The analysis of the combination of public political communication and the processes of administrative-state management is based on the conclusions, which are contained in the articles of G. Lassuela and O.F. Shabrov. The empirical basis of the research is the public opinion polls of "Levada Center". Analysis. The modern world is increasingly differentiated by the degree of information richness: the more the country is informationally open, the faster the production of new ideas, their inclusion in political decisions. The modern process of political communication has shifted to greater interactivity. Information policy, political regulation of the mass communication system becomes the leading sphere of management activities of state and non-state structures. Discussion. The indicative model development of political-communicative interaction of information policy actors in the Russian Federation is hampered by a number of problems. Some of them are associated with established practices of political administration by state institutions of information processes. Other problems come from the unwillingness of civil structures to carry out the functions of public political management in the field of information security. The result is a decline in public confidence in political information and the Russian media. Results. The author proposes the main forms of coordinated interaction of state and non-state actors in the field of information regulation, ensuring the information security of the Russian Federation. The researcher substantiates the idea of the relationship of the mass communication system development with the formation of information and communication competencies of the Russian Federation population.

AB Since the return of the direct elections of the heads of the Russian regions in 2012, the terms of service of 143 regional leaders have expired. 66 leaders received an extension, while 77 did not. In the overwhelming majority of cases, the heads of the regions, supported by the federal center and the president in particular, are re-elected. What motivates the federal center's decisions to support the governor's nomination for a new term? What are the reasons why the Kremlin approves the regional governors' re-election? This article is devoted to finding answers to these questions.
   The study uses data on 104 governors, whose terms of service ended in 2012-2019, and employs the method of a binary logistic regression. The author tested several hypotheses elaborated within the framework of the political, economic and social approaches. On the basis of the regression analysis the author rejected the hypothesis that the political survival of governors depends on the regional electoral performance of the United Russia and Vladimir Putin in the federal elections. The hypothesis about the connection between the economic growth of the region and the governor's retention of the post was not corroborated. The only factor that appeared to be statistically significant for the re-election of an incumbent was the socio-economic situation in the region, which indicates that the political longevity of regional leaders is primarily determined by their ability to maintain socio-economic stability.

AB Cultural exchanges are an essential component of humanitarian interaction between countries and societies, in particular, between political partners and neighboring states whose citizens regularly communicate with each other. This paper discusses cooperation in the area of cultural exchanges between the Russian Federation and one of its Central Asian neighbors the former Soviet republic of Turkmenistan. To date, cultural exchanges and humanitarian cooperation have received very little attention in Central Asian studies, despite the attention paid to Russian-Turkmen economic cooperation and policy aspects. This paper is aimed at illuminating the modes, factors, dynamics, and defining features of the Russia-Turkmenistan cooperation in the area of cultural exchanges over the recent decade. The notions "cultural exchanges", "humanitarian cooperation", and "cooperation in the area of cultural exchanges" are explored in Russian-Turkmen diplomatic documents and the legislation of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The author has studied such sources as diplomatic documents, interviews, newsletters of state institutions and non-governmental organizations, and news archives of Russian and Turkmen media.

The thesis established in historiography about Devieir's and Menshikov's long-standing hostility, which led to a political trial known in historical science as the "case of Devieir-Tolstoy" is also had doubts. As a result, it is concluded that both Devier and Menshikov are interested in maintaining constant contact with each other.

AB The world moves toward new semantics, concept and practice of social interactions. Strategic advantage goes to systems able efficiently operate in situations of novelty and uncertainty. Proactive personality, private institutions, cross-border anthropo-social communities replace Leviathan's hierarchies, which lose previous bureaucratic certainty. Empowerment of individuals means the greater variability of global practices and gradual reconfiguration from the symphony of nations to polyphonic polities: the process, resulting in a different amount of risks. Geo-economic logic replace geo-political codes of action. Yet in the mobile world with elastic architecture, socio-cultural attraction (geo-culture) is going to dominate over both of them, accelerating in its turn the redistribution of human resources over the planet (geo-anthropology). The geo-economic model of the world demonstrates six areas: Transnational region (global governance), North Atlantic West (high technology), Pacific ring of the New East (industrial production), Tropical South belt (raw materials economy), "land-ocean" of the Northern Eurasia (very specific area) and the Deep South (trophy-economy). Forthcoming world's cartography involves geo-anthropology as the sum of processes and situations that arise during the deployment and redeployment of human resources on the planet, taking into account their quality. When modeling the new status of global community, Modernity-type regulations become invalid and new categorical apparatus emerges, somehow similar to semantics of quantum mechanics with their principles of uncertainty, complementarity etc. Geo-cultural/geo-anthropological atlas represents clusters of glocal objects with complex architecture organized by social gravity. "Heavy" entities emerge where professional/dynamic anthropological resources - intellectual and human capital of humankind concentrate. Russia demonstrates protective reactions to this new Zeitgeist; the sociocultural and anthropological catastrophe produces a deficit of national elite and active civil society. Such situation is a fundamental obstacle in the evolutionary battle for the future.

AB In the article, the authors attempted to consider changes in the general concept of the Caucasian war during the 20 and beginning of the 21' centuries, depending on the political and ideological attitudes inherent in various historical stages. The key moments of this complex and ambiguous phenomenon are analyzed, which still cause heated discussions in science and society (name, dating, reasons, Caucasian muridism, problems of Muhajirism),It is indicated that historiography of the beginning of the twentieth century, as in the earlier period, did not dispute the legality of the establishment of Russian orders in the region. It is shown that in the Soviet period, the assessment of the movement of highlanders in the East and West Caucasus depended not only on a change in the historical paradigm, but also on a change in the general direction of state policy in the field of ideology ("national liberation struggle against tsarism", "Shamil is a protege of Sultan Turkey and British colonialists","the struggle against the colonial policy of tsarism and against their own feudal lords"). Attention is drawn to the fact that the collapse of the USSR, the destruction of the Marxist concept of history, the development of national and separatist movements, the beginning of the Islamic revival in the North Caucasus contributed to the beginning of the active process of revising the assessments and events of the Caucasian War, which was the most striking event in the history of many peoples.The article concludes that, despite the abundance of work, scientists have not only yet to illuminate the little-studied aspects of the Caucasian war, but also to give an objective interpretation to many of its stages, based on scientific approaches, and not following political orders for the sake of one or another ideology.

AB Totalitarianism did not submerge into the depths of history with the twentieth century. On the contrary, it expanded the political space of its influence globally, albeit differing in a number of essential features from the phenomenon that took shape in the past century. Substantiating these conclusions, the author critically analyzes the basic - discriminatory - model of totalitarianism that has developed in Western science, based on the study of fascism in Italy, Nazism in Germany, and Stalinism in the USSR. With the exception of relict modifications, totalitarianism as a national state phenomenon has persevered in the past century. Globalization opened its path in the twenty-first century, leaving behind one-party dictatorships, mass terror, the cult of leaders, and its other properties described by the basic model. The closed paradigm "liberal democracy - totalitarianism," in which this model was formed, has also receded into the past. Afer the collapse of the USSR, the dilemma was resolved by the establishment of totalitarianism of a liberal type. Since the end of the twentieth century, liberal democratic regimes, headed by the United States, impose a western form of democracy on the rest of the world through undeclared wars, color revolutions, political pressure, and economic sanctions. The reproduction of this newly transformed totalitarianism provides technological progress, equipping it with previously unknown means of total control and violence which allows it to manipulate the political courses of many states of the world, their parties and governments, and regulate the activities of international organizations. The transformation of totalitarianism in the twenty-first century occurs in the general process of updating the socio-political structure of the world. The leading trends of this process, the author believes, do not nullify the possible prospect of establishing a totalitarian world order, but they do not make it final either.

AB The article explores the institutional aspect of the politics of memory of World War I in Soviet Russia/USSR in the 1920s and 1930s. The author characterizes the factors playing a special role in the politics of memory and the importance of 'reformatting memory'" about the war. The role of the most influential actors in the politics of memory, which played a decisive role in the adoption of the concept of "imperialistwar" in mass consciousness of early Soviet society, is revealed. These major actors were the Central Committee of the RCP(b)/CPSU(b), the Red Army, and the Comintern. The specificity of activities of the Red Army and Comintern and their interaction in managing mass political campaigns on anniversaries of the war is discussed. The organizational mechanism of mass commemorations devoted to the "imperialist war was reconstructed on the basis of archival materials of the Agitprop Central Committee of the RCP(b)/CPSU(b), the Agitpropotdel of the Political Administration of the Red Army, and the Agitprop Comintern Department. The special role of "anniversary" campaigns in promoting the concept of "imperialist war," involving the masses in public commemorations, is explored. The author analyzes the activity of state structures in creating the Associations of World War veterans, the institutionalization and ideologization of their commemorative practices, and displacement of alternative memory narratives. The article characterizes the evolution of the politics of memory andthe adjustment of the concept and change in the use of the image of war in propaganda of the mid-late 1930s.

AB This article analyzes Macedonian foreign policy during the process of joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). We use a modified version of Robert Putnam's multi-level game concept to show the role of domestic actors in determining Macedonian foreign policy. Based on an analysis of the interactions between the main domestic actors, we identify the reasons for the rapid resolution, after a long pause, of the question of Macedonia's name and membership in NATO. We use a case-study approach and analyze the available data on the ratio of actors within the existing institutions, key events in the political struggle, and programmes through which the parties formulated foreign policy options. Further, we note the reasons for Greece's concessions using the concept of multi-level games. We identify a number of important conditions for the formulation of Greece's position: it is important which party controls the cabinet, whether ruling party coalition partners are ready to support the actions of the cabinet, and whether the actions of the cabinet meet the ideological expectations of other parties. We conclude that three simultaneous conditions made it possible for Macedonia to presently be on the verge of accession to NATO. First, Macedonia's cabinet was formed by a party ready to accept Greece's conditions. Second, the party opposed to the country's renaming occupied less than one third of the seats, making a constitutional majority in the assembly possible. Third, because Macedonian bloc alliances are weak, allies of the anti-renaming party were willing to go against the party forming the bloc.

DT Article
DE insurance; risks; management of risks; functions of insurance;

AB The article considers the position and meaning of insurance in the social-economic system of Russia. Insurance is associated primarily with protection of the property interests under risky events. There is a large classification of risks, which is closely related to the insurance institution, and the authors analyze some types of risks providing relevant contemporary examples. Insurance is a means of the risk management system; however, the current economic, political, and social situation has a direct impact on the insurance system. Thus, in periods of instability, insurance companies have to adapt to the economic situation and financial possibilities of people to purchase insurance products. Insurance as a type of activity performs two groups of functions - economic and social. The main task of insurance is to implement effective measures of insurance protection from risky events. The article also considers activities of insurers in Russia from 2012 to 2018: the number of insurance companies, the authorized capital, the peak volume of foreign deposits, insurance payments, reinsurance operations, etc. The authors present two types of insurance - voluntary and compulsory - and consider the features of each type. The data of sociological surveys allows to analyze these features and to identify the role of voluntary and compulsory insurance in the social-economic system (tasks, functions, and so on).

AB The paper aims to study the USSR's participation in the International Hygienic Exhibition in Dresden in 1930 in the context of Soviet and German history. We examine the preparation of the Soviet pavilion and work of the exhibition, as well as the perception of the Soviet exposition by the German press and evaluation of the exhibition by Soviet officials. The article is based on archival materials from the fund of People's Commissariat of Health of Soviet Russia in the State Archive of the Russian Federation (GARF, F. A482): correspondence of the People's Commissariat of Health regarding the preparation and conduct of the exhibition, orders, minutes of meetings, reports, clippings from the German press, and so on.
   From the outset, the USSR's exposition was conceived as an international political action, and, as a result, it became more a political manifestation than an event in the field of hygiene. The 1930 Dresden exhibition showed a difference in the political and scientific agendas of different countries. If Germany organized the exhibition to demonstrate its scientific and technological superiority in the field of hygiene, the USSR used hygiene merely as an instrument of political propaganda in the international arena.
   German press praised the artistic design of the Soviet pavilion, noting the role of Lazar Lissitzky. At the same time, observers of German newspapers did not believe the charts of mortality and morbidity rates in the USSR and believed that the USSR demonstrated non-existent achievements.

ID ECONOMIC SANCTIONS; DETERMINANTS; SUCCESS; POWER
AB The development of the US foreign policy tools in the 20th century resulted in sanctions becoming one of the most convenient means for achieving administration's goals on the international arena, as well as a useful tool in domestic politics. Institutionally established within the scope of the executive branch, buttressed by the US dominance in the world economy and viewed as a "humane" way of influencing foreign elites, it does not demand significant political capital and, as a result, can be implemented without deep strategic thinking.
   Current US policy towards Russia is constrained by the framework of the sanctions regime, created by Barak Obama Administration in 2014. This regime is inherently inert and is likely to determine the scope and methods of the US policy towards Russia for the foreseeable future regardless of the priorities of the country's leadership. This article seeks to study the creation of the regime and explain the logic of decision-making process regarding this issue. Utilizing the approach of Francesco Giumelli, who developed a system of factors to explain the logic of a sanctions policy, the author shows that the US sanction policy towards Russia was framed by the desire to demonstrate the ability to mobilize international community and reaffirm its commitments to the security of the Eastern Europe. Low profile of the Ukraine issue on the US foreign policy agenda as well as low political cost of the escalation towards Russia resulted in sanctions becoming a substitute for a foreign policy strategy and were not accompanied by the analysis of the situation, determination of goals and the parameters for evaluating the success of the policy. The deficiency of such an approach is accentuated by the comparison with the European Union who paid a higher price for its sanctions and, despite a popular in Russia notion of a unified "West", not only resisted the will of the US, but acted as a deterrent for its actions.

AB The process of changing the conceptual foundations of Russian scientific diplomacy as an instrument of foreign policy and one of the forms of international scientific and technical cooperation over a twenty-year time span, the chronological boundaries of which are determined by the adoption of key strategic documents in this area, is examined. Based on the analysis of the regulatory framework, a sample of doctrinal sources related to the international aspects of the state scientific policy has been compiled. Through their analysis and parallel comparison with the Foreign Policy Concepts of the Russian Federation of 1993, 2000, 2008, 2013 and 2016, key transformations of the perception and vision of scientific diplomacy by decision-makers in the field are identified. Based on the results of the systematization of guidelines and value orientations reflected in the relevant political and determining documents, the periodization of the formation of scientific diplomacy was carried out with the identification of two stages. The first (1996 - mid-2000s) is characterized by a transition from a liberal paradigm to a realistic one, a certain politicization, and national interests at the forefront. The second stage (mid-2000s - 2016) is characterized by a reorientation to the economic dimension of international scientific and technical cooperation with a clear formation of scientific diplomacy as a concept in its modern form. It is shown that this evolution proceeded relatively smoothly in line with the objective changes in the international situation, Russia's position on the world stage, as well as adjustments to its foreign policy. Along with this, the role of E. M. Primakov as one of the ideological founders of modern Russian scientific diplomacy was identified and outlined.

The researchers focused on the relationship between memory and identity, historical consciousness and "historical politics". The task is to include in the actual perspective of the "history of memory" specific studies of the historical and political culture of modern times. From this position, the author reflects on a new book by the well-known Russian historian and English scholar Marina Aizenshtat, dedicated to the role of myths and knowledge about the past in the political culture of Britain in the second half of the 18th century.

DE Pilgrim Fathers; New Plymouth; collective memory; myth; USA
AB The purpose of the article is to characterize the basic ideas of the residents of the United States about the history of the Pilgrim Fathers that have been identified in modern historiographic studies. Sources and research materials used in the article are presented by the works of historians published in the USA in 1990-2019 and devoted to the collective memory of the American nation.
   The story of the founding of the Pilgrim Fathers of a settlement in New Plymouth is one of the meaningful plots of US history.The article shows the internal dynamics of the myth of the Pilgrim Fathers in the context of the social and political transformations that the USA went through over 400 years existence.
   The article demonstrates how this myth was used in the rhetoric of competing groups. For example, the descendants of the British colonialists, who played a dominant role in the life of American society for a considerable time, rooted their identity in the ideology of the settlers of New Plymouth. At the same time, the author shows the experience of attributing the myth of the Pilgrim Fathers among immigrants from southern and central Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries.
   The author notes that the image of the Pilgrim Fathers had a powerful competitor in the struggle for the status of the ancestors of the nation. Until the middle 19th century the story of the Pilgrims was opposed by the myth of the Indian princess Pocahontas, who was popular in the southern states. The image of Pocahontas crashed along with the defeat of the Confederation of the South in the Civil War. Pilgrim Fathers firmly occupied the position of the national ancestors.
   The author notes that this perception by Americans of their "roots" dominated until 1970s of the 20th century, when revision of ideas about the past began in the wake of social movements and the "explosive" development of new directions in historical science. The traditional story of the pilgrims was deconstructed. The main initiators in this deconstruction of the dominant ideological discourse were the Indians, who considered themselves victims of European colonization.
   Summing up, the author believes that there are cyclic repetitions in the use of the myth of the Pilgrim Fathers: each new peak in the popularity of the history of the pilgrims occurred at times when a single American identity was challenged. The author concludes that the image of the Pilgrim Fathers survived a series of transformations from the symbolic ancestors of white Anglo-Saxon Protestants to the forerunners of all immigrants of the past and future. The myth continues is developing due to this versatility. It remains the foundation of American national memory, despite ongoing critical reevaluation.

Despite the granting of "university autonomy" and the attainment of control over governmental higher education policy, the professoriate faced numerous challenges from Russian society, from junior colleagues and students. The article demonstrates that the metropolitan universities, considered to be the traditional centers of the Russian liberal movement, adopted a strict policy towards professors who had been appointed by the old regime but whose appointments had not been ratified by faculty vote. At the same time, the metropolitan universities appeared consistently to support maintaining the university hierarchy and to oppose artificial democratization of universities.

AB The article deals with the so-called "question of the legitimacy of Chinese philosophy" (in the aspect of ancient Chinese thought of the 5th - 3rd centuries BC). Three arguments are considered against the presence of philosophy in ancient China: 1) the absence of the word "philosophy" (implying the concrete tradition) in the ancient Chinese language; 2) the lack of rational argumentation in ancient Chinese thought; 3) the lack of political and spiritual freedom in ancient Chinese society. Based on data from ancient Chinese literary sources, the author criticizes these arguments and concludes that 1) there was an equivalent to the word "philosophy" in the ancient Chinese language, although with a much lesser theoretical burden, and there is no need to demand for generic relationship to European tradition to be called "philosophy"; 2) rational argumentation was significantly widespread in ancient Chinese philosophy; 3) there were concepts synonymous to the concept of human freedom and of the value of the individual in ancient Chinese philosophy. All opposing opinions from the point of view of the author of the article should be regarded as an unscientific simplification of the actual variety of ancient Chinese thought.

AB The methodological apparatus of social construction of technology (SCOT) was used to answer the question about the reasons for choosing the exact variant from competing designs of computer network for managing the Soviet economy. These variants were developed in the early 60s of the twentieth century. The chosen approach was later implemented as an automated system of planned calculations of the USSR State Planning Committee (ASPR). To answer the question, I restore the different interpretations of the future computer network, which were given by different developers (a working group led by N. E. Kobrinsky, the Interagency Scientific Council led by V. M. Glushkov and the Central Statistical Bureau). Based on the speeches of the heads of departments and the specifics of the tasks they needed to solve, I formulate problems that were considered significant by the main actors of the process (Gosplan, Central Statistical Directorate, Politburo).
   I conclude that the initial project of the network of computer centers was not focused on solving the urgent problems of specific customers and was based on the assumption of such a fast development of economic and mathematical methods that was not confirmed by practice. The Central Statistical Directorate project did not contain any decision support tools, which could not satisfy the Politburo. The Politburo regularly set economic tasks to the State Planning Committee and required various options for their solution to choose from.
   As a result, it was the Gosplan's version of the computer network that received support and was implemented in the 70-80s. It was a "stripped down" version of the initial project sharpened to solve planning problems which the Gosplan considered the most important.

AB Globalisation is a controversial issue in education in terms of its positive or negative impact. The given article presents the review of the existing literature with regard to the benefits that globalization brought to Kazakhstani and Russian higher education and some concerns arose. The authors of the article analyze such educational phenomena pluses as university autonomy, academic mobility, university rankings and English language proliferation. Substantial modernization of higher education content in accordance with the requirements of society and the state to the specialists' education level, including foreign languages is necessary in the conditions of the economic, socio-political and social relations transformation. The revision of traditional paradigm in the general system of higher education is due to the objective need of society for an individual, aware and practically realizing his vocation and purpose in various types and international practice arising. Regarding the concerns that accompany the process of globalisation of higher education in Kazakhstan and Russia, the article considers and refutes the issues that come from the popularity of English language, the probability of colonization of Kazakhstani culture and brain drain.

AB Introduction. In spite of the fact that major researchers of Gregory Palamas' theology, Robert Sinkewicz and John Demetracopoulos, offered detailed explanations of when and for what 'The chapters on physics' of Gregory Palamas were written, it seems that this issue was not finally resolved. Methods. This article, therefore, has two goals. The first is to answer the question why in 'The chapters on physics' the polemic against Barlaam and Akindynos, although it occupies a large part of the treatise, is presented as a part of the broader theological and philosophical program of Palmas, and what role does the cosmological part (1-14 chapters) play in the structure of the treatise. In the author's opinion, such a statement of the question will allow us to understand what Gregory Palamas was guided by when writing the text. The second objective is to offer a social portrait of the addressee of this treatise, delivering some of representatives of the stratum on which the Palmas was oriented. Analysis. In answering the first question, special attention is paid to chapter 81 of the treatise, which, in the author's opinion, reflects the intent of the entire text, namely, to demonstrate that the logic according to which something indivisible can be thought of as divisible without ceasing to be indivisible, works not only in the case of essence and energy, that is, in theology, but also in cosmology and anthropology. In answering the second question, the focus is on the figure of Matthew Kantakouzenos, who was at the time of writing the treatise in conflict with his father, emperor John VI Kantakouzenos, thereby causing discord in the political party, which at that time was a defender of the ideas of Hesychasm. It was Matthew Kantakouzenos, in the author's opinion, or the social stratum behind him, who could be the recipients of the treatise. Results. The analysis of the treatise and its historical context shows that it was written largely for political reasons as a program text of Hesychasm, equipped with natural science and philosophical tools, since its recipients were both the broad educated strata of Byzantine society and direct participants in political life in the middle of the 14th century.

AB The relevance of the paper is caused by the fact that the current pension system did not satisfy either citizens, since their pensions were extremely miserable, neither employers due to the high level of contributions to the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation, nor the government, since the low level of pensions caused social and, as a consequence, political tension, nor the subjects of the Russian Federation, since the unfunded pension system obliged the regions to deduct funds from their own funds to cover pension obligations to subsidized regions. The way out of this situation is the creation of a new pension reform, which will increase the size of the pension by increasing the income of the pension system itself. The main goal of the pension reform is to increase the welfare of Russian citizens after they retire. The subject of the study is a new pension reform, the stimulus of which was to become a transition from an unfunded to a defined contribution pension system. The aim of the study is to identify the main economic reasons for creating a new pension reform. Methodology. To study the new pension reform, the main indicators are systematized: the minimum length of service for assigning an insurance pension, the amount of pension points for the period from 2015 to 2024 and subsequent years, and pension calculation formulas. Results. According to the new pension reform, the employee is encouraged to show full salary for employers to pay insurance contributions. The conditions are created to remove real wages from the "shadow". The unfunded pension system caused social instability, caused a conflict of generations, workers and employers, destabilized the authorities. The new pension reform is designed to provide conditions for mutual assistance of generations and social partnership. The unfunded pension system led to the fact that pension payments were a heavy burden on the economy. The new pension system, at the expense of the funded part of the insurance contribution, creates an investment resource of "long money" (with a demand period of 25-30 years). Thus, the pension system not only serves elderly citizens, but also really works to develop the domestic economy.

AB Adaptation of students with chronic diseases to the university educational environment is an important challenge in keeping with the equal opportunity strategy. This process is fraught not only with difficulties, but also with those opportunities that can be created within the framework of the versatile social activity of students. The aim of the research is to study the correlation between academic adaptation and adherence to various forms of social activities in students with chronic diseases and those without health limitations. The study involved 419 full-time students. We used an original questionnaire aimed at identifying socio-demographic characteristics, a methodology for assessing the components of academic adaptation and a scale of commitment to various forms of social activities. Our research revealed differences in adherence to the forms of social activities. We identified multiple linkages between academic adaptation and Internet cognitive, educational and socio-political forms of activities among students with chronic diseases, as well as linkages between leisure, civic, educational, protest, radical protest and subcultural forms of activities among students without chronic diseases. We found specificity in predicting academic adaptation in students' commitment to certain forms of social activities. We offer recommendations for psychological and pedagogical support of academic adaptation to students with chronic diseases.

AB The so-called "memory wars" have been the subject of close attention for several years, and sometimes even fierce debate among researchers - experts in the field of political science, historical science, communication theory, etc., and not by accident: events of the past (one can make a reservation: of what is meant by the past) "fall over" into the present, forming various patterns of sociocultural, ethnocultural, political identities in the present, and thereby, to a certain extent, affecting the future. Are these processes directed and controlled - or, conversely, are they spontaneous? How can readers and viewers relate facts and interpretations of historical plots, concerning the fact that these tasks can be of considerable difficulty even for professional historians? And to what extent ways of dealing with history become instruments in the political space of modern Russia? Obviously, these questions have been asked more than once on various media platforms and still do not lose relevance. The article focuses on the analysis of a number of the most characteristic practices of production, reproduction and interpretation of historical subjects in Russian mass media: in Internet versions of so-called "traditional" media, as well as in "new media" (zines, imageboards, etc.). We proceed from the fact that the information environment sets specific parameters for the treatment of history: its events in digital space not only have "technical reproducibility", but also the speed of this reproducibility is very high; history is being re-writed no longer in a figurative, but in a literal sense, in real time and not by members of the expert community (whatever this community is). Information receives a visual dimension that is significant for the audience; one of the expressive manifestations of this is the culture of memes. Thus, historical memory is once again becoming a battleground for political conflict: in this case, between agents of traditional media and new actors in the digital space.

AB This paper focuses on the concept of the scientific-technical revolution. This concept is relevant today most of all in the context of historiographic studies of the Soviet period or the reflection of contemporary technological transformation from the Marxist position. The article demonstrates its relevance in the context of important contemporary issues. For a conceptual framework, the author uses the works on the social history of science by J. D. Bernal, the contemporary studies of science, technology and society, and the critical theory of technology, which seeks to integrate the philosophy of science and technology into topical socio-political discussions. The author reveals the concept of the scientific-technical revolution as describing the radical transformations taking place since the beginning of the 20th century in science, society, and technology. These transformations manifest the essential social and technological character of science and its previously hidden contradiction. The social character of science involves an increasing number of participants of these transformations, but the technological character leaves them passive objects of the efficiency requirements. However, the scientific- technical revolution offers a lesson in overcoming this contradiction, creating conditions for the activity of various participants - scientists, nature, lay experts, and technologies themselves. The emphasis on the radical revolutionary changes that have occurred with science allows us to keep in the spotlight the foundations of modern problems and how to solve them.

AB The article studies the factors that shape the political attitudes of the elites. Using data from semi-formalized interviews with municipal deputies and heads of administrations in cities and regions of the Penn Territory, the author identifies the reasons for the different positions held by politicians about the issue of canceling direct elections for mayors and municipal heads. The results of this analysis showed that the successful experience of the electoral struggle has not affected political attitudes, and does not provide a sufficient basis for the formation of democratic values. Calculation of data by the Fisher exact test method showed a statistically significant relationship between political status (whether insider or outsider) and the political attitudes of the local elites. A substantive analysis of the collected interviews made it possible not only to systematize the main arguments for legitimizing authoritarian and democratic practices, but also to clarify the role the legacy of the past plays in the successful installation of undemocratic orders. Negative experiences of direct elections, associated with conflict between elites and general managerial inefficiency, is a significant argument for simplifying authoritarian legitimation.

AB The article reflects on the formation of political science in Russia. It is argued that Soviet political science is an integral and organic part of Russian political science. This is one of its historical periods, when, like it had happened before, Russian political science took an original form, going through a thorny path from complete denial and oblivion to official recognition in 1989. It is stated that political scientists have developed a biographical outline of the history of Russian political science connecting the past with the present It is concluded that it is necessary to create an intellectual history of Russian political science, including a detailed description of all trends, approaches and schools from the XI century to the present time.

DT Article
DE globalization; global mass culture; world order; civilizational
   tendencies and prospects of world development; world civilizational
   networks; civilizational risks of world development; crisis of a world
   order; parallel societies
AB The article is devoted to the problem of civilizational perspectives and alternatives to modern world development. The purpose of the study is the demarcation of global trends in this development: preservation or weakening of the highest spiritual principles of social change regulation. The basis for the formulation of this problem is the ongoing philosophical, scientific and political discussion in the world about trends and prospects of modern globalization in terms of its impact on the world order, the possibility of managing world processes. The first two sections of the article are devoted to this topic. One of the main results of this discussion can be considered as recognition of a decline in controllability of social change, a growing danger of weakening and disintegration of world civilizations, consisting in social costs and criminal consequences of globalization: the spread of corruption, conventional and organized crime linked to terrorism; the fall of the previous globalization of high culture. It is noted that cultural globalization in all its complexity factors, processes and trends cannot be reduced simply to the spread of modern patterns of behavior and consciousness. No less, and even more important with regard to the moral and ethical content of these patterns, is closely related to their global transfer disorder deviant behavior of different social groups. In these conditions, the question of civilizational prospects of world development is of great scientific and practical importance. The article deals with the alarmist views on the future of world civilization, which are widespread in the scientific and expert community: "return to history", "threats of modern barbarism", the actualization of archaism. The last section of the article examines civilizational risks of modern world development associated with simplified variants of self-organization and self-regulation of global social changes that go beyond the civilizational principles and values of "decent" and "right" behavior or undermine them. It is concluded that there is an increase in tension - spiritual, moral, intellectual - in perception of the main landmarks of world development (focus on rapid social success, unlimited freedom of action versus focus on the highest, transcendent principles and values) and in views on its trends (global interdependence of countries and peoples versus possible split of the world and humanity). The global danger is not the prospect of a clash of civilizations, but civilizational disorder.

DT Article
DE Postmigrant Theater; Migration; Artistic Representations; Urban

ID THEATER
AB This article reveals the relationship between the representations of migrants' social experiences in theatrical productions and the institutional positions of Berlin and Moscow theaters that address migration issues. The study was based on in-depth interviews with participants of the projects Winterreise, The Situation (Maxim Gorki Theatre), and Come as You Are (Dock 11) in Berlin, and Akyn-opera (Teatr.doc) and Svan (Meyerhold Center) in Moscow. The fact that the attention of German and Russian societies is focused on different types of migration-forced in the first case and labor in the second-certainly affects artistic representations. However, in both contexts I consider the performances in which migrant artists with professional backgrounds took part. The main thesis of the article is that if in Germany productions with migrants are largely predetermined by the fact that theaters perform the role of a political forum, in Russia we observe the opposite trend. The case of Akyn-opera revealed that the theater's attempt to generate civic initiatives and involve migrants in them could not succeed for several reasons. Acknowledging this, I deliberately refrain from assessing the analyzed performances in terms of their "success." The interviews that I conducted show that the high degree of politicization of German theaters is not a self-evident value for artists with migrant background (with all due respect to the promigrant position of the German theater community). As for Russia, despite the fact that Akyn-opera did not become a "bridge" between conscious townspeople and migrant communities, this project had unexpected consequences for its participants. Those who are professional artists, although they did not get the opportunity to return to their main vocation, raised their status in the diasporic community and established themselves as artists for a certain segment of the Russian public. In addition, Akyn-opera has become an unprecedented testimony to migrant workers' experiences of living in Moscow.

AB The article explores activities of Petrograd's scientific societies and their relations with changing state power in 1917, especially legal and financial aspects of their functioning and everyday life in the context of an acute socio-political and economic crisis. The study uses different sources, in particular legislative and regulatory acts adopted by the Provisional Government to define procedures for the creation and functioning of such societies in 1917, ficing their rights and obligations and regulating their relations with the authorities. (These materials are housed in the State Archive of the Russian Federation, the Russian State Historical Archive, the Central State Historical Archive of St. Petersburg, the Central State Archive of St. Petersburg, and the Archive of the Russian Academy of Sciences and its St. Petersburg Branch.) The author also used materials from periodicals of scientific societies from 1917-1918. In 1917, scientific societies actively cooperated with the authorities, and the authorities in turn found it expedient to support their activities, assigning subsidies assisting in solving economic issues. Despite difficulties, scholars in that crucial period of history managed to preserve these societies as important organizational forms for pursuing scholarship. This study was funded by RF BR according to the research project N2 18-011-00730 (Self-Organization of the Russian Science in the years of crisis: 1917-1922).

AB After the October Revolution, the main goal of the Soviet Government's foreign policy was to overcome its diplomatic isolation, to which various tools were employed. Great importance was given to science diplomacy avant la lettre, most especially by emphasizing the diplomatic role of scientific societies. Based on archival sources which had previously been unexamined, the article discusses the international activities of scientific societies during the 1920s, as well as the measures taken by the Soviet Government and its authorities to encourage the restoration and development of prerevolutionary international links of Russian scientific societies as well as the creation of new ones. This article also analyzes the main practices of Soviet scientific diplomacy, focusing on different forms of international collaboration, such as publishing exchanges, increasing the membership of foreign scientists in national societies, and foreign trips to participate in international scientific meetings and visit museums, archives and libraries. In this context, scientific societies actively tried to fulfill the geopolitical mission assigned to them by the Soviet state and worked to protect national interests at the international level in controversial subjects. However, in the early 1930s, under the influence of political changes in the USSR and the world, the country again found itself in diplomatic isolation, and international scientific contacts were suspended.

AB The article discusses the process of building the civil identity of young people in conditions of social and political tension, from a regional perspective. The formation of civic identity is a real problem of modern Russian society. The process is complicated by changes in the socio-political of the various regions. The media stimulates public discourse around the protest activity of young people. In the context of this scientific interest, the research presented in this article is carried out. Its empirical material is obtained during a grant study by the authors at the end of 2019. The research methodology is based on conflict resolution technology. As an empirical basis, materials from three focus group surveys, fifteen in-depth interviews and regional-minded internet resource content analysis on the topics of socio-political youth activity were interpreted. It is concluded that the republic of Tartaristan, as one of the regions of the Russian federation that has specifics in its economic, ethnic, and religious life, has become a platform for gathering empirical information.

AB Analysis of the level of knowledge on the problem allowed us to define the purpose of the article, that is to identify main trends and features of formation and implementation of smart and innovative potential of mining engineers, which determined the efficiency of the coal industry during the period of "perestroika". Documents of federal archives, regulatory documents of authorities and statistics were the sources of the study.
   Methodological basis of the research is the theory of modernization, which is based on the following research methods: comparative-historical and problem-chronological. Comparative-historical method proved that in the last years of the USSR mining engineers, despite certain losses, managed to maintain a high level of intelligence which is able to operate in market conditions. Comprehensive analysis of the problem under study revealed the drawbacks in the training system of mining engineers in the USSR (narrow specialization, lack of knowledge in the field of economics, psychology, etc.). Problem-chronological method showed that soviet mining engineers found it difficult to realize their intellectual abilities in the field of coal mining due to the growth of socio-political and economic instability.
   The authors believe that the main result of achievements of mining engineers in the years of "perestroika" was a stable growth of coal production in the country up to 1988. The most important task at that time was to increase the level of compliance of the coal industry with requirements of scientific and technological progress. This goal was achieved in two main directions: increase of funding and creating new forms of research and production activities.
   The authors argue that further development of smart and innovative potential of mining engineers in the field of coal mining and processing was hindered by many system, industry and personal problems. Centrally-controlled economy did not allow to realize this potential to the full extent. This fact limited creative abilities of innovative engineers to five-year plan indicators. Although these indicators no longer met the requirements of the world technological pattern. The article proves that smart and innovative potential of mining engineers needed a serious adjustment not only in the use of advanced technologies, but also in developing skills for independent generation of ideas and increasing their own competitiveness.
   The authors concluded that in 1985-1991 the potential of mining engineers focused on the search of new forms and methods to improve efficiency and competitiveness of mines and sections, which contributed to transition toward market relations.

AB The article attempts to polemically challenge the main methodological approaches to the specification of politics and power, developed and promoted by the authors of the monograph "Domination versus politics: the Russian case. The effectiveness of the institutional structure and the potential of strategies for political change", published in 2019 by the "Political Encyclopedia Publishers". The assessment of this work is generally positive. At the same time, the authors of the monograph use the Aristotelian-Arendian paradigm, which carries visible signs of historical and theoretical fatigue, as a cognitive basis for characterizing the modem space of politics and power. As part of the polemic with the authors of the monograph, the article notes that the colonization of official structures and institutions of power in a modern state by informal networks of the ruling elite increasingly limits the tools of public policy in making state decisions. Assumptions are made about the main trends in the evolution of relations between the elite and non-elite strata in the modem state, and about the further narrowing of the social space for "citizens' politics".

ID SELF-DETERMINATION
AB National reification takes place when the state defines itself as a tool to protect the interests of a particular ethnic group and tries to create a homogeneous society unified on the basis of linguistic, cultural, historical, ideological and religious principles. This inevitably leads to the monopolization of politics (common good) by the majority's culture, and at the same time, to the marginalization and exclusion of the minority's culture and its obliteration in the future. This marginalization does not imply a discrimination because the minority is not denied civil rights, but its political activity from now on implies an engagement with the majority's culture. This effect appears in waves. The first wave preceded World War II; the second wave started in the nineties and affected the new post-Soviet and Eastern European countries. National reification is closely related to the principle of democracy; since the minority retains this obviously ineffective right to participate, all other forms of protest become inaccessible to it. National reification is an objective and general tendency of the modern day. It fills the legitimacy deficit and not only "launches"a new state, but also generates internal threats that justify its existence. As a result, from the very first days, a new state is being created as a totalitarian and emergency one that can use extreme, but justified and legitimate measures. The principle of self-determination cannot be used against the process of national reification as it implies an obligation of conduct and has a narrow scope. Moreover, its beneficiaries, by not being states, are deprived of the procedural tools needed to protect their rights. It could be interpreted differently: we should recognize the right to secession for the nations faced with the choice of obeying or losing identity. This interpretation, however, is an unrealizable utopia. Human rights are completely helpless in the face of national reification or, rather, are indifferent to it. The reason is a fundamental denial of the collective principle. Therefore, international law does not solve the problem of national reification. On the contrary, all the structures of the modern order (statehood, legitimacy, democracy, human rights, international law, etc.) generate this problem. The solution of the problem is vitally important and, at the same time, extremely difficult. It cannot be cosmetic, but should affect the very foundations of international law.

AB The article is based predominantly on sources of personal provenance (memoirs of participants and eyewitnesses of the events of 1920 in Arkhangelsk, stored in the "fonds of memoirs" in the State Archive of the Russian Federation, State Archive of the Arkhangelsk Region, Central State Archive of Historical and Political Documents of St. Petersburg, Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History, Vologda Regional Archive of Contemporary Political History, Scientific Archive of the Karelian Research Centre of the Russian Academy of Sciences and scientific archives of the local history museums in the Arkhangelsk region). These documents allow us to expand our understanding of the events that took place in Arkhangelsk in February 1920 and to supplement the information of other, synchronous, sources on this interesting fact of the Civil War: attempt to peacefully transfer power from the administration of the Northern Region (a quasi-state entity with its center in Arkhangelsk) to the command of the advancing Red Army through a "transitional government" formed from activists of local trade union organizations. The nature of the Civil War associated with ideological disorientation of the population manifested itself in the desire of certain groups (i.e., White soldiers who defected from the Red Army, workers who welcomed the change of power in 1918) to rehabilitate themselves in the eyes of the Soviet authorities. It was reflected in their insistence on establishment of the "revolutionary order" in the city even before the arrival of the Red Army. When the prepared script was disrupted, the city plunged into anarchy for several days. This article is an attempt to reconstruct the events of February 1918 in Arkhangelsk in order to demonstrate the impact made by individuals driven by their own motivations, interests, and goals on the events of historical significance.

The author explores the degree of institutionalization of interstate relations between Germany and each of these countries in the political sphere. The key attention is paid to the cooperation at various multilateral negotiating platforms for the resolving of security problems. The scientific paper shows the key variants of the transformation of foreign military presence in Germany since the 1990s (first of all, on the examples of Western European countries' military presence in Germany). The key factors which determine the nature of interaction between Germany and Western European countries during the creation and functioning of different multilateral military mechanisms outside and inside the NATO zone of responsibility are demonstrated. The author of the article makes a conclusion about general dynamics of relations between Germany and the regional players in political-military sphere during the 2010s.

DT Article
DE Russian Empire; Caucasus; Caucasian Viceroyalty
AB The article deals with the patronage network of the first Caucasian Viceroy Michael Vorontsov. The research is based on the patronizing letters of the Viceroy to the Director of the Caucasian Committee Vladimir Butkov, as well as on the correspondence between Michael Vorontsov and employees and supporters. Michael Vorontsov's fraction consisted of representatives from various social groups: military, officials, local nobility, religious leaders, merchant circles. This diversity is explained both by the peculiarities of the personality of the Caucasian Viceroy, who combined the qualities of a nobleman, an army leader, a manager, and the socio-political conditions of the region which was led by Michael Vorontsov. The Caucasian Viceroy managed to form a reliable patronage network, which excluded the opposition and was the basis of the regional autocracy of the Viceroy. The administrative apparatus was made up of experienced officials who served with Vorontsov in the Novorossiysk region. Among the local population who supported the Viceroy was the Georgian princely clans, including the Orbeliani family, as well as the Armenian merchants. The formation of a loyal fraction was also necessary in the context of a confrontation with the Ministerial bureaucracy, whose ties with local institutions were suppressed or extremely formalized. Loyalty of clients was provided by promotions, awards and material prosperity. The system created by Vorontsov proved to be durable. His successors also relied in the capital on the Caucasian Committee and its Director, and within the Viceroyalty - on the same corporations and individuals who were patronized by the first Caucasian Viceroy.

AB In the practice of constitutional and legal regulation of interethnic relations, such basic concepts as "nation", "ethnos" are used. The understanding of their essence, the limits of the circle of subjects outlined by them, as well as their relationship to each other, may change in the course of constitutional development, especially in the context of updating the legal paradigm. The concept of "nation" is the subject of research in anthropology, sociology, political science, philosophy and history. Today, through the prism of special scientific knowledge, various, sometimes mutually exclusive, approaches to determining its essence have been developed within these branches. The complexity of defining a normative concept that would be used in the legal regulation of interethnic relations is due to the need to take into account the features of the legal system, the relationships between normative legal acts, the general concept of legal regulation, as well as the existing strategic goals and objectives of state national policy. The article discusses the main scientific approaches to the definition of the concept of "nation", analyzes the changes that the concept of "nation" has passed in the constitutional (state) law of the Russian state at different stages of its historical development. The dynamics of changes in the concept of "nation" in the constitutional acts of the Russian state is also shown in the tables (diagrams).

LA Russian
DT Article
DE public administration; state system; resilience; stability
AB The study of the quality of public policy and administration, which can be understood along different categories ranging from "efficiency" to "stability", is rightfully considered one of the most important tasks in the social sciences. However, despite the burgeoning literature devoted to assessing the functioning of state institutions, this research field still has serious substantive and methodological gaps.
   The article documents a number of difficulties that researchers face studying the quality of state policy and efficiency of state institutions, which range from terminological cacophony to the bias in scientific constructions that heavily depend on the current socio-political context. On the basis of the analysis of these difficulties, the authors come to the conclusion that it is necessary to re-interpret the problem of evaluating state policy and the functioning of state institutions as a problem of resilience and stability of socio-economic relations and political processes that take place in the modern polities, and, with the help of such reinterpretation, they elaborate provisions that set the framework for a conceptual model for assessing the resilience and stability of public policy and administration.
   The model proposed by the authors is designed to take into account factors that are usually ignored by other approaches to assessing "good" governance, in particular, the dynamics of social sentiments. The starting point of their theorizing is the hypothesis that the analysis of political and administrative activities in the public sector requires shifting the focus from the activities of governments to the state system, defined as part of the social order that agents of the political process deal with. The social order does not include only state institutions, normative regulations and projects implemented by governments, but also stable informal practices of state institutions, local self-government as well as societal rules that regulate the interaction of people.

AB The article examines the professional life of Ivan Sakharov, a vivid representative of what is known as "nonprofessional" direction in Russian historical science in the first half of the 19th century. He studied the history of Tula Province and actively collected and published the folklore of the Russian people.
   The author analyzes the intellectual atmosphere of the Russian provincial society in the 1820s and the social, political and spiritual factors that encouraged its citizens to study local history. The most significant ones were the 1812 Patriotic War and the publication of "The History of the Russian State" by N. Karamzin.
   The article highlights I. Sakharov's life experience and his personal traits as well as his worldview as an intellectual of non-aristocratic origin. The author shows how Sakharov's character influenced his research, his love for folklore and, finally, his publishing business.
   I. Sakharov exemplifies the characteristic mentality of "posad" people, a social group in the urban population of Russian province. Unlike the "raznochintsy" (people of non-noble origin) in the after-reform time who mostly shared revolutionary and democratic outlook whereas the "posad" people in the 1830s had conservative and nationalist views.

DT Article
DE millennials; generation; post-Soviet youth; Russian society; social and
   political modernization
AB The author, relying on V.V. Radacv's monograph "MillenniaLs: How Russian Society Changes", analyzes the distinctive features of the "millennial" generation, whose maturation period occurred in the 2000s. Using the example of Russian millennials, it is demonstrated that the widely known concept of the "Soviet common man" is gradually becoming outdated, which makes it crucial to develop alternative interpretational generation schemes. It is emphasized that at the turn of the millennium in Russia there was a significant social turning point, which led to the formation of a new, "different" generation of young people, very distinctive from their elder cohorts. Strong and weak social resources and individual personality traits that help adaptations to rapidly changing social conditions are considered. To compare the data of his own sociological studies with the results set forth in the book under review, the author reflects on the views and values of post-Soviet youth, its modernization potential, and the adaptive abilities. The correlation of modern and traditional components in the value systems of representatives from different young social groups is estimated. According to the author, when analyzing social changes caused by the arrival of new generations, it is necessary to take into account that post-Soviet youth as a social group is internally heterogeneous and consists of representatives of different - sometimes contrasting - subgroups, differing in their views, the volume of social capital, and the characteristics of socialization experience. It is concluded that in the future, under favorable external conditions, the domestic generation of millennials may become a force capable of real social and political modernization in Russian society.

DE New Confucianism; Buddhism of the human society; Neo-Taoism
AB This article presents a study of the main trends in the development of traditional Chinese philosophy in the XX-XXI centuries. The transformation of the ideas of Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, influenced by Western thought are shown. The reasons for this transformation are indicated. The analysis of the philosophy of "new Confucianism" is given, the stages of its formation are revealed. There is presented the exposition of the teachings of the key representatives of the new Confucianism represented by three generations of followers of the teachings of Confucius, who were influenced by Western philosophers, especially I. Kant, A. Bergson, M. Heidegger. The philosophy of "new Confucianism" is characterized as a doctrine that tries to combine the traditional values of the West and the East, material and spiritual. The transformation of the ideas of Buddhism is revealed in the context of the analysis of the main provisions of modern Buddhism. The causes of the movement for the renewal of Buddhism are shown. There are given the views of the main ideologists of the renewal Yan Wenhui (1837.1911), which called for democratizing Buddhist institutions, secularizing Buddhist education, using the achievements of Western culture, as well as his student Tai Xu (1894.1947), who put forward the idea of humanistic Buddhism. The content of the idea of Tai Xu about humanistic Buddhism, the essence of which is to improve a person's life in real reality, and not in future rebirth, as well as its need to serve the interests of society, is presented. The modernization of Taoism is shown in line with the general modernization of traditional Chinese philosophy, which focuses on humanistic values. It is shown that the modern development of the philosophy of Taoism affects all aspects of human life, both physiological and social. Particular emphasis is placed on the relationship between man and nature, man and society.

DT Article
DE biopolitics; polis; state; governance; Plato; Aristotle
AB The article attempts to explain the origins of modern biopolitics. Its purpose is to show that biopolitics as a technology for governing the state and society is the phenomenon as ancient as the Western tradition of the political thought itself. Focusing primarily on the "Politics" of Aristotle and Plato's dialogues "Politeia" and "The Laws", A.Yarkeev demonstrates that many of the political and philosophical categories of the ancient Greek thought of the classical period are essentially biopolitical in nature, and the very method of developing political arguments about how to govern polis, largely anticipates modern biopolitical theory and practice. In their political treatises, Plato and Aristotle do not just thoroughly consider all the central topics of biopolitics (sexual relations, marriage, childcare, health care, education, upbringing, security, etc.). For them these topics are crucial for discussing politics and the art of governance.
   The analysis of the classical texts of Aristotle and Plato on political art conducted by Yarkeev allows us to conclude that the origins of modern biopolitics lie in the ancient Greek concept of a human being as a "political animal". This view simultaneously lays the foundation for both politics and biopolitics, the constellation of which (their structural combination, semantic exchange and interaction) defines Western technology of power.

DE history of book printing in Rus'; Azbukovnik; David Zamaray; Moscow
   Print Yard; "Lithuanian press"; books
AB This article examines the Alphabet Book (Rus. Azbukovnik) by David Zamaray, a proofreader of the Moscow Print Yard in the 1620s. Relying on the existing lexicographic tradition, David Zamaray created a new type of Azbukovnik, one mostly related to his professional activity. Zamaray's Azbukovnik reflects the new vocabulary that came to Muscovite Russia with books of the so-called "Lithuanian press". The selection and fixation of this vocabulary in the new dictionary are determined by the lexicographer's individual approach. At the same time, the few remaining copies indicate not only the elitist nature of Zamaray's work, but are also characteristic of different periods in its creator's life. The late sixteenth century (1596) witnessed the publication of works by Lavrenty Zizany (including his Lexis) and saw the release of the so-called "concise" version of Zamaray's Azbukovnik. Al the time, he was still a monk at the monastery of St Anthony of Rome in Novgorod, the western boundary of Muscovite Russia. In the 1620s, Zamaray worked for the Moscow Print Yard; the interest of the Moscow authorities in the books of the Lithuanian press grew, and a new version of Zamaray's Azbukovnik was created. In the 1630s, the dictionary's creator was supposedly exiled due to the changes caused by the death of Patriarch Filaret and the approval of the final text of his lexicographic work, Each of these periods is reflected in Zamaray's Azbukovnik, Being at the centre of the ideological reforms initiated and suspended by Patriarch Filaret, Zamaray was forced to take into account the changing political situation in the Muscovite state, This author of the early modern period created a new type of Azbukovnik, one which not only pays tribute to tradition, but also shows more and more individual traits of the creator.

TI Siberian Private Reindeer Herders and the Market: The Case of Iamal
SO REGION
LA English
DT Article
AB Iamal is the largest reindeer husbandry region in the world in both reindeer and herders. Here the market of reindeer production existed and the growth of personal reindeer numbers continued throughout the Soviet period and the period of the post-Soviet economic crisis. Economic liberalization has lifted restrictions on private reindeer ownership and the resulting growth of private herds has led to overgrazing. The paper discusses the cultural, economic, and ecological role of private reindeer herding as well as its legal aspects. The ecological role is given emphasis in the context of Hardin's "tragedy of the commons" concept. It is demonstrated that private/personal reindeer herding has always been the main driver of local reindeer herding and currently it is much more efficient than post-sovkhoz reindeer herding. However, as authority over the pasturelands still officially belongs to the ineffective and stagnant successors of Soviet sovkhozes and the political will to change this situation is absent, grazing resources represent common-pool resources and a situation closely resembling the tragedy of the commons emerges. It is argued that this situation necessitates state intervention, and measures to mitigate this situation, proposed by the reindeer herders themselves, are sketched. Finally, a list of principles to be adopted in order to ensure the further development of private reindeer herding and the continuation of its positive cultural and economic role are proposed.

AB For years, observers have been warning of wars over sovereignty rights and resources in the Arctic as a result of climate change. This fear is exaggerated. There are currently no territorial conflicts, nor is there a battle over resources. The geophysical and climatic conditions also make war in the Arctic an unlikely prospect. However, the competition between the USA, China and Russia on the global political stage could also spill over into the Arctic. The alienation between Russia and the West is making it impossible to establish a common security architecture for all Arctic states. The USA and Russia are increasingly including the interface between the western Arctic Ocean and the northern Atlantic in their deterrence plans. And if Russia were to prevent ships from sailing through its coastal waters in the northern sea passage region and the USA were to insist on its right to passage, a situation similar to that in the South China Sea could arise in the Arctic Ocean.

AB Nikolai Ivanovich Veselovsky (1848-1918), a Russian orientalist and researcher of Central Asia, was without exaggeration an outstanding man: almost with the medieval scope of a polyhistor scientist, he managed to leave his mark in almost all areas of Oriental historical knowledge at that time. As often happens, the works of scientists of such a wide range, then sometimes obscured by the more capital and well-founded writings of followers, but their merits as discoverers should not be forgotten in any case. A brief overview of the Turkic and Persian manuscripts and documents of Nikolay Veselovsky in the Russian State Archive of Litearture and Art in Moscow presents monuments of the Kazakh historical epic of the 19th century, important historical documents of Khiva and Kokand (17th - 19th centuries), letters of Turkestan religious and political figures, as well as excerpts of Persian Medieval works on Geography and Islamic Creed.

DT Article
DE great terror; national operations; German operation; Kazakhstan;
   extrajudicial instances; xenophobia; ethnization of terror
AB The "national" operations of the NKVD during the Great Terror remain one of the hottest debates in Soviet history. The sharp gap between the Bolsheviks' previous national policy encourages historians to advance various explanations about what happened. Some scholars believe that "national" operations were based on an ethnization of the image of the enemy, and as a result, the ethnic aspect allegedly received a priority over the social aspect in the punitive policy of Stalinism. Other historians believe the main reason for the "national" operations of the NKVD was the authorities' desire to eliminate any ties of Soviet citizens with the "hostile capitalist environment." The article presents directives and internal statistics of the NKVD, found in the Central Archive of the FSB of the Russian Federation and previously unknown to researchers. The authors discuss the thesis of the ethnic component of the Great Terror, using the example of the "German" operation in Kazakhstan. The "national" operations were ambivalent. Under conditions of such "landscapes" as industry, transport, and the army, total terror was aimed at "nationals" with practically no selection of victims. However, in the countryside, in the "outback" of the USSR, in places of compact residences of "hostile" ethnic "contingents," the state security bodies actively selected their victims. Thus, in the Kazakh SSR, the Germans deported to Kazakhstan in 1931-1936 and who were extremely dissatisfied with their living conditions became the main target group of the "German" operation. Germans who voluntarily moved to Kazakhstan before 1917 suffered much less.

AB The article analyses the practices of motivating political decision making in modern anti-drug management. The authors point out that the drug use level in Russia is one of the actual indicators of political stability and effectiveness of the sociopolitical activity, an element of the political legitimating of power aimed at maintaining public order and security. The authors examine the specifics of the Russian anti-drug policy, the reasons for the strengthening of the public demand to the state for the development of policy measures for the prevention and control of drug abuse, with an emphasis on toughening the measures of responsibility for drug trafficking. The empirical analysis focuses on widespread anti-drug policy strategies for reducing drug use threats. The authors consider various types of the anti-drug policy: (1) repressive type with absolute intolerance and active state intervention in the drug situation, in which the most severe measures are applied, including the death penalty; (2) restrictive type against illicit drug market but without extreme measures; and (3.) liberal model aimed at harm reduction programs for drug users through the legalization of some drugs. Data show typical political strategies for responding to drug threats using in various countries: problematization of the situation, declaration of powerlessness, costs, disproving stories, and so on. The authors substantiate the ambivalence of the Russian anti-drug policy, which is due to the peculiarities of political actors' perception of public anti-drug discourse. The article analyzes the Russian case of the anti-drug strategy selected by the Federal Drug Control Service (FSKN) of Russia, abolished in 2016. The main characteristics of the strategy were alarmism and perception of the real drug problem as a confrontation of values between the Russian society and the international illicit drug market. FSKN of Russia immediately took a power course in the implementation of the state anti-drug policy. Reduction of the state anti-drug policy to the power struggle against drug trafficking has led to the reorganization of FSKN of Russia into a traditional security force unable to significantly influence the level of drug use, which is an indicator of the stability and effectiveness of the sociopolitical order, a certain element of the political legitimization of power designed to maintain public order and security.

AB The intensive development of science and technology challenges integrative and interdisciplinary research approaches. The hypothesis of NBIC convergence, which is gaining popularity, in the light of modern advances in the field of nano-, bio-, information and cognitive technologies seems more and more realistic. A special place among the interdisciplinary fields that have been actively developing in recent decades is occupied by neuro- and cognitive sciences. The biological uniqueness of the human mind imposes significant difficulties on the study of humans and society in the framework of the natural science paradigm. The most certainty in matters related to the interpretation of human cognitive abilities was achieved by the biolinguistic program, which states: linguistic competence is a speciesspecific dominant that determines the cognitive architecture of human identity. The approach to the study of language and thought that originated in the middle of the past century successfully fit into the neo-Darwinist trend, whose popularity grew along with the influence of evolutionary biology. Even then, the first attempts were made to create a theory of language as a theory of the evolution of a biological object, subject to the laws of heredity and variability. The history of this approach originates in the writings of Noam Chomsky and Eric Lenneberg, whose efforts contributed to the creation of an alternative to the functionalist views in cognitive sciences. The concept of Chomsky and his followers was based on the belief in the fundamental epistemological status of language competence inherent exclusively in the human species and realized through universal generative procedures. The principles of generative grammar were adopted not only by linguists and cognitive scientists, but also by neuroscientists, biologists, sociologists, IT specialists and philosophers. Once in the mainstream of around philosophical vanguard, the concept of a " universal language" quickly gained confidence and became the foundation of both cognitive research and research in the adjacent fields. However, the assumption underlying this concept, the sense of which in general reduces to the postulating of the mental neuro-linguistic factor mediating the combinatorial-symbolic and sensorimotor speech systems, cannot be accepted for a number of fundamental theoretical objections. The aim of this article is to demonstrate the impracticability of the theses of the biolinguistic program in the context of criticism of the generativistic model of cognition and to show that this view of the nature of language and thinking is epistemologically inconsistent and entails unsolvable logical and semantic contradictions, which, according to the authors, are critical for the concept of basic properties of language. The article also discusses alternative solutions to the problem of the relationship between language and thinking in the framework of generativistic epistemology.

AB The article explores the experience of the countries of the Eurasian Economic Union in the formation and implementation of the ideology of patriotism and the state policy of patriotic education. The context of nation-building processes is considered along with approaches to formulating a national idea and national (civic) identity. Particular attention is paid to the discourse of the authorities. Through a comparative political analysis, the general and special characteristics of the models introduced in the EAEU countries, constants and dominants of discursive practices are revealed. The argumentation of representatives of the top political leadership in their attitudes to the proposed guidelines and priorities of socio-political development through an appeal to the value component taking into account the relationship of internal and external dimensions is shown. It is emphasized the lack of demand for the ethnocentric model of patriotic discourse and the relevant practices of political actors due to the complex composition of the population of most countries of the Union and other internal and geopolitical circumstances. At the same time the commitment to constructive orientation, the absolutization of sovereignty, and the motivation and positions that impede the adoption of balanced integration decisions can be revealed. It is suggested that the national idea of Russia cannot be limited to patriotism and that its de-politicization and de-ideologization cannot be absolutized.

DT Article
DE culture; cultural space; architecture; space; picture of the world
AB The need to establish links between cultural space and architecture, as a way of its existence throughout the history of mankind determines the relevance of the study. The purpose of the paper is to analyze interaction and connection between cultural space and architecture in history, as well as to identify forms and methods of this connection from origin to modern times. The author presents the analysis of cultural space in modern cultural science, identifies basic structural components of cultural space: representations, meanings and values expressed in semiotic models and in the picture of the world; social relations and communications embodied in the system of social roles and attitudes; and activities that permeate all of the elements above, linking them together. Architecture is perceived as one of the ways of cultural space existence, which includes not only a model of the world, vertical and horizontal orientation in space, but also a way to express value attitudes through fixing value dominants in certain parts of a building or spaces. The study is to show that architecture acts as a way of self-identification of culture, society, social groups, individual subjects by defining their place in geographical space, the existence of external and internal spaces as a semiotic expression of "friend/foe" position. The author examines the role of different types of architectural structures, allowing fixing social hierarchy and political power in the cultural space of different eras. As a result, a connection between cultural space and architecture is established, act as the ways of forming and functioning in society throughout the history of human development.

   JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY SOCIOLOGY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE

DT Article
DE socialism; consciousness; bourgeois; virtues; ideology
AB The article attempts to answer the question: why did the citizens of the late USSR expect that a return to bourgeois virtues would not be a big problem? Why did the citizens of the late USSR assume that it would not be too difficult for a Soviet person to adopt "normal" bourgeois moral attitudes? In this regard, the author analyzes the official Soviet ideas about the moral qualities required from a person in a socialist society. The article justifies that, in terms of the totality of virtues, the objective differences between the ideal-typical socialist and bourgeois requirements for a person were not too great. One can see that bourgeois examples of moral behavior are multi-component combinations of virtues, most of which have exactly the same relation to the ideal-typical "bourgeois" as to the "socialist". In fact, it is recognized that the norms of bourgeois morality themselves may be higher than bourgeois practice and legislation. The fact that fight for communism was the main principle of communist morality did not mean rejecting bourgeois virtues, which look quite acceptable. It was necessary to abandon the economic basis (the domination of private property) and the political and ideological superstructure that distort these virtues. Thus, the differences between the bourgeois and socialist moral codes were mainly due to differences in their ideological "superstructure". This is confirmed by the analysis of such significant documents for assessing the official content of Soviet morality as the textbook Historical Materialism or The Moral Code of the Builder of Communism. All this has led to a relatively conflict-free transition from Soviet Russia to Capitalist Russia.

DE Brexit; student migration; internationalization; university policy
AB The article is made around the search for an answer to two questions: how Brexit affected the dynamics of the entry of students from the EU countries and what new opportunities it presents for the UK educational system in the future. The experience of internationalization in the United Kingdom has served as an example for many countries for many decades, and now they closely follow the changes that are taking place in its educational system under the influence of these phenomena. It is shown that there was a decrease in the number of applicants from the European Union and, conversely, the number of applicants to British universities from non-EU countries increased. Among other topics, the article also touches on issues related to the future of the Erasmus+ Program, changes in tuition fees for students from EU countries, and general problems of financing British universities. On the first question, it has been concluded that such changes do not cause serious concerns of the British government; rather, on the contrary, they reflect the new realities associated with the country's exit from the European Union and the implementation of the country's foreign policy orientation towards "Global Britain". This new doctrine focuses on the intensive trade, economic and political development of Britain's ties with the Commonwealth and the internationalization of higher education, which continues to be a priority. International students are one of the most significant elements of Britain's strength and economic well-being. The answer to the second question remains largely open. At present, the full consequences of the withdrawal from the European Union and their severity are not yet fully understood due to the continuation of the transition period until December 31, 2020. London and Brussels are currently agreeing on the final terms of future relations between the United Kingdom and the European Union. For the UK, the consequences of Brexit have been superimposed on the manifestation of a pandemic, the end of which is not yet predicted by WHO. The current situation has already sparked an active debate in Britain and beyond about the advantages and disadvantages of distance education, about the future of university campuses, about the risks and opportunities of new technologies for learning. Although Britain is one of the leaders in the field of international education, it, like other countries, is subject to external influences, the degree of which cannot be fully predicted at the present time. It remains to observe the dynamics of the situation.

DE magic; culture; ethnography; white magic; sociocultural universal
AB The actualization of sorcery in modern Russia is associated with public interest in the phenomenon during the period of sociopolitical instability and spiritual quest. The current sociocultural situation forms a new cultural niche, and, in this vein, the study of the phenomenon of witchcraft and magic is relevant. The article is based on the materials of the study "Features of Magic in the Modern Culture of Ossetians", conducted in January-March 2000 by the Department of Sociology of North Ossetian State University. The survey involved residents of the Republic of North Ossetia-Alania (N = 492). The respondents were ranked by age (two cohorts: "under 35 years old" and "over 35 years old"; the ranking is due to the difference in the mentality of generations who grew up in different socioeconomic and political conditions), gender, nationality, level of education, and occupation. Also, a group of nine experts took part in the study; it included coaches of "spiritual growth", " hereditary healers and sorcerers", healers, and fortune-tellers. The transcendental field of knowledge is equally attractive to one degree or another for representatives of all walks of life. Thus, the study showed that every second resident at least once a year used the services of persons involved in magic, and every fifth did this with a regularity of once a month. At the same time, 81% of respondents had higher education. Magic is presented as an expression of the deep interconnection of two cultural phenomena that have an existential meaning for a person: a form of life (as a game combining linguistic and non-linguistic spheres) and symbolism (as a universal code of culture). The media play a significant role in shaping the attitude of the population towards magic. A number of specialized programs on television and radio, websites and pages on the Internet, the abundance of literature on magic, occultism, healing, and esotericism, as well as touring magicians, sorcerers, witch doctors, fortunetellers, and all kinds of trainers on "spiritual growth and self-knowledge" do not leave indifferent a certain part of the population.

AB The paper is dedicated to particular cases of interaction and mutual impact of philosophy and cognitive science. Thus, philosophical preconditions in the middle of the 20th century shaped the newly born cognitive science as mainly based on conceptual and propositional representations and syntactical inference. Further developments towards neural networks and statistical representations did not change the prejudice much: many still believe that network models must be complemented with some extra tools that would account for proper human cognitive traits. I address some real implemented connectionist models that show how 'new associationism' of the neural network approach may not only surpass Humean limitations, but, as well, realistically explain abstraction, inference and prediction. Then I stay on Predictive Processing theories in a little more detail to demonstrate that sophisticated statistical tools applied to a biologically realist ontology may not only provide solutions to scientific problems or integrate different cognitive paradigms but propose some philosophical insights either. To conclude, I touch on a certain parallelism of Predictive Processing and philosophical inferentialism as presented by Robert Brandom.

To some degree this polarization of positions is because Wittgenstein himself provides neither what a rule is, nor what criteria allow us to determine what it means to follow a rule; and because it is clear what kinds of rule we are talking about when discussing the application of Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations in the theory and philosophy of law. But no matter how the positions of legal scholars were formed regarding the application of "later" Wittgenstein's ideas to the legal sphere, and no matter what strategy they followed, they are united by a common methodological motive-how to solve (elucidate and, if possible, eliminate) the so-called legal indeterminacy problem. The essence of this problem is reduced to the question of whether legal rules (legal norms) determine the result of a judicial decision (or other law enforcement) in each particular case. Legal formalists answer this question positively, since they believe that the task of a judge is to resolve judicial disputes by applying consistent principles to the facts in order to obtain a result. Legal anti-formalists, on the contrary, argue that legal rules and legal concepts (and law in general) are "radically indeterminate" because of the indeterminacy of the language itself. The idea about the "direct application" of Wittgenstein's thoughts to solve the legal indeterminacy problem caused criticism and heated debates. For example, the modern American legal philosopher Brian Bix sharply opposed it, who argued that Wittgenstein's ideas were not directly related to jurisprudence. Considering and analyzing the discussions and arguments of legal formalists and legal anti-formalists, Bix formulates his own philosophical position. He does not consider himself to be one of the opposing sides, but a careful consideration of his arguments shows that he rather adheres to the position of philosophical anti-realism, according to which formal procedures affect the interpretation of legal constructions that are often hypothetical in nature.

AB The Falkland Islands have a status of the British Overseas Territories, which they acquired after the collapse of the colonial system. This archipelago, which consists of more than 700 islands, has a strategic importance due to its location. The Falklands is home to the British Air Force and Navy. Since the 19th century, the islands have been the subject of a constant territorial dispute between the United Kingdom and Argentina, which defended its right to them both at the negotiating table and on the battlefield. The article studies the dynamics and content of Argentine-British relations regarding the "Falklands issue" and ways to normalize them. Both sides have repeatedly resorted to the system of international law to prove their positions. However, their territorial dispute has not been settled. The maintaining strong economic, political and cultural ties with the inhabitants of the archipelago, as well as the strengthening of their British identity, remains a key factor in the superiority of the United Kingdom over Argentina in the territorial dispute.

TI New Forms of Political Participation: Prospects for Newsgames

DT Article
DE newsgames; political participation; gamification; virtualization;
   network and streaming structures; social change
AB The article considers the phenomenon of newsgames as a new form of political participation and analyzes the prospects of their spread in Russia. Materials for the analysis are a secondary analysis of data presented in scientific publications, the author's research on the analysis of the dynamics of newsgames development in Russia, as well as materials of the research "Level, Quality, Fullness of Life - A New Index of Social Development", carried out by the Center for Sociological and Internet Research, Saint Petersburg State University, in March 2020. It is proved that newsgames represent a new form of political participation, since clicking on the "start game" button can be considered as participation in a specific voting organized by particular mass media on the issue of the problematic nature of news. Participation in the game is a variant of a non-public statement, expression of a personal position, it can be considered as an action that is performed by individual citizens intended to demonstrate their own mobilization. The features of newsgames as a form of political participation are determined by the specifics of their functioning environment (virtual environment) and the nature of the media (combination of news and game). Newsgames represent the trend of virtual political participation as opposed to its traditional forms, and they are also one of the manifestations of the gamification trend. This form of participation is one of the mechanisms that ensure the integration of individuals (at their wish) into the network and streaming structures of modern society, and at the same time act as a tool for latent mobilization and audience retention by the Internet media. The correspondence of newsgames to the forms of social organization of modern society - network and streaming structures - makes it possible to predict their potential demand in the nearest future. Newsgames, as a new form of news reporting, allows going beyond the boundaries of conventional informing, suggesting a gentle "recruitment" of individuals for the needs of modern capitalism and at the same time providing them with certain benefits. Despite the fact that Russian newsgames cannot be considered a significant form of political participation yet, they should still be taken into account when measuring and characterizing individuals' involvement in political networks and streams.

ID SATISFACTION
AB The twentieth century demonstrated the undoubted correctness of Marx's theory of alienation. Many of the problems he pointed out reached their climax at the end of the twentieth century and became the focus of attention when management realized them as an obstacle to development in the most innovative sectors of the economy. On the other hand, non-capitalist production showed similar dysfunctions associated with alienation. All this shows that alienation, which Marx considered a product of capitalism, is, on the whole, a property of the industrial system and the requirements that it makes to organizing labor, to the place and role of the actor in the production system. Post-industrial society is freed from alienation in labor due to new approaches to management and work motivation, agile transformations in particular. The article presents the results of a theoretical review of Marx's theory of alienation. The author analyzed the methods of overcoming alienation used in agile companies. The results of expert interviews are presented in the article. The informants were 11 experts in the field of agile transformations: heads of companies that have implemented agile transformations of large oil and gas enterprises, banks and a number of other large corporations; external consultants on setting up agile business processes in startups; agile coaches of IT companies working in-house. Based on the conducted expert interviews, the author demonstrates the ways a modern company, in the postindustrial era, changes its approach to management, overcoming the aspects of alienation Marx wrote about, but at the same time remains within the framework of the capitalist system and private ownership on the production means. Based on the results of the analysis of the interviews, the following methods of overcoming alienation modern companies use are distinguished: 1. Increasing teams' autonomy: instead of external control over the work process, agile companies practice setting high-level tasks for teams. Such practices collectively are a way to overcome alienation from the work process. 2. Teamwork on the project. In an agile company, the work unit is not an individual, but a team. The management model, built on the principle of teams' self-organization, implies constant communication, and team responsibility contributes to the development of mutual assistance and support. Thus, the alienation of people from each other in the production process is overcome. 3. Having a clear and shared work purpose. 4. Authorization of the result: it ceases to be anonymous due to the fact that instead of a structure with a team of functional departments, employees work in small groups on an autonomous product.

TI REPRESENTATION AFTER MODERNITY: FROM HEIDEGGER'S "OTHER BEGINNING" TO
   DERRIDA'S "SENDING"

DT Article
DE Martin Heidegger; Jacques Derrida; modernity; metaphysics;
   representation; universalism; other beginning; sending
AB The article deals with the relevance of the concept of representation for rethinking the project of modernity and its possible alternatives by Heidegger and Derrida. It is pointed out that the concept of representation is closely connected with the universalism of modernity as it is reputedly provided by metaphysics, since Heidegger's concept of ontological difference, e.g., the difference between Being and being that has become the token of metaphysics, proves to be an elementary model of representation. This makes it possible, in turn, to correlate representation as the substitution of one entity for another with mediation. In the issue, Heidegger's concept of the history of Being turns out to be the description of the sequence of its representations that depend on the respective type of mediation. The analysis proceeds from Heidegger's concepts of "clearing" (Lichtung) and "appropriating event" (Ereignis) that designate man's everyday coping with people and things based on habitual skills. It is these everyday practices that reveal people and things in "clearing" and render the understanding of Being possible. Therefore, the "appropriating event", implying a paradigm or style of revealing Being, elucidates Heidegger's idea of the other beginning of thinking. The first beginning, having given birth to representation, destined metaphysics as the pattern of going from the particular to the general for modeling universalism. However, according to Heidegger, the first beginning makes possible the other beginning that does not assume representation and mediation. In Derrida, the connection of modernity with representation is exposed in his critique of the "metaphysics of presence" which resulted in specifying representation as a "sending" (envoi). Derrida holds the opinion that it is not the difference of the origin of a system from the secondary entities, but its difference from itself is primordial. It implies that mediation and thereby representation prove to be primordial, whereas the immediacy of the origin seems impossible. Eventually the limitations of the type of universality that is inherent in modernity come into sight, and the binary "logic of identity" which was reputedly universal is opposed by the "logic of supplementarity". Thus, the comparative analysis juxtaposes Derrida's and Heidegger's modeling of representation, whereas their stances on representation and universalism after modernity turn out to be antithetical.

DE Dostoevsky; Rene Girard; triangle of desire; underground man; unhappy
   consciousness; diegetic narrator; existentialism
AB In the article, in the context of numerous literary-critical works by Rene Girard, the author considers Girard's reading of some texts by Fyodor Dostoevsky through the "triangle" of desire and pays special attention to Notes from Underground. According to the author's hypothesis, the text of Notes (especially the first part) cannot be fully and correctly understood through Girard's concept. And the obvious impossibility to include the text of Notes in the series of texts that verify the concept of the triangle of desire entails the lack of explanatory power of Girard's theory in relation to (some) Dostoevsky's works. To prove the stated hypothesis, the author offers his own reading of Notes through the use of various ways of "description": the schemas of narratology and the phenomenological approach (within the Hegelian problem of unhappy consciousness). In the first part of the article, the author sets out the main structural elements and the phenomenology of the triangular desire using examples of Dostoevsky's works and biography (presenting Girard's reading). In the second part, the author offers his own (inevitably limited) critical reading of Notes from Underground. In conclusion, the author analyzes the interested (erroneous) reading of Notes by Rene Girard.

Analysis of the events associated with the pandemic and its impact on the economies of leading countries and on the prospects for reducing greenhouse gas emissions is carried out. Article also focuses on the climate-related social movements, including "Fridays for Future" initiative and Flightshaming flashmobs. Analysis of the origin of these movements is carried out, with a special reference to the real goals and beneficiaries of this type of activity on the global level. A connection is traced between the origination of these movements and actual state of the global scientific discourse on the climate change issues, including the anthropogenic warming hypothesis. Special attention is paid to the reaction of the world and European elites political to the situation with coronavirus, including new and worrisome approaches. Attempts to counter the shift of the global agenda from the climate change issues to the real action against global coronavirus pandemic, carried out both at the EU level and at the global level, are discussed. New EU goals in the area of GHG emission reduction, set in the EU State of the Union address of September 16, 2020, are analyzed, in parallel with the assessment of the economic situation in the EU countries after the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic and the EU activities during that period.

ID EXISTENTIAL ANXIETY
AB The article considers the concept of integrity as a bioethical and, at the same time, cultural concept. Integrity is taken here not as an ontological or methodological principle, but as a cultural value, as a person's prior belief that they are whole. The concept of integrity in Western societies is used to protect the personal identity not only of individuals, but also in relation to humanity as a species. Concurrently, modern culture, in addition to increasing humanization, is characterized by an anthropological crisis. Reality is significantly at variance with the system of principles and ideals officially declared by society. The article raises the problem of preserving integrity as an inherent characteristic of personal and cultural identity and the existential consequences associated with ignoring this problem. Modern Europeans meets all basic needs, while the level of existential anxiety is very high. Existential anxiety is directly related to the awareness of the finiteness of being and is experienced as a disintegration and loss of integrity. In this regard, it becomes clear that the twentieth-century philosophy is interested in psychiatry, and psychiatry is interested in philosophy, since the sick mind is a mode of existential disintegration of the mind itself. In this sense, the existential-phenomenological tradition can be of interest for both bioethics and cultural studies, bringing out the experience of integrity and loss of it in its theoretical and practical entirety. Using the example of oncological diseases and mental pathologies, the authors show that human psychophysiological health can be caused by factors of noogenic origin. It is concluded that today there is a need for interdisciplinary research that problematizes such concepts as integrity and self-identity based on the synthesis of cultural studies, bioethics, philosophy, on the one hand, and medicine and natural science, on the other.

AB This article examines various aspects and foundations of the formation of a cynical subject and cynical lebenswelt as a result of the transition from a "disciplinary society" to a "society of control". The authors proceed from the thesis that strategies of behavior as conditions and methods of manipulating public consciousness depend on a meaningful understanding of the nature of social reality. Dynamic ways of explaining the nature of social reality contribute to a humanistic understanding of the creative and intellectual capabilities of a person as a social actor-subject. Based on the typology of "social action" by Max Weber, strategies of behavior are actualized in the field of motivational problems. Enriching the understanding of models of behavior with the ideas of Michel Foucault's "social technologization" and actor-network theory, two main social technologies characteristic of a "disciplinary society" are distinguished: technologies of authority and technologies of the self. Technologies of authority are based on the principles of dominance, influence and determination of individual behavior. However, in modern society, these technologies are not productive, without technologies of the self, without social actors, to effectively express themselves in the dynamic conditions of the social ethos. The interaction of technologies of authority and technologies of the self contributes to the transition to a "society of control" characteristic of the second half of the 20th century. The " society of control" led to the formation of formalized models of social behavior, to desacralization and deontologization of the meanings of social reality. As a result, the authors deduce an assumption about the development of modern social technologies as representations of cynical strategies of behavior. A cynical strategy of behavior is understood as a value-rational social action aimed at avoiding a holistic reality, slipping into superficially evaluative models of behavior, leading to procrastinatory algorithms for the interaction of the actor-subject with society. A "cynical lebenswelt" is formed, paralyzing the political and social will of people, giving rise to the phenomenon of an all-consuming mass-cultural referral. The cynical strategy of behavior as a refusal to search for one's self and for veridiction of truth and as satisfaction with formal ritualized practices is a marker trend in the development of modern society. The research uses the following methods: social typology by Weber, the concept of social technologization by Foucault, the ideas of the actor-network theory.

DE Civil war; status of women; memoirs; author; autobiographical heroine
AB The study addresses the memoirs of Natalia Sukhogorskaya "The memory of the Makhnovshchina" (1927) to restore the life of an ordinary woman under the power of Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine. In the Nestor Makhno's capital Huliaipole, autobiographical heroine immerses herself in the atmosphere filled with legends about Makhno. Thus the author generates two narrative tendencies: autobiographical and folkloric ones. The rumors nurture the autobiographical heroine's fears. From this perspective, author shows the identities of the heroine. The first of them - the motherhood - is not jeopardized under Makhno since he is friendly to children. The second is the refugee. Affiliation to the female sex also protects Sukhogorskaya under the rebels' sway. School as her job gives her an inviolable status. Her more vulnerable position is related to her identity as intelligentsia representative, seeing that the rebels didn't like this social stratum. The perspectives of author and autobiographical heroine are often intersecting, yet the paper proves able to clarify the author's functions who acts as a writer giving characteristics of internal movements of his personages. The author also appears as a historian who generalizes in hindsight and as a folklorist who records and reproduces oral stories, legends and rumors of the Civil war times. Fear for the life and the desire to survive become main motivators for the residents during the war, so that against this backdrop the author' s political views remain unclear.

ID RACE; BOUNDARIES
AB The article elaborates on the symbolic nature of ethnic borders. An ethnic border is a symbolic marker and a symbolic way of organizing social differences between groups. The article examines borders as a tool for the production of ethnic groups. The initial assumption is that, as soon as identity is an attitude but not a property, belonging to an ethnic group is a result of social organization, self-attribution, and determination by others. The production of borders serves to satisfy the basic needs of individuals for identification, both self- and external. Borders are built based on a commonly shared symbol. The choice of criteria for differentiation is determined by the context, and not by any "objective" differences. Ethnic borders are of "selective" and relative nature. An ethnic border becomes real and productive only when the differences on which it is based are perceived as significant and used by actors to explain social interactions. Ethnic borders are related to interactions and have a symbolic nature. Therefore, borders function and organize social practices between delimited groups. The overall mechanism of the construction of ethnic borders is as follows. First, any set of individuals can be divided according to characteristics that are meaningful and significantly different from another set of individuals. The border is built according to the criterion of content and significance. Second, these differences are objective, as they can be listed. At the same time, they are subjective as they will not play a significant differentiating role outside the given context and the perception by the actors. Third, borders are effective to the extent they impose on the perception of actors and the perception of others. Thus, the production of ethnic borders is a balance between perception and structural social activity. The consequences of ethnic distinction-ethnic categories-have significant consequences both at the individual level and at the organizational or social level.

AB The article is devoted to the European Union's single market of labor and capital. A critical approach is being set out with respect to the EU experience in this area (taking into account COVID-19) and the possibilities of its use today in the economy of the Russian Federation and the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). Certain Russian authors expected unstable and insufficiently favorable development of the economic and political situation abroad for many years, as well as the negative impact of this on the Russian economy in a number of works published by them 5-10 years ago. In particular, it is pointed out that the problems associated with free labor migration will aggravate in the face of deep economic.risis and adverse economic conditions. It is expected that such conditions will prevail in the European and Eurasian area in the near future. The advantages and the disadvantages of free migration of labor and capital are reviewed. In EAEU the freedom of mobility of the factors of production increased, however now the question is raised about the impact of.OVID-19 and economic crisis on the migration of factors of production (especially labor) as well as about the socio-economic reasons for the large-scale spread of coronavirus. The importance of studying these issues is emphasized. In today's circumstances the massive imports of labor in Russia is risky. Some alternative approaches are considered. The article touches upon many hot topics of world development, including de-globalization, the growth of centrifugal forces in the EU, Brexit.

AB The article examines the usage of the unofficial title 'White Tsar' in relation to the Russian tsar in sixteenth century Russia. Boris A. Uspenskii, Vadim V. Trepavlov and other scholars have established that the title was primarily used by the people coming to Russia from the East, and it was not until the eighteenth to the nineteenth centuries that the title started to circulate within the country. In the literature, there are mentions of the 'White Tsar' in earlier historical sources, for example, in 'The Tale about the Florentine Council' composed by Simeon Suzdalets'(circa 1447-1448), 'The Eulogy on Vasilii III' (circa 1533-1534), as well as in the accounts by Siegmund Herberstein and Giles Fletcher. The article refers to a previously unknown source, in which the 'White Tsar' is also mentioned - the colophon from the handwritten Octoechos of 1547 to 1548. It is shown that the origin of the title is unlikely to be associated with the Church or the political elite and is concluded that the term 'White Tsar' had originally come from book scribes, who constituted quite a large part of the Russian society in the sixteenth century, including white and black clergy and some categories of secular people.

DT Article
DE Poland; European Union; migration policy; legislation; regulation;
   immigration; labor market
AB The article analyzes the development of Poland's migration policy from the late 1980s until the present time. The transformation of this policy took place in direct proportion to socio-economic and political changes in the country. The first period was related to the beginning of a systemic transformation in Poland and understanding of the need for conceptual approaches to the problem of migration. During these years, the priorities of the migration policy were to ensure the country's security, as well as to facilitate the access of Poles to the international labor market. The next stage was characterized by preparations for Poland's accession to the EU. At this time, there was a gradual "Europeanization" of Polish law into which EU directives were implemented. Meanwhile, preliminary work began on the development of basic principles of the Poland's migration policy. In the third stage, these basic principles were harmonized with European legislation, with priority given to solving national problems, especially in the economy which began to experience a shortage of labor. A number of EU directives concerning labor migrants were implemented in Polish legislation. There was also some liberalization of the access to the Polish labor market for foreigners from third countries - the citizens of six post-Soviet states: Belarus, Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, Armenia and Georgia. During this period, there were changes in the policy of repatriation of ethnic Poles living outside the country. The fourth period includes ongoing changes related to the response to domestic challenges. The further evolution of the Poland's migration policy and its format are largely determined by such factors as intensification of a negative demographic trend, the direct result of which is an acute shortage of labor and, therefore, high demand for foreign labor, that is growth in labor migration. The answer to these challenges is the development of a new migration strategy.

AB The article considers the phenomenon of European-Chinese cooperation in the context of the transformation of Eurasia as an international region. Particular attention is paid to the development of China's relations with the countries of Eastern and Central Europe and the Western Balkans; the features of China's interaction with the countries of Southern Europe are revealed. The paper provides an analysis of factors influencing the correlation and struggle between new trends in the process of the innovation space formation in Eurasia. The role of Europe and China in the development of new transit routes across and around Eurasia is being studied. Its features include a combination of land and sea routes. Europe and China are synergistic within financial, industrial, and e-commerce complementarities. The article investigates the role of Chinese trade and investment in Europe with a particular focus on intensity of the latter toward the industrial heart of Europe: Germany and the Visegrad 4 countries. It highlights the German-Central-Eastern European Manufacturing Core as one of the most competitive industrial bases of Sino-European cooperation. Deepening Sino-European ties across Eurasia, leveraged by new technologies, give the continent integrity in global geo-economic terms. The paper assesses the current evolution of EU - China relations, which expanded greatly in geographic terms and diversity. The article seeks to explain that the interaction between China and Europe has social, economic, and even political dimensions, with potentially long-term implications for the structure of world affairs. Europe and China are the largest entities in Eurasia and in the international system, apart from the United States. The authors conclude that Sino-European reunification is contributing to a new phase in the transformation of Eurasia and to its rising significance in global political and economic governance.

DE David Hume; religious-philosophical ideas; Soviet historiography
AB The article overviews some of the basic provisions of the Soviet historiography of Hume's religious-philosophical ideas. The subject of the article is the historical-philosophical reflection of famous national specialists and researchers - S.F. Vasiliev, A.F. Gryaznov, B.V. Meerovsky, Yu.P. Mikhalenko, I.S. Narsky, N.E. Ovander. The aim of the article was to identify the main characteristics of Hume's religious-philosophical ideas found in the Soviet formational-evolutionist specialized historiography. As a result, the following was stated. Firstly, Soviet specialists and researchers focused on comprehending those Hume's religious-philosophical ideas, which showed the originality of his skepticism, the originality of his attitude towards materialism and deism. Secondly, they were inclined to see in Hume a philosopher who was rather critical of religion. Thirdly, they often drew attention to the duality and contradictions of Hume's religious-philosophical ideas. The article is provided with a body of reference in the form of personalities, bibliographic articles, and a dictionary entry.

DE value; artifact; axiology of technology; value-neutrality thesis;
   artificial intelligence; theory of value embedding
AB The article shows that the value-neutrality thesis contains contradictions and cannot be used in the practice of humanitarian assessment of technology. The theory of value embedding is analyzed. The conclusion that this approach does not explain the possibility of using technical objects to implement values that were not anticipated by the developers and does not disclose the process of " embedding" values has been made. It is shown that the concept of value embedding cannot be used as the basis for a humanitarian assessment of technologies. The attribution of values to the technical objects themselves, which we can find in various concepts of ethical artificial intelligence, is not fully justified and can lead to serious negative social and humanitarian consequences. At the same time, due to their physical organization and functional orientation, technical objects construct many types of human activity, and make some of them possible. Therefore, they can indirectly influence the implementation of certain values, and this must be taken into account in the practice of regulating the use of these objects. The problems of the humanitarian assessment and forecasting of the possible directions of the implementation of values during the implementation of technologies were developed in the 20th century in international law when assessing various types of weapons. The analysis shows that under the current conditions it is advisable to use such approaches in relation to artificial intelligence systems that can cause serious humanitarian and social transformations. At the same time, in the field of intelligent systems, the practice of facilitated legal regulation based on the theory of value embedding is being actively promoted. The functions of axiological and ethical assessment in such cases are in fact transferred from experts to developers of these technologies. In these conditions, it is important that specialists in the field of philosophy of technology, axiology, ethics actively speak out in the public space on these issues.

AB The article is devoted to the 200th anniversary of the discovery of Antarctica under the guidance of 2nd rank captain F. Bellingshausen and lieutenant M. Lazarev. Analyzing the peculiarities of Antarctica, the author notes that this is one of. few regions of our planet, the resources and territory of which are used by various states jointly and exclusively for peaceful purposes for the benefit of science. The article analyzes in detail the celebration of this anniversary in Russia and foreign countries, while paying special attention to the thematic focus of socio-political and scientific events. Considerable attention is paid to the study of the region by Russia and the European states. Interstate cooperation between countries in Antarctica is aimed at finding effective solutions to global problems facing humanity, such as environmental pollution, climate change and its consequences, and the loss of components of biological diversity. It is concluded that despite the fact that Antarctica is traditionally one of the strategic regions for the national interests and security of our state, Russia does not always respond promptly to the existing challenges and does not pay necessary attention to improving the research base and living conditions of polar explorers.

TI Ideology and Discourse in Contemporary Social Sciences and the
   Humanities and the Role of Sociology in their Conceptualization
SO AMERICAN SOCIOLOGIST
LA English
DT Article
DE Ideology; Discourse; Bibliometrics; Concept analysis
ID EDUCATION
AB Discourse and ideology are interrelated concepts in social sciences and the humanities and are even occasionally employed interchangeably. This paper sheds light on their relationship in academic discourse and examines the role of sociology as a scientific field in its conceptualization. Using bibliometric analysis, we examined 15,716 academic publications mentioning "discourse" or "ideology" in their title and written in English by American and British scholars between 1966 and 2015. The investigation focused on the two terms' conceptual environment, areas of usage, journals, and the organizations to which the authors were affiliated. First, we conclude that although some sociology researchers have attempted to create a sociological definition for the concept of discourse, sociologists are not its most active users. The same is true for ideology. These concepts have established niches in other disciplines (political science and history for "ideology," and educational science and linguistics for "discourse"). Second, throughout the years, the field of discourse studies has become more diversified and fragmented than that of ideology. Third, the leading organizations in both fields are prestigious American and British universities, which indicates that discourse and ideology are elements of the intellectual elites' language. Fourth, the concept of discourse was more frequently applied than that of ideology in the years 2010-2015, and we expect that it will remain popular among scholars in the next decade. As for ideology, we believe that new social challenges could foster the rediscovery of this concept in the near future.

DT Article
DE Nikolai Klyuev; Lamennais; Poetry; Christian socialism
AB This paper analyzes the early poetry of Nikolai Klyuev-its social and political motives are studied in the context of the poet's biography and in terms of the essay Modern Slavery, written by Hugues-Felicite Robert de Lamennais, the French Catholic philosopher and forerunner of social Christianity. This paper identifies two stages in Klyuev's assimilation of the philosophy of social Christianity. Klyuev's poetry initially reproduced the main message of Lamennais's essay-the rejection of "slavery" as a "heritage" by recognizing the human dignity of "today's slave" and rebelling against the existing socio-historical tradition. In the second stage, the most important categories of Lamennais's works-brotherhood, cooperation and sacrifice-find their full meaning in Klyuev's poems. Work "for brethren's sake" becomes a form of co-operation with God, while experiencing severities and hardships on the revolutionary path is a form of spiritual co-crucifixion with Christ.

AB The article is devoted to a pioneer comparative study of the appearance and evolution of people's houses in Western Europe and Russia in the second half of the XIX - early XX century. The institutional approach chosen by the authors is complemented by a historical and comparative method of studying the phenomenon of people's houses. The goals of their creation and features of the activity, due to the political, economic and sociocultural historical realities of individual countries, are analyzed. Research revealed that people's houses in Europe and in Russia were created at the same historical period - the modern era. A historiographical comparative study using new historical sources showed that in Western European countries and in the Russian Empire, the state did not play a major role in this matter, although some of the people's houses were opened by monarchs, and state policy (opposing promotion of cultural leisure to the alcoholization of the population) could contribute to the development of civil society initiatives. The performed study proves that for both European countries and Russia, private and public initiatives in establishing people's houses (primarily the cooperative movement) played a decisive role. In Russia, it is important to point out the sociocultural policy of the zemstvos, their financial support when building people's houses. The article shows the obvious differences in the history of people's houses in Western European countries and in Russia, due to the late formation of the party system in Imperial Russia. In Europe, one can meet many examples of the creation of people's houses by political parties and generally note the high level of politicization of these institutions. In Russian reality non-political nature of people's houses is obvious, they were mostly cultural and educational public institutions that were further subjected to the process of politicization (under revolutionary conditions). In conclusion, the authors acknowledge big historical significance of people's houses as civil society institutions in Russia and abroad, taking into account such principles of their functioning as independence, voluntariness, social activism and civic consciousness.

AB The withdrawal of the United States from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF Treaty) in 2019 threatens the collapse of the entire nuclear weapons control system created over the past 50 years. This may lead to an uncontrolled multilateral arms race. This dangerous turn of events is assessed differently by politicians and experts. One of the growing trends of thought postulates that the bipolar world of the Cold War times has given way to multipolarity, and therefore bilateral limitation of nuclear weapons is no longer possible. This premise is complemented by the hypothesis that the latest weapons and military technologies cannot be limited by the old methods of negotiations and agreements, which therefore should also be abolished. It is proposed to focus on the organization of various multilateral forums to create an enabling environment for strengthening nuclear deterrence, transparency, and predictability. However, scientific analysis shows that both of these premises are unfounded. First, despite deep reductions in nuclear weapons over the past 30 years, the share of the two leading powers in the global arsenal of such weapons has barely decreased, and the nuclear landscape remains largely bilateral. Second, the revolutionizing impact of advances in military technology is not new but a common occurrence that has recurred regularly throughout history. The experience of the past five decades has convincingly demonstrated that arms control can be successfully implemented if there is political will at the highest state level to reach agreements on the limitation and reduction of nuclear weapons.

AB The present article continues the research about the role of the ethnic factor in Red Army recruitment during the Great Patriotic War, the first part of which was published in RUDN Journal of Russian History 19, no. 2 (May 2020). This time the focus is on admission restrictions and prohibitions for certain Soviet ethnic groups, as well as on purges from the army due to soldiers' nationality. The contribution analyzes the major causes and the scale of this phenomenon, as well as the regulatory framework of restrictions and prohibitions and their development during the war. It is established that the reason for such restrictions could be political motives (distrust towards citizens on ethnic grounds), but also the ethno-cultural and linguistic features of conscripts coming from certain nationalities, with the idea that these features prevented their full use in military service. The article analyzes the practice of restrictions on ethnic grounds, including cases when military authorities in the field allowed for significant deviations from the regulatory framework. The scientific novelty of the present research consists in the fact that for the first time the ethnonational aspect of the history of the Red Army during the Great Patriotic War is analyzed with quantitative methods, which made it possible to significantly deepen our understanding of ethnic processes in the Soviet armed forces.

DT Article
DE Plato; Aristotle; theory of kingship; democracy; oligarchy; absolute
   monarchy; Hellenistic kings
AB The article deals with the question of the influence of Greek philosophy on the formation of Hellenistic monarchies. According to one point of view, theories of Greek philosophers on kingship played an important role in the formation of absolutism in the Hellenistic monarchies. It is believed that it is in the classical Greek philosophy that the ideas on absolute monarchy as the best state structure and on the legal rights of an outstanding person to royal power were developed. In the course of the study, the author infers that Greek philosophy did not have a significant impact on the formation of absolutism in Hellenistic monarchies. The Greek philosophers' doctrines of kingship were significantly different from the type of power that was characteristic of the Hellenistic monarchies. Leading political philosophers of the IV century BC Plato and Aristotle were supporters of two types of monarchy: a moderate monarchy in which the royal power is limited by law and an absolute monarchy based on the exceptional virtue of the king. In the Hellenistic monarchies, the unlimited power of the king was originally associated with military-political power. At the same time, the author finds that Greek philosophy had an indirect influence on the formation of absolute monarchies in the period of early Hellenism. This influence consisted in the fact that Greek philosophers criticized the sociopolitical system of Greece and the main types of polity of the state - democracy and oligarchy. Plato and Aristotle sharply criticized extreme forms of oligarchy and democracy in their works. At the same time, as the author has established, philosophers were supporters of moderate democracy and oligarchy. The sophists, the cynics and the Cyrenaics also actively criticized the values and traditions of polis. Thus, Greek philosophers unwittingly contributed to the weakening of the polis and the formation of absolute monarchies. The author has also found that Greek philosophers influenced the formation of the enlightened character of the rule of individual Hellenistic kings. Philosophers contributed to the upbringing of high moral qualities in the Hellenistic kings. This influence was especially evident in Alexander the Great, Ptolemy I Soter, Ptolemy II Philadelphus and Antigonus II Gonatas. In the final part of the article, the author comes to the conclusion that the main role in the formation of absolute monarchies in the period of early Hellenism was played by the ancient Eastern political traditions, as well as by the nature of the formation of Hellenistic kingdoms and their ethnic composition.

AB The article is devoted to the reconstruction of the socio-political resonance among the ruling elite of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, caused by the emergence in Poland of False Dmitry I. the Reconstruction based on the letters of members of the Senate to king Sigismund III, written in response to his question about how to deal with a man calling himself the son of Ivan The Terrible and heir to the Moscow throne. The second part of the study is based on instructions given by the gentry of the various States of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth to deputies sent to the Sejm in Warsaw, which was to be held in January 1605. There were heated discussions about the campaign of False Dmitry I to Moscow, so these instructions are also a valuable historical source. The letters of Polish senators cited in this article were previously briefly mentioned in studies on the Time of Troubles. They are currently stored in the manuscript Department of the Kurnick library of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Among them are letters from Chancellor Y. Zamoyski, Lithuanian Hetman Y. Khodkiewicz, Krakow castellan Y. Ostrozhski, poznan castellan Y. Ostrorog, Bratslav podkomor L. Piaseczynski, poznan Bishop L. Goslicki, Plock voivode S. Krasinski and Sandomierz castellan S. Tarnowski. This article presents for the first time in full the translations of fragments of these letters concerning False Dmitry I, since their brief analysis in the historical literature did not reflect the fullness of the emotions and feelings of the Polish ruling elite regarding this issue. As a result of full acquaintance with the sources, we came to the conclusion that the full Polish Senate was against the extradition of the impostor to the Moscow state, and among them was also the Chancellor Y. Zamoyski. Opinions differed as to the future of the "Prince," but they were also very cautious and did not call for his immediate support from the king and the Republic.

AB The article explores the religious ideas of the Saami. Since ancient times the Saami have been considered the most powerful and skilled sorcerers in Europe. The researchers note the special richness and complexity of Sami paganism. Under the pressure from Scandinavian Germanic tribes and Slavs, this small and peaceful people was gradually pushed back to the northern part of Scandinavia and the Kola Peninsula. In the 14th - 15th centuries, the Saami were subjected to Christian missionary work by the Swedes, the Norwegians and the Russians. Some of the Saami adopted Christianity, while the pagan ideas of the others were influenced by Christianity. Under Soviet rule, the Saami were subjected to mass migrations, political repression and forced atheization. Positive changes in the life of the Saami occurred during perestroika, in the late 1980s and 90s. At that time, there was a rise in national and civil consciousness. Perestroika in Russia coincided with the rise of the national Saami movement in the Scandinavian countries. At last, the Nordic countries went for the organization of Saami elected bodies - parliaments, democratically defending Saami interests. These "parliaments" actually have only consultative rights and no real political powers. Perestroika opened up state borders and the Kola Saami began to receive not only humanitarian aid from neighbouring countries, but also their enthusiasm for national revival. Public activists, scientists, journalists and artists came from Norway, Finland and Sweden. On this national wave there is also a religious revival of pagan beliefs. The leader of the Saami Parliament, Valentina Sovkina, plays a leading role in the national movement and in the revival of paganism. The Saami movement has found itself in a confrontation with the Murmansk provincial authorities, but with the beginning of the Governorate of Andrei Chibis, a tendency towards constructive interaction has been outlined.

AB This article addresses the political effects which the multidirectional activity of both the state and civil society institutions have on the voluntary movement. The state seeks to provide support with the purpose of indoctrination, whereas the aim of public organizations is civic activism. The authors of this paper confirm the hypothesis about the direct political impact of these efforts using the evidence of an empirical study of voluntary movements that was conducted in 2019 in the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug-Yugra. The authors conclude that just as state support provided to voluntary organizations does not incite the 'pro-government' discourse of their actions, so their 'civil' origin does not stir up oppositionist attitudes. Moreover, the state's efforts to indoctrinate or block political socialization can trigger the opposite response, where volunteers start to act opportunistically and non-profit public organizations, designed to be the mainstay of civil society, can easily be transformed into agents of state policy.

AB The article addresses the technological base development for the exploration and use of outer space over the current decade and the subsequent period. Primary attention is given to the USA, Russia and China. The most important disruptive emerging military and dual-use technologies are highlighted, their impact on strategic stability, national and international security is examined in terms of both opportunities and risks. A cluster of the most important and perspective space technologies is considered. The paper indicates the possibility and necessity of new agreements on exploration and use of outer space, crucial for adapting space activities to new military-strategic, military political and technological realities against a backdrop of the innovative technological breakthroughs and the digitalization processes development. Under the conditions of the U.S. military-political leaders' commitment to competition between great powers, special attentions are paid to the increase of the competition complex factor and development of the so-called PEMT-competition (political, economic, military and technological competition). One of its important focuses is the space activity. It is underlined in the perspective survey till 2040 that, in spite of the crisis situation in the Russian space sector at the boundary of the third decade of the 21st century, Russia has a real opportunity to remain in the category of leading space powers. Special case study of the article is the interactions between space development and strategic stability, on the one hand, and information warfare, on the other. The problems of the space systems vulnerability are also noted. The article emphasizes the fundamental nature, importance and necessity of an impending long-term revision of future global space activities, primarily from the perspective of strategic stability. But the necessity of intensive world discussions on space control is also stressed.

DT Article
DE Russia; modern society; society of the "late-take off"; modernization;
   industrial revolution; industrial society; deerent-stadiality of world
   development; October Revolution; bipolar world
AB Russia is regarded as a "late take-or society (other participants in this "cohort" - Germany, Japan, Italy), the modernization of which was guided from above, by the state and its agencies, indirectly reflecting the lack of alternative, spontaneous modernization option. The author, while exploring the phenomenon of modern Russian society in the unity of historical, economic, sociocultural and political forms of existence, tries to identify the similarities as well as differences between the domestic society, on the one hand, and the "classical" West, that is Northwest Europe, on the other. The comparison demonstrates: Russia is the most complex organism among the "late take-of'societies, in the modernization of which the state has played and continues to play a pivotal role in its various historical and political forms and manifestations. The paper outlines the main stages of the "guided" transformation of Russian society. Fundamental to the modernization of Russia were: Peter and Catherine's societal transformations, the first industrial revolution in the country (1850-1890s), emergence of the "organized capitalism" system in Germany, Japan, and later in the USA, the October Revolution, World War II, Soviet-American bipolarity. The accelerated transition of Russia from rural to industrial society was accompanied by deformations (deviationsfrom the West European "standard"), return movements ("counter-reforms'), and impediments to reception of representative institutions and practices by the masses. External pressure reinforced the tendency of state domination over society, which subsequently transformed into paternalistic behavior patterns. Migration flows were not accompanied by social and professional diversification of Russian society. From now on, the logic of the accelerated development of Russia was shaped by competition with the West that was undergoing the industrial revolution. This competition endangered the homeostatic equilibrium of traditional society. The World War I revealed the peripheral, subordinate position of Russia in the international system. The most radical approach to regaining a major power status in world politics was proposed by the Bolshevik Party, who led the October Revolution of 1917. The Communist model has become instrumental of advancing transformation of traditional/rural society into a modern, urban one. Subsequently, the exhaustion of the communist model's internal resources gave rise to a painful search for a new modernization and development paradigm. Currently, Russia's existential task is to accelerate the pace of economic growth, help society enter the trajectory of sustainable development and, consequentially, participate in the world system on the basis of "strategic autonomy" that is unconditional sovereignty.

DT Article
DE Iran; global oil market; sanctions; foreign investment; technological
   level; buyback contracts; new type of oil contract; United States;
   European Union; China
AB Iran is the world's fourth largest holder of oil reserves, and the costs of producing Iranian oil are relatively low. The dynamics of oil production has a pronounced cyclical character, and these cycles are set by political factors exogenous for the oil sector. The peak was reached in 1974, and since then Iran's share in world oil production has declined. The authors show that, in a series of powerful exogenous shocks, unilateral and multilateral sanctions have had a strong negative impact on the dynamics of Iranian oil production. The long-term negative effects of the sanctions significantly outweigh the short-term ones. Crucially, owing to the sanctions, the technological level of the Iranian oil sector remains extremely low. Global energy companies and banks refuse to cooperate with Iranian counterparties because the expanding practice of extraterritorial application of US sanctions has turned Iranian hydrocarbons into a "toxic asset." The countries of the Asia-Pacific region that continue to import Iranian oil under the sanctions have become able to establish favorable terms of contracts. Iranian oil is purchased at a price discount for restricted and/or nonconvertible currencies, often in exchange for counterbarter deliveries of goods. With the accelerating race to monetize hydrocarbon reserves and the approaching global peak in oil demand, it is more likely that a significant portion of commercially competitive Iranian oil will remain in the ground.

DE evil; freedom; good; apostasy; life; eschatology; immortality
AB The relevance of the presented research is determined by the fact that eschatological presentiments in Russian religious and philosophical thought reveal the future of the problem of good and evil. Eschatological problems investigated in the context of religious and philosophical discourse contribute to a more in-depth analysis of the ontological causes of social conflicts, violence phenomena, as these problems draw our attention to the spiritual and moral phenomenon of apostasy. The church legal concept and definition of apostasy, too focused on external anti-clerical forms of apostasy (accentuated on its external features), does not give a complete picture and does not reveal the full depth and multi-dimensionality of this phenomenon. The phenomenon of apostasy, if it is not reduced only to the manifestations of the church legal historical reality and signs that qualify the rejection of faith, is a deep and multifaceted phenomenon of spiritual and moral life of the individual, which has a direct impact on culture and society. Existing in the context of Judeo-Christian discourse, it can be characterized not only by external and internal apostasy from the faith and the church. It often becomes a dangerous and hypocritical form of apostasy and from all existential good, love, humanity as a whole, that is, acquires a certain global significance. The article considers the sources of the Russian religious and philosophical tradition, which reveal the problem identified in the title of the article in the context of apostasy as a phenomenon of apostasy from the value foundations of spiritual and existential goodness. The general directions in approaches of Russian religious philosophers to the theme of eschatology are revealed. The aim of the work is to show the importance and relevance of spiritual and moral issues, the choice of good and evil to deepen the modern philosophical discourse in the direction of prevention of interreligious, public and social conflicts, violence, extremism, and terrorism. Russian religious and philosophical thought came to understand the insolubility of the problem of evil, only in the context of the church ascetic worldview, but thoroughly confirmed the need and importance of spiritual and moral life. The eschatological direction of Russian religious and philosophical thought mainly correlates with the Eastern Christian cultural tradition and focuses on understanding the universal problems of the fate of the world and man, salvation and death, life and death, good and evil. Being outside the church legal and religious philosophical understanding, this phenomenon has acquired large-scale development prospects, rebelling on the spiritual and moral foundations of human life. It has become not only an external, but also internal characteristic of a person. This is confirmed by the extraordinary development of the phenomena of violence, extremism, and terrorism. But the movement of apostasy towards the peak of its development is not yet complete. These processes again turn our attention not to the external forms of apostasy, but to its deep essence. Hence the need arises to transfer the analysis of apostasy from the field of the church legal, cultural historical, and prophetic to the field of the spiritual moral, ethical.

AB Introduction. In the processes of nation building and integration, it is particularly important to increase the consolidation potential of emerging communities through identity politics. The totality of challenges, threats and risks determines the need for a balanced combination of its dimensions, taking into account national and common interests of countries. In the post-Soviet space, the Union State of Belarus and Russia acts as a platform for dialogue. The aim of the study is to outline the contours of the construct of supranational identity within the framework of the Union State and to define the degree of its conjugation with the category of "national identity. in the discursive practices of the political leadership of Russia and Belarus.
   Materials and Methods. The study is based on official documents representing the specifics of interpretation of identity politics by the presidents of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus, as well as on materials associated with the functioning of the Union State. Content analysis, the comparative method, and scenario analysis were employed when examining the documents.
   Results. The research and expert assessments of the internal and external dimensions of the identity politics of the member states, as well as the basic and derived categories of the official discourse have been analyzed; the constants and dominants, similarities and differences in the stands of Russia and Belarus have been revealed. It has also been demonstrated that there has been no fundamental contradiction in their understanding of the priorities of nation and Union building. At the same time, disagreements on a number of topical issues have been identified. The leitmotif of the official discourse is giving absolute priority to sovereignty, which has an ambiguous effect on the course of the integration of Russia and Belarus.
   Discussion and Conclusion. The conducted study has confirmed the hypothesis that identity politics is multilevel for the states involved in integration-oriented interaction; at the current stage, it remains complex and incomplete. The states demonstrate prevalence of the internal dimension of identity politics and "restrictive. perception of its external dimension, which affects the prospects for promoting the construct of "dual. identity. At the same time, the Union State remains an essential integration format for Russia from the geopolitical and civilizational perspective. The approach proposed by the authors and the results obtained, which articulate the correlation of tasks in terms of nation building and integration policy, may help to improve the efficiency of political governance.

DE partnership; social sphere; institutions
AB The article analyzes the purposeful development of inter-sector partnership in Russian contemporary social sphere. The author identifies the relevant framework of the term "social partnership", analyzes transformation of relevant practices for institutional interaction in Russia, makes a brief review of relevant empirical material and history of the term "social partnership". The author notes that the terminological apparatus and institutional practices of social partnership have overstepped the boundaries of the labor field and started to change since the middle of the 1990s. The analysis of the inter- sector social partnership rating of the regions shows that there have been necessary legal norms and real relevant practices in all the territories of the Russian Federation by 2018. The current period of inter-sector social partnership development is marked as its institutional fixation in Russian society on federal, regional, and municipal levels. The state is the main system-creating partner in the social sphere. Civil society representatives are the main partners of the state in the social sphere. Partners from the society receive state and municipal subsidies for their social projects annually. Partners from the state perfect the system of financial grant support for socially oriented NGOs, increasing its amount steadily. Development trends in the partnership interaction of the "business-society" type is observed. The imperfection of the regional legislation and methodological lacunae in budgeting partner projects are among factors limiting inter-sector social partnership. NGO representatives' participation in working out legal norms of inter-sector social partnership requires additional research. The boundaries of the contemporary term "partnership in the social sphere" are formed by the framework of intersector social partnership and determined by corresponding forms of interaction. The diversity of the forms is determined by active legal norms. The transformation of institutional interaction in the contemporary Russian social sphere is aimed at increasing the number of interacting parts, at polymorphism, at segmentation of social service providers and beneficiaries. The priorities of a social state remain the main ones for Russian partners in the social sphere in 2020. The leading principles for social partners are constructive interaction on the basis of active legal norms, of pooling values, goals, and resources.

DT Article
DE Gerrymandering; U.S. electoral system; electoral districts; Congress
   elections; electoral geography; polarization; Republican Party;
   Democratic party; U.S. House of Representatives
AB The paper conducts a comprehensive study of gerrymandering. First, the author describes the regulation of the redistricting process in the United States, focusing on the methods to limit partisan influence. Any commission but independent would still provide some space for gerrymandering. Even bipartisan control is not enough, as the parties would be willing to gerrymander with compromise, thus lowering competition. Looking for a method to measure gerrymandering, the author studies scholarship on the issue, specifically approaches to fairness and competition of elections. It is concluded that any method of redistricting is flawed, and thus any decision on congressional districts will have political consequences, changing the balance in favor of one of the parties. Next, the paper provides the 2018 election data to illustrate the features of the U.S. electoral geography and explains the complexity of competition between the parties. Polarization leads to clustering of partisan supporters, which naturally diminishes the competition, making the system less responsive. Ongoing demographic trends form a distribution of voters that is easier to gerrymander to advantage the Republican Party. The author considers this one of the two reasons why the Democratic Party has been advocating for independent commissions and court-ruled maps. The second reason is that this party was the victim of well-planned gerrymandering in 2011. Both sides now have entities to coordinate efforts on state elections campaigns and win seats to control redistricting, as it will cement their partisan advantage for 10 years. Finally, the article analyzes data showing the degree of 2011 gerrymandering. Regardless of serious Republican gains in 2010, the Democrats were able to gerrymander several states. This shows that Democrats condemn gerrymandering but abuse redistricting, too. The author forecasts that this duality will persist after 2020. If in control, the Democrats would not only cancel the Republican gerrymandering, but would be willing to use the tool themselves.

DE foundations of knowledge; postmetaphysical ontology; transcendentalism;
   life world; communication
AB The article is devoted to a fundamental cognitive-theoretical problem: the problem of finding the necessary foundations of cognition and identifying conditions that ensure the truth and validity of the results of cognitive activity. In modern epistemology, we can find an ambiguous attitude to this topic. On the one hand, there is a position that proceeds from the fact that the focus on the search for limit conditions that ensure the general validity of the results of cognition is an anachronism. On the other hand, there is a position for which the orientation towards the search for the necessary conditions of cognition remains constitutive for the self-awareness of philosophy as such. The author answers the question of how justified the use of the concept of general significance of knowledge in the context of postmetaphysical ontology is. To solve the problem discussed in the article, the author (1) examines ideas about the foundations of knowledge in classical transcendentalism, (2) indicates the basic principles of postmetaphysical ontology, and (3) discusses the conditions for obtaining universally valid knowledge in the horizon of postmetaphysical ontology. The author establishes that postmetaphysical philosophy proceeds from the thesis of the historicity of our being and thought. Our essential conditionality by history is conceived as a necessary premise on the path to knowledge of the truth rather than as an unavoidable restriction. In epistemological terms, this means that any theoretical activity always bears the imprint of the situation in which it is carried out. Also, in the horizon of postmetaphysical ontology, language and communication are necessary conditions for the possibility of people's social and practical activity, including scientific (cognitive) activity. The language of science grows out of the natural usage of words. This means that the formation of scientific concepts, which begins within a certain interpretation of the world, never starts from scratch. The author concludes that, within the framework of postmetaphysical ontology, the transcendental dimension is reoriented. Language and culture turn out to be a transcendental condition for the possibility of obtaining universally valid knowledge. In communication itself, structures are found that generate the intersubjective significance of knowledge.

AB The article was prepared as part of a research under the state assignment to the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration. It shows that didactics is a practically realizable logic of educational activity understood as a sociocultural phenomenon. The key object of the description is the didactics of open education as a specialized educational system that corresponds to the modern realities of culture reproduction and development, and at the same time differs in key parameters from the educational systems that existed before. The article deals with the problem of the lack of philosophically grounded ideas about the status of didactics in educational practice as a sociocultural system, about the sociocultural components of didactics that ensure the formation of necessary anthropological results after its application. The article aims to substantiate the multidimensional heterogeneous nature of education as a sociocultural phenomenon and the need for didactics as a tool for integrating its various aspects, and to describe the key categories of open education didactics as sociocultural constructs. The research involved: (a) analysis of the evolution of philosophical ideas about education as a heterogeneous sociocultural phenomenon; (b) classification of types of didactics; (c) identification of the key components of each of these types, the structural relation of the components to each other. The basic research methods were: content and genetic analysis of sociocultural phenomena; structure-and-content comparison of explanatory philosophical models with complexes of empirical facts; content analysis of materials for the implementation of specific practices. During the research, the author: (a) reconstructed the evolution of conceptual and philosophical ideas about the heterogeneous nature of education; b) made a classification of the types of pedagogy as a sociocultural phenomenon: pedagogy of model, pedagogy of law, pedagogy of subject, pedagogy of self-determination; (c) identified two main types of didactics corresponding to the types of pedagogy: didactics of closed education and didactics of open education; (d) determined anthropological projects corresponding to each type of didactics (the project of man as an agent of activities obviously external in relation to them for didactics of closed education; the project of evolution of man that constructs their relations and activities independently for didactics of open education); identified the types of thinking that underlie these projects: theoretical thinking as the basis for didactics of closed education, practical thinking as the basis for didactics of open education.

ID COMPLEXITY
AB Complexity science is an intellectual tradition which is deeply rooted in systems theory and information theory. The common premise of these two theories is that different types of systems portray the same qualities in structure and organization, which makes it possible to draw parallels between heterogeneous phenomena. Complexity theory offers terminology and methodology for political science studies, it can give a prism to analyze political institutions and processes. Despite several common junctures with political science, the potential of synergetics for political studies remains underestimated. The advantage of a synergetic approach resides in the fact that it can be used for the analysis of processes at all abstraction levels, from individual to macrosystem. The aim of this article is the systematization of the views on political processes based on synergetic methodology. The article offers the definition and characteristics of complex systems, analyzes the trajectories of their evolutionary development. Agents and leaders in the internal environment are regarded separately. The main characteristics of complex systems are self-organization, interdependence, positive and negative feedback processes, history of interactions, and path dependence. Complex adaptive systems, the main objects of synergetic analysis, change through self-organization, not through guided transformations. Those are non-linear systems, in which a minor change can lead to global consequences. The stronger the connections between the systems are, the higher the probability of cascade effects is. System innovations are introduced under the conditions of low control and high uncertainty. In most cases political problems do not get solutions until they reach crisis levels because political systems are characterized by inertia. Though ideology and group identification provide guidance for the agents' behavior under complex circumstances, they also contribute to system rigidity. Institutional norms that give a frame to political action become the second source of system rigidity. System change occurs either when the external signal is stronger than the inertia, or when the signals accumulate. In politics, complexity is revealed in the following forms: non-linear causality, uneven selection of problems for the agenda, majority veto effect, context effect, and the Titanic effect. Synergetic methodology has an applied character and can lead the political studies to the complexity level, consistent with the complexity level of the phenomena in question.

AB The author assumes that, alongside with a variety of speech acts that are addressed to the other, there are speech acts that are addressed to the speaker himself. These are selfward commands, promises, declaratives, and others. The aim of this article is to show that types of selfward speech acts can be distinguished between each other, and that these differences are fundamental within some areas of philosophical knowledge (ethics, for example). On the basis of Kant's goodwill ethical doctrine, the author shows that the distinction between selfward commissive/directive (roughly, selfward promise / command) and selfward declarative (roughly, selfward manifestation/proclamation) is fundamental. The major result is obtained due to the usage of formal philosophy of action tools, namely, a variation of the propositional dynamic logic. Using these tools, the author manages to demonstrate that free will defines itself with respect to the law of moral action as a deliberative agent (which reflects in formalism with the help of dstit-operator), while the act of free will of defining itself to a certain action is not deliberative (which reflects in formalism with the help of cstit-operator). The analysis of the way these two corresponding formulas show themselves on frames reveals the fundamental distinction between free will modes of action. Selfward declarative is the form of a universal code that is used by free will to make it respect the law of moral action. Selfward commissive/directive is the form of private practical principles (maxims), a form of making free will perform a certain act.

DE Berdyaev; philosophy of history; historiosophy; symbol; Platonism;
   sociology; history
AB This article analyzes the historiosophical system of Nikolai Berdyaev. The author proceeds from the following facts: (1) Berdyaev consciously builds his philosophy of history as a metaphysics of history, which implies the existence of spiritual realities and, in particular, spiritual history ("heavenly history") encompassing both the history of space (natural history) and the history of mankind; (2) Berdyaev believes that the driver of the historical process is heavenly history, which can manifest itself either directly (the incarnation of God) or indirectly through actions of people who, in their existential depth, come into contact with spiritual reality (and therefore with heavenly history); (3) Berdyaev views the history of mankind as the history of human destinies; (4) Berdyaev strives to reveal the meaning or meanings of the historical process. Using Michel Pastoureau's idea of the need to study symbolic history understood as a study of the figurative representations of people about various cultural phenomena, the concept "symbolic history" is conceptualized in relation to Berdyaev's philosophical and historical system. The article analyzes Berdyaev's understanding of the concept "symbol" and the presence of the concept "symbolic" in his philosophical system. In this context, the concepts "objectivization" and "realization", as well as two types of symbolization, "idealistic" and "realistic", are examined. A parallel is drawn between the symbolic interpretation of Berdyaev's philosophy of history and Plato's metaphysical conception. The conclusion is made that the Russian philosopher modernizes the system of his great predecessor by introducing the concepts "history" and "personality" into the philosophical system of the latter, and by recognizing a historical being in a person. The similarity of Peter L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann's concept "symbolic universe" and the symbolic interpretation of Berdyaev's philosophy of history its public dimension is noted. The conclusion is drawn on the advisability of conceptualizing the concept "symbolic history". Based on this, two aspects of the existential being of a person in history are revealed in Berdyaev's historiosophical system, and specifically in the history of human destinies: the existential sufferer (a person as a passive participant in history) and the existential creator (a person as an active participant in history). The latter aspect is associated with the meaning-constructing dimension of a person's historical being; due to this dimension, specific people and society as a whole have an idea of the "historical" in general and about its individual phenomena, and this "historical" may differ from reliable positive historical facts. The author refers to this dimension as the symbolic aspect of Berdyaev's philosophy of history.

AB This article is devoted to the study of the definition of religion in contemporary conditions. In the first part of the article, the author argues that the classical view of the sphere of the religious was based on a secular ideology. In contemporary conditions of the so-called "religious revival", the concept of religion as a specific "sphere" of spiritual culture is not effective. It cannot explain why religious experience continues to be relevant, despite the progress of science, which religion could not compete with according to the belief of the classics of the philosophy of religion. The classical philosophy of religion itself is called into question as a rather specific phenomenon that arose in the context of secularization and is based on a reductionist perception of religion as one of the areas of human experience that is localized in a certain sector and does not affect other areas of social life. The classical philosophy of religion became possible as a result of the development of a secular ideology, which for the first time in history presented the world as initially "natural" and "immanent", and religion as an artificial attempt to build a "second floor" of reality. A new definition of religion in the perspective of postsecular philosophy is needed. The second part of the article analyzes the experience of a religious conversion of two famous thinkers of the past decades; the modern "theological turn" has found expression in their writings and experience. The thinkers represent two influential areas of modern intellectual life - natural science (Francis Collins) and postmodern philosophy (Gianni Vattimo). The history of their conversions was gradual and led to a radical transformation of their attitude to religious experience. The latter fact is of great importance for understanding the gradual entry of the theological dimension into the complex fabric of the antitheistic space of modern philosophy. The third part of the article concludes that the secular perception of religious experience has exhausted itself. Guided by this perception, it is impossible today to provide an adequate explanation of what is happening in the contemporary world of religious revival. In the form of an "experience of love" rather than a metanarration, religion transcends the limits of the sectoral ghetto that secular ideology has long tried to limit. Religion is revealed not as an "area of spiritual culture" that rivals philosophy and science, but as an additional dimension that can be diffusely combined with both philosophical thinking and scientific research. It is suggested that the concept of the "pole of culture" can be considered a more effective definition of religion in contemporary conditions.

AB The study is devoted to the military-political and military-economic relations between the United States and the European Union. At the end of 2017, the EU announced the launch of two projects: Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) and European Defence Fund (EDF). These organizations aimed to develop the European armed forces and the military-industrial complex. The U.S. have criticized these initiatives, noting that they could harm transatlantic relations. The main goal of the study is to analyze the contradictions that emerged after the launch of PESCO and EDF. The research is based on the positions of the U.S. and EU officials, Russian and foreign experts, as well as on the use of statistical data. The author analyzes four main issues. Firstly, it is the features of the U.S. - EU relationship in the defen.e sector. It is concluded that a better model for Washington would be the growth of European spendings in the absence of institutions development. There are also some difficulties in the export control system, the unequal dependence of the United States and the EU on arms exports. Secondly, American criticism of PESCO and EDF is observed. The main admonitions come down to a serious restriction of non-European companies' participation. The U.S. warns its allies against protectionism on the European defen.e market and negative consequences for cooperation in R&D. Thirdly, export control issues are studied. The system that exists between the United States and different European countries is not evenly developed. It prevents the EU from obtaining necessary technologies and impedes its exports. This situation is an incentive for the development of independent European projects in defen.e. Forth, a comparison of mutual arms trade and R&D expenditures is made. The United States do not have an objective need for the procurement of European arms. In turn, the EU imports 25% of its armament from the U.S. The development of PESCO and EDF may have a limited negative impact on American exports to Europe, as well as impede the U.S. participation in R&D projects. The most sensitive restrictions can be made in the field of unmanned systems. The author concludes that there are systemic contradictions in transatlantic relations that impede the development of PESCO and EDF. The United States are not dependent on EU arms imports. But maintaining existing ties has important political motives. It contributes to the possibility of Washington's influence on the allies. However, the existing model is pushing the European Union to create separate defen.e projects. At the same time, the development of PESCO and EDF would force the United States to discourage such trends.

AB The article examines the activities of the Russian political elite in governing socioeconomic policy in modem Russia. The article analyzes the influence of the quality of human capital of the Russian elite on the effectiveness of Russia's modem socioeconomic policy. Focusing on the qualitative characteristics of the Russian elite, the authors pay special attention to the analysis of the main components and consequences of its socioeconomic policy. As the present study shows, the lack of professionalism and incompetence of the majority of the Russian elite in matters of socioeconomic policy and their disregard of economic laws negatively affect the development of Russia, do not allow creating an innovative economy, ensuring a high quality of life for the majority of Russian citizens. The huge property differentiation of Russian society and the low standard of living of most Russians not only contribute to the growth of social tension in society, but also hinder the development of Russia as a whole. According to the authors, the human capital of the Russian elite has not yet reached quality indicators comparable to the developed countries of the world and is not always a decisive factor in the innovative development of the regions and the national economy. Therefore, the modernization of the human capital of the Russian elite should become a priority direction of the state policy of modern Russia.

DE Nietzsche; theory of truth; pragmatism; metaphors; anti-realism
AB The article considers the theory of truth in the concept of philosophy of language proposed by Friedrich Nietzsche. A large number of researchers significant for the analytic tradition (Arthur Danto, Richard Rorty, etc.) draw a parallel between Nietzsche's philosophy and the positions of American pragmatists (especially William James and John Dewey). Pragmatism does not consider truth in a correspondent sense, but as a set of definitions that can be considered useful for everyday life. Such a connection between truth and utility can indeed be found in Nietzsche's works, but the concept of truth is embedded in the language theory he develops. From Nietzsche's point of view, it is not individual statements that are useful, but the language itself as it forms the external and internal reality of the individual. Such an interpretation of language allows looking differently at the problems of realism and anti-realism related to the names of Hilary Putnam and Richard Rorty, and, although Rorty tries to point to his connection with Nietzsche's ideas, there are a number of fundamental differences between their positions. One such difference is the interpretation of metaphors (Donald Davidson); although there are certain similarities between Nietzsche's and Davidson's views, this understanding of language does not allow considering these theories relevant to each other. If in Davidson's analysis metaphors do not express anything new about facts/objects, in Nietzsche's philosophy objects themselves (as well as subjects opposed to them) are considered as metaphors, i.e. linguistically loaded constructs. Therefore, metaphors should be considered as a way of changing our language games. Since this will directly disrupt an individual's communication with society, such a process cannot be considered as pragmatically oriented. This leads to a key difference between Nietzschean and pragmatic positions: the usefulness of our false conceptions allows us to call them truths, but Nietzsche denies that such "truths" have a certain metaphysical basis. Truth should be regarded exclusively as a "metaphor" that allows other metaphors of our reality (subject, object, cognition, etc.) to work. The supporters of the deflationary theory of truth interpret the concept of truth in a similar way.

   micro- and macrolevels of social structure
AB The article attempts to find an opportunity to examine the micro- and macrolevels of the legal field in general and the institution of punishment in particular. The representative of social macrotheory is Marxism with its analysis of socioeconomic formations, the driving forces of history, dialectics, as opposed to Foucault's "microphysics of power". The problems considered in the article can be formulated as follows: is it possible to connect Foucault's ideas about prison as a special type of a penitentiary institution, which has become a kind of a prototype, model for a panoptic society, with Marxist ideas about the law? How are private relations on the exchange of goods related to disciplining practices? The so-called "exchange" theory of law by Evgeny Pashukanis is taken as the "junction point" of the micro- and macrolevels of social processes studies. Pashukanis offers an original legal concept that deduces the content of law from market relations: legal phenomena are similar to those that occur during commodity exchange, and the basic concepts of law-legal norm, legal relationship, subject of law - are an expression of economic relations; in turn, the basic concepts of market economy - goods, value-have their "legal" content. Pashukanis focuses on criminal law, which has the most "visible" legal force. Justice is the equivalent of commodity exchange, a kind of an involuntary contract, the essence of which is the forced restoration of justice through punishment, through payment by the offender (debtor) of the cost of the harm caused to the whole society. Turning to the consideration of penalties related to imprisonment, Pashukanis discovers a phenomenon that, in many ways, will become the main content of Foucault's Discipline and Punish. Pashukanis claims that there is a certain discrepancy in the form and content of this kind of punishment: the actual practice of prison activities is connected not only with the isolation of criminals, but also with procedures for their correction, discipline, and education. In short, these activities are excessive in relation to its form (isolation from society). As a conclusion, the trends of changing the institution of punishment in the direction of its medicalization are outlined, which indicates the formation of a new type of the power - knowledge system, "biopower" by Foucault.

DT Article
DE proof; logic; mathematics; type theory; Curry-Howard correspondence;
   homotopy type theory; intuitionism
AB The article is the third part of a study of the epistemological features of the concept of proof within the framework of a type-theoretic approach. The article discusses issues related to the concept of proof from the point of view of the classical version of the "propositions-as-types" doctrine (the Curry-Howard correspondence) and the modern version of the "propositions-as-some-types" doctrine (a version of the Curry-Howard correspondence from the point of view of homotopy type theory). This topic was partially discussed in the previous article. This article highlights a number of important aspects and nuances, examines the current state of research, and offers some epistemological conclusions. The Curry-Howard correspondence is a non-trivial connection between logic and typed computations. The semantics for intuitionistic logic according to the BHK-interpretation is traditionally given in terms of proofs. A statement is considered true if there is an evidence for it, and is considered false if there is a refutation for it. The BHK-interpretation allows us to talk about the dynamics and statics of proof. The type-theoretic approach is a variant of the interpretation of logical concepts and, accordingly, a new look at logic. This approach allows one to discover a certain kind of a "vertical unity" of logic. An updated view of the relationship between logic, typed lambda calculus, and category theory can be termed the doctrine of "propositions-as-some-types". Propositions are considered as types of a strictly defined type, while other types are not directly considered as propositions. This point of view can be illustrated by referring, for example, to the internal logic of topos or to homotopy type theory. The "propositions-as-types" doctrine assumes that every proposition corresponds to some type, and the proofs of a given proposition correspond to terms of that type. The situation is different with the understanding of logic within the framework of the "propositions-as-some-types" doctrine. Homotopy type theory offers some clarification of the status of logic and its concepts. Terms related to a certain type are still understood as different proofs (or rather objects-proofs), and differences between them can be easily abstracted away. The level of "pure" logic in the homotopy hierarchy is limited to -1 level, and logic becomes a "special case of geometry". This reduction is possible thanks to the powerful concept of identity. At the level of "pure" logic, there are rules for introduction and elimination, and, at higher levels, at which types are understood as fundamental groupoids, there are rules for constructing mathematical structures that lie outside of "pure" logic. Type theory is a more powerful tool for analyzing the concept of proof than traditional "pure" logic, which allows one to build systems for automatic and interactive proofs, much closer to ordinary mathematical proofs and mathematical intuition.

DT Article
DE policy rhetoric; narrative; affect; hysteria
AB The article is devoted to the narrative aspects of the foreign policy rhetoric of Russia. It singles out the stages of its development (since 1994), its content, and its plot. The current intensity of affect in politics is often explained through psychological or even neurological reasons, but, in this article, the authors tried to place it into the literary and rhetorical context. The politicians responsible for framing the Russian national policy use narrative constructions that are supposed to channel the audience's negative feelings and to reinforce them. The emotionality of politics has to do with the ambivalence of international relations conceived either as an unexpected encounter with evil forces or as a frustration of hopes and rejection of appeals by a superior power. In the former case, the narrative (both tragic and sentimental) tells of Russia's striving for its shining future which constantly fails through the intervention of bad luck. In the latter case, Russia's kind and friendly intentions and initiatives meet with neglect on the part of the West, all this in the context of the incessant clashes with the "evil". Russia's identity is defined ambivalently, as the identity of a victim and of a hero, which produces tension periodically spilling into international conflicts. In the current period, the frustrations and the attacks of evil forces are ousted into the past, and the narrative proceeds from Russia's victory that is supposed to have already happened. However, these victory claims remain ambivalent because they are accompanied by emotional appeals to the West. These appeals put into question both the rupture with it and the independence from it, they bring us back to the failed hopes and to the trauma of rupture, thus producing a hysterical model of living the narrative's plot: the model that supports permanent and passive anxiety. Ceasing the intense communication with the West through the script of a novel, heroic fairy tale, or "hysteria" is possible with the mythical format of a "triumph of the hero over the beast", in which the hero would rely on his/her forces and depart from the meaningless dialogue with the "kings". With all its fictional nature, this narrative is less emotionally charged than in the first two cases. Therefore, it could potentially reduce the strain of the foreign policy process, unless it is just a phase of a dialogical anger reminding of Homer's Achilles: the offended hero withdraws to his ship and feasts there alone.

DE social inequality; environmental inequality; environmental sociology;
   environmental risk; ecological culture
AB The article discusses a new type of social inequality - environmental inequality. This inequality is a consequence of the global environmental problems of our time and of the uneven distribution of environmental risks associated with people's different natural living conditions and, as they primarily are the result of human activities, with the redistribution of negative environmental consequences between different subjects of social relations (countries, regions, social groups). Since environmental problems became the subject of sociological analysis only in the second half of the 20th century, there is currently no single definition of socioecological inequality and its dimensions. The aim of the article is to systematize modern sociological approaches to the conceptualization of the concept "environmental inequality" by identifying key characteristics and dimensions of this new form of social inequality. The theoretical basis of the article is works by modern foreign and domestic researchers (J. Gobert, A. Mol, S. Hackfort, S.P. Bankovskaya. O.N. Yanitsky, and others), the empirical basis is the data of reports of the World Health Organization, the UN, etc. The social aspects of environmental problems, including environmental inequality, are considered in the framework of environmental sociology that arose in the second half of the 20th century. The article presents different positions regarding what name the new industry may have. Based on the analysis, the author comes to the conclusion that the most important issues for sociology are: firstly, the distinction between socially determined environmental risks and threats and natural differences; secondly, the identification of the relationship between environmental inequality and other (including traditional) forms of social inequality; thirdly, the study of the social consequences (current and potential) of environmental problems and the development of recommendations to reduce or prevent them. Special attention is paid to the contradictions of social development: at present, the growth of welfare and quality of life of the population is closely linked to environmental degradation. The article also outlines the social consequences of environmental problems of our time, such as new social conflicts and contradictions, intensification of migration processes and environmental refugees, reduction in economic growth, an increase of poverty and a decrease of the quality of life, as well as an increase in the economic burden on states. The conclusion is drawn about the relevance of the sociological analysis of environmental problems and the need for an interdisciplinary approach to the study of the interaction of society and nature.

DE patriotism; civic identity; love of motherland; civic duty
AB The article proposes versions of conceptualization of patriotism as a methodological basis for the research. It considers the concepts of patriotism as a specific sociopolitical attitude that forms a special state of political consciousness and moral feeling aimed at fulfilling civic duty to the state and its institutions. The condition for the formation of patriotism is the compliance of the activities of these institutions with the interests of citizens. The authors assume that the concepts "love of motherland" and "patriotism" describe essentially different phenomena. The concept love of motherland" describes a phenomenon that has a primordial essence. The concept "patriotism" refers to the political background and is defined through attitudes towards the state and civic duties. The authors argue that patriotism has a specific historical character and is transformed depending on the dynamics of social relations. There was no social basis for constructive patriotism to appear in Russia because of the weakness of the Russian bourgeoisie, the potential adherents of this type of patriotism. The concept of patriotism relying on paternalist tradition was proposed. There also existed other interpretations of patriotism. In fact, the conceptual split showed only the value and social split of the society. Consequently, when the split moved to its "hot stage" with the beginning of the Civil War, the war became the confrontation between different interpretations of patriotism. Modern Russia, like the pre-revolutionary, has not formed a fully-fledged civil society as the social basis for constructive patriotism. Following the suggested conceptualization of patriotism, the authors interpreted the results of a survey they conducted in March and April 2018 in Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug. The survey examined factors determining patriotic attitudes in citizens' minds and behavior. All respondents showed an inherent feeling of love for their motherland, but there were significant differences in their patriotic stances. The different stances depended on the assessment of the compliance of the activities of state institutions with the interests of society and citizens. The relationship was direct: the more patriotic the activities of the institutions of power seemed to the respondents, the more patriotic the respondents felt to be. Depending on this assessment, the survey identified clusters of the respondents: active patriots, passive patriots, non-patriots. The authors conclude that it is possible to form an attitude to search for "more patriotic" actors in the political consciousness of the population.

DE Sarmatian archaeological culture; speculative model; network model;
   methodology of material remains study
AB The assumption that cultures are clearly defined, essentially self-contained entities has been subjected to serious doubt in modern archaeology which needs to be reflected also in Sarmatian studies. Such concepts as 'Sarmatians', 'Sarmatian period' and 'Sarmatian archaeological culture(s)' are widely used in archaeological literature. However, the monuments of the different macro-regions that are usually connected in scholarship with the various Sarmatian communities and political entities mentioned in the written sources have significant cultural distinctions. The nature of these differences has not been reliably clarified yet. This leads to contradictions in the interpretation of the same culture groups by representatives of different schools of archaeology. The basic cause of the contradictions lies in the flaws of the argumentation procedure, which appears to be speculative, and thus devoid of any heuristic potential. It is necessary to develop common approaches to the interpretation of the archaeological material. A promising approach in this regard might be the network model. Such models will make it possible to define an archaeological culture as a stable set of features, objects and phenomena of the material world, reflecting the network connections formed and operating in a certain area within a particular period.

AB The factor that has led to the analysis of various problems of constitutional regulation is the lack of systematic scientific knowledge about the existing theoretical and legal problems of the phenomenon in focus and the ways of its improvement. This has posed a task of specifying the existing technical, legal, logical, grammatical inconsistencies, gaps and defects of the Constitution of the Russian Federation and working out effective ways to overcome them. Among such problems is the presence in the text of the Russian Constitution of a large number of hidden terms that implying a different content, the non-observance of the logical sequence of the use of terms, the inaccurate use of verbal moods. The purpose of the present article is to analyze the ways to improve the constitutional regulation of the Russian Federation as a political and legal phenomenon. The leading method of research is the comparative legal method that makes it possible to identify the urgent theoretical and legal problems of constitutional regulation. The result of the study consists in the description of effective ways to overcome problems of constitutional regulation in the Russian Federation. In particular, it is proposed to organize on a continuing basis activities aimed at including in the legal dictionaries and doctrinal comments the terminology that reveals the content of constitutional regulation, and to work on the diversification of its methodology. The materials of the article can be useful for the representatives of the legal science of the countries of the Romano-Germanic legal family, scholars in the field of constitutional comparative law, and students of law schools.

DE culture; global; local; postcolonial studies; spatial turn
AB The article reveals the influence of the discourse of "global" and "local" on the transformation of the methodology of studying culture. The connection between the discourse of "global" and "local" and the discourses of postmodemism, postcolonial studies, the discourse of post-non-classical rationality, the discourse of spatial turn is traced. The combination of these discourses entailed the problematization of the model of European science, the rethinking of the phenomena of domination and submission, the actualization of research interest in systems of discursive, epistemological, and cultural exclusion. The main scientific results of the study are establishing the mutual influence of the phenomena of "global" and "local". "Local" is seen as original against the backdrop of "global", "universal", "standardized". The concepts "global" and "local" are formed in the modern era. The processes of globalization generate interest in the local, regional, unique-all this does not fit into the unified project of a single global world. Postcolonial studies and the decolonial turn criticize colonial thinking patterns that reproduce dominance and subalternism in science and in cultural reality. The discourse of plurality becomes possible only with the failure of supremacy and domination of the subject over the object. It is necessary to allow the subaltern to speak the language he wants to speak, and not the language he wants to hear. Manifesting a post-non-classical rationality, Vyacheslav Styopin states the need to conduct a methodological audit. In the modern era, no social, cultural, political theory claims to be universal and explaining everything. The global world does not have common ethical foundations. Marginal discursive practices were supplanted into the background space of culture and recognized as no longer relevant. However, the background space of culture creates innovations and is able to reconsolidate modern culture.

DE memory; ideologeme; narrative; narrative analysis; communication of
   memory and ideology; cognitive science
AB The study is devoted to the urgent scientific problem of finding the possibilities of using Big Data in processing results of qualitative analysis. The article attempts to combine the advantages of qualitative narrative analysis with the quantitative form of a sociological survey. This study presents the results of an experiment on the implementation of narrative analysis in the form of a quantitative method for studying ideology. The goal is to assess the possibilities of using the quantitative form of narrative analysis based on the results of its testing on the basis of an empirical study of cognitive and ideological attitudes of students of the south of Russia in 2019 with the number of respondents in 2,500 people. The method of quantitative narrative analysis is given a theoretical and methodological substantiation. The theoretical basis was the ideological concepts of Michael Freeden; the ideas of Hayden White and Frank Ankersmit, the founders of the narrative approach to history; George Lakoff s theory of cognitive metaphor. To conduct an empirical study, the concept of narrative as a cognitive metaphor was operationalized. The research methodology, which consists in using questions requiring narrative answers in the questionnaire and the method for their quantitative processing and interpretation of the results, is described. Methods for verifying the findings are proposed. The empirical experience of using the method of quantitative narrative analysis in political cognitive science has led to the conclusion that it can be applied to the study of ideological communication. The undoubted advantage is the new opportunities for working with Big Data on the problems of hidden forms of group consciousness and ideological attitudes. A limitation of the application of the method is the subjectivity of the estimates at the stage of interpreting the results and the complexity of the quantitative processing of the answers. An empirical study made it possible to substantiate the concept of cognitive communication of memory and ideology. The result of a narrative analysis of the process of ideological communication was the identification of nuclear and peripheral ideologies in a specific cultural and historical context. Based on the thesis that narrative is a reflection of social experience, it was concluded that respondents had such ideas as a response to changes in the modern political process, manifested in the anticipation of a socioeconomic crisis, environmental catastrophe and fears of an increase in Russia's involvement in military conflicts. The assumption is made that the prospects for further research on the topic of quantification of narrative research data are directly related to the search for a solution to the urgent global scientific problem of the lack of qualitative databases unlike the availability of numerous quantitative data banks.

AB The author of the article presents the concept of media noise as a risk-generating phenomenon. She defines the introduced concept; identifies and analyzes modern risk factors determining the problem of background media consumption, especially media consumption by children and adolescents; describes the conceptual and methodological foundations of the study of media noise as the degree of the saturation of a living space with media signals that distress and exploit the organs of perception. On the basis of theoretical approaches to the understanding of media, communication, noise, information overload, and information stress available in science, the author deduces the concept of media noise. The article analyzes the results of third party empirical studies of the practice of media consumption, which reveal the problematic aspects of forcing the consumption of media signal as a background of life. The author notes that the widespread use of media, particularly audio content (including audio ads, playing music in public, active background screens, etc.), is correlated with the problem of new forms of violence and violations of the space of personal autonomy. The article presents the results of a pilot study of the dependence of the degree of media noise and the level of anxiety in children aged 16-17. The author shows correlations between individual parameters (factors) of media noise; lists the main social situations of children's forced consumption of media as a background; notes the potential of background media consumption to model social situations ("turn on" the situation "I am at home" or "we are traveling") and become an adaptation strategy; and determines the directions and prospects of further research of the problem of the use of media as a background of life activity and of the study of the emotionality of audio content in relation to the formation of the social pattern of media consumption.

AB The article discusses how a protest identity is formed, what the meaning of protesters' activities is, and how this meaning determines protesters' life priorities. The empirical basis of the article is a secondary analysis of studies on Russian cities, statistical data, analysis of the course and results of election campaigns, publications in the media and social networks, regular observations of rallies, interviews, conversations with activists (more than 50), several focus groups and seminars. The theoretical framework of the study is set by Jack Goldstone's model, which proposes a prognostic model of extraordinary events of various - from state and national to organizational - scales. The model is based on the effectiveness of government (the ability of the state to reproduce social institutions and meet cultural expectations), on the degrees of dissatisfaction and of competition of elites, and on protesters' ideas about the regime. Based on the collected data, the author argues that the basis of protest is a complex of emotional reactions associated with the violation of the usual perception of the position of the group the individual identifies himself with (scream). The next stage is the organization of the community, establishment of regular interaction, development of goals and means to achieving them, nomination of leaders (work). Notably, this activity is rather selfless in nature. Over time, interacting with enemy opponents, protest becomes an element of personal life (faith). The main directions of modern protest are: state patriotic, socialist, and liberal. Presumably, in prosperous, democratic cities with developed media (Irkutsk, Novosibirsk, Krasnoyarsk, Tomsk, Abakan), protest associations will become an element of formal political competition. Street politics will be a significant complement, a demonstration of strength, a way of uniting around the leaders of all the three directions (state patriotic, socialist, and liberal). In cities of average economic prosperity with serious environmental and social problems (Kemerovo, Novokuznetsk, Omsk, Chita), protest is more likely to occur in the form of short-term local outbreaks. In cities with a difficult economic and social situation (Gomo-Altaysk, Kyzyl, Ulan-Ude, Barnaul), effective protests are unlikely.

DE national-civic identity; Russian youth; political socialization;
   political consciousness; simulated identities
AB The article analyzes the specifics and the main problematic aspects of the national-civic identity design of youth in the new-digital-era. The author pays special attention to such factors of the identificational transformation of the mass consciousness of young Russians as change in the communicative landscape of Russian society, a comprehensive "Internetization" of sociopolitical practices, and the cultural and psychological effects associated with it. Among the problems associated with the construction of the national-civic identity of modern Russian youth, the author identifies the weakness of the cognitive and symbolic foundation of the civic self-identification of young Russians, the dominance of fragmentary, rather than holistic, ideas about Russian history as particularly significant. An equally significant problem is the vague temporal frames of the "image of us", the amorphousness and poor cognitive content of the "image of a collective future". In the political consciousness of Russian youth, this image is usually extremely amorphous and often contains depressive elements. At the same time, the lack of the image of a nationwide future enhances the feeling of sociopolitical deprivation, reduces the motivation for positive political participation, and provokes protest moods among young people. Another significant problem of the national-civic self-identification of Russian youth is also related to the specifics of information consumption in the digital era. It is rooted in the fact that youth as a whole, especially representatives of Generation Z, have a predominantly mosaic political consciousness, which is based on the unwillingness to perceive cognitively complex constructs and on the orientation to the emotional component of political reality perception. It is important to note that the older Russian youth-representatives of Generation Y-are less affected by simulated reality. At the same time, "digital natives"-representatives of Generation Z-are at the epicenter of the formation of a "virtual" political reality, in which the traditional tools of civil socialization lose their effectiveness.

DE argumentation; argumentative reasoning; evaluation of arguments; formal
   models of argumentation
AB This article discusses the formal modelling of argumentation. The fundamental characteristics of argumentative reasoning, which play the key role in evaluating arguments, are examined. The authors focus on the distinctive features of natural reasoning. Real practice of reasoning is frequently accompanied by usage of deductively incorrect arguments as justifications of certain statements that arise within polemical situations. Another peculiarity of natural reasoning the authors analyse consists in its nonmonotonicity, i.e., extending the set of premises of a certain valid argument affects its validity. Thus, the possibility of constructing a simple and intuitively plausible formal theory that allows grasping the aforementioned phenomena is the main aim of the article. The authors suggest a formal explication of the evidence relation between an argument and a thesis. This explication can take into account the variability of the entailment relation, i.e., allows dealing with both deductive and inductive arguments within the same framework. The suggested explication of evidence relation is substantially grounded on the notion of reasoning by modulo, which, in turn, is a suitable tool for analysing deductively incorrect arguments. The suggested explication of argumentative reasoning (critique and refutation) allows distinguishing between different kinds of nonmonotonicity (modifiability) of argumentative reasoning and, furthermore, drawing the distinction between several types of relations between premises (arguments) and conclusion (thesis): deductive reasoning by modulo, inductive consequence, and (argumentative) evidence relation.

DE network approach; social network; social construct
AB This article discusses the role of social constructing as an epistemological position essential for the development of the network approach and for the expansion of network tools. Differences both in the theoretical grounds and in the methodological foundation of the key directions of the network approach are stated. The main questions that are to be answered by the three trends of the network approach: social network analysis, relational sociology, and actor-network theory, are identified. The ontological status of social networks is specified. The continuity and relevance of the network approach to the ideas of structuralism are recognized. The idea is substantiated that finding optimal tools to answer the questions requires a "social network" construct presented as an abstract object. It is argued that researchers' work with a truncated part of a network construct, aimed at analyzing only the measured characteristics of an object, can produce inaccurate and distorted results. Thus, researchers of social networks often do not take into account unobserved network characteristics: predictors of the proto-network's potential readiness for objectification, network unification, and errors of first-order observers' interpretations. In addition, when working with an already made construct, second-order observers may miss such characteristics of social networks as the plasticity of the network structure, the axiological commonality of network actors and the similarity of their everyday background practices, target diversification. The procedures for constructing an abstract network object are designed to fill these gaps and "complete" the theoretical framework, forming a set of ideas about social networks that are consistent with reality. It is stated that, when constructing a social network, it is necessary to avoid the conviction that the social object is autonomous in relation to the cognizing subject and to reconsider the axiomatic assumptions of some unobserved parameters, characteristics, and properties of the object.

AB The Russian economy and its modern transformations are of great interest to French researchers. The economic history of Russia has become the subject of analysis-of the book by J. Vercueil "Political economy of Russia: 1918-2018". In it, from the standpoint of modern French regulationism (a type of institutionalism-), questions of economic reforms in Russia and their evolution over the past 30 years are considered. The article analyzes three basic concepts of the French author, defining the modern Russian economic system: (1) "Russian disease" as a kind of Dutch disease; (2) rental mode of accumulation; (3) the "Gazprom" way of regulating the economy. In addition, the originality of the use of the term "political economy" is considered with reference to a specific country; Vercueil's interpretation of the theory of "economics of shortage" by J. Kornai; the mechanism for resolving the problem of arrears in a transition economy, as well as the issues of classification and periodization of economic reforms, their pace and content. The role and place of economic advisers and the IMF in the course of Gaidar reforms are discussed. The article gives a critical analysis of the propositions and hypotheses put forward by the author.

DE school; language; poly-ethnic society; consolidation; identity
AB In modern conditions of the world economy's monopolization, sanctions, the flow of external migration of the labor force is an urgent problem of the necessity at the state level to preserve the cohesion and unity of the multiethnic Russian society. The article examines the historical development of Russia, where the school as a social institution performs not only an educational function but also the role of consolidating the multiethnic composition of the state.
   Russian language and culture fulfill this role through the school. Russian is historically considered as the language of integration of nations who have passed their ethnogenesis on the territory of Russia, their spiritual and cultural rapprochement with the Russians by the method of N. I. Ilminsky while preserving the native languages of students. Performing the function of consolidation, the Russian language acted as an integrator of nations, not their assimilator, as evidenced by statistics on the actual existence of more than 230 languages and dialects of nations.
   The article notes that in Russian politics before the reconstruction period, the school, performing a consolidating function, was a tool for leveling the ethnic characteristics of students, through unitary language training, forming national-Russian bilingualism.
   The analysis of scientific sources shows that such conditions before the reconstruction period led to objective facts not manifestations of interethnic conflicts. Also, during the entire Soviet period, literary languages were created and developed, and dialects were preserved to some extent, but, unfortunately, the functions of native languages were narrowed in social spheres. Describing the post-soviet period, cultural and linguistic diversity is noted, which is a significant source of social conflicts and political discussions. Under these conditions, cultural and linguistic state homogeneity becomes a subject of dissatisfaction in the public life of speakers of minority languages. The problem arises as to how to guarantee the participation of each language group in the life of a multilingual society with their socio-cultural integration, without violating international human rights legislation.

AB The article considers the key issues related to the North Korea's nuclear problem in the context of the present policies of the United States towards the DPRK, as well as new priorities and evolving approaches of the Republican Administration regarding the tasks of providing peaceful resolution on the Korean Peninsula. It has been revealed that in recent years, the policy of President D. Trump in that area has been resolutely reshaped away from attachment to "military option" towards the search for negotiated solutions of the nuclear issue. In the paper, special attention is paid to the review of results achieved in the course of the dialogue as well as to assessment of the reasons which had led to its failure. It has been shown that the course of the incumbent Administration regarding North Korea is widely criticized in the United States for its inability to produce tangible outcomes. According to many estimates, the results of the American-North Korean summit meetings have revealed the only fact that presently, the DPRK has no intent to abandon either its nuclear weapons or delivery means. Moreover, Pyongyang has taken the occasion of the talks to augment its nuclear arsenal and upgrade the ballistic missiles capabilities. However, the ongoing discussion in the United States on the nuclear issue has highlighted that political opponents of President Trump have not yet succeeded in proposing any reasonable alternative to his policy. It can be assumed that the meaningful comprehension of the current situation as well as practical policy-making process will restart only after the presidential elections in the United States. In this vein, the author suggests his estimates of the prospects for progress in the settlement of the Korean crisis, which are provided together with the consideration of potential scenarios for future developments. It is argued that the most preferable and rational option should be the building of international cooperation and launching multilateral arrangement for a dialogue with the DPRK to resolve the nuclear issue.

TI FACTORS AND DETERMINANTS OF THE POLITICAL PARTICIPATION OF ETHNIC GROUPS

LA English
DT Article
DE Neoinstitutionalism; Political participation; Social groups; Ethnic

AB This article discusses the problem of identifying factors and determinants of the political participation of ethnic groups in politics. Some people see political participation as an activity by which individuals try to influence the government through ethnic groups to carry out the actions they want. Others believe that the engine of political activity is an individual's need for internal improvement when political participation contributes to its full functioning in the life of the State and gives it a sense of involvement in political processes. A comprehensive approach to determining the essence of political participation by ethnic groups is justified, according to which the institution of political participation is a multifaceted socio-cultural phenomenon that affects many aspects of the socio-political dynamics of modern society. According to this approach, political participation is also manifested in democratic and undemocratic political regimes; at the same time, the trigger for political mobilization may be not only the impact of political leaders, but also their own need for people to participate actively in political processes.

   Asian Russia in the Grip of the Civil War
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE historical education; science; historians; Revolution; Civil War;
   Siberia; Far East
AB The history of higher education, science, and academia in the Asian part of Russia has been extensively covered in historiography. Historians have focused on various aspects of these phenomena in connection with social, cultural, economic, as well as political and ideological processes. In most cases, these processes have been approached from two different perspectives. The first one focuses on the center-periphery relations and entails a comparison of the provincial processes with what was happening in the center of Russia. The second concentrates on regional and local processes, including at the micro level. However, the period of the Revolution of 1917 and the Civil War (1918-1920) in the history of Asiatic Russia is of particular importance for the scientific and educational complex of the region in general and for its social sciences and humanities segment, in particular. The authors' focus is history. Historical research itself, education, science, and the corporation of historians in the paradigm of that period played the most important structure-forming roles. The political, ideological, and sociocultural implications of historical research (the formation of the historical consciousness, civic and political identity and culture, ideological attitudes, moral values, patriotism) are difficult to overestimate. In the period of uncertainty of the development of both the country as a whole and its Asiatic periphery (when the outcome of the armed confrontation was not obvious to anyone), the role of historians in different spheres of the state and society grows, they become important actors of key processes, epitomized by the so-called "third the role of universities". The study of these aspects of historians' activities, the mechanisms of their interaction, the influence on the system of social interactions and other aspects, foregrounds this new trend in historical research. The work is written on the basis of a wide range of historical sources: official documents and materials (laws and regulations on the organization of higher education and science); archival materials (most of them are first introduced into academic discourse) - organizational, administrative records that reflect daily activities of universities and research institutions; materials of regional and local periodicals; sources of personal origin; historiography of the Asiatic periphery. In the course of the study, the authors come to the conclusion that the initiative to develop historical research, academic institutions, strengthen the "third role" of universities and scientific communities was generated both "bottom-up" and "top-down". Both historians and public legal entities, that is authorities at all levels, benefited in these relations.

AB The article presents the main problems of the theory and practice of criminal activity in the modern teenage environment. The statistical data of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation and the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia of the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation of criminal offenses committed from 2003 to the present period by juvenile offenders are given [as of June 1, 2020].
   The author analyzes the features of the criminal youth subculture. Typologization is carried out according to the types of youth informal groups. The main causes of juvenile delinquency are identified and justified. Spectral analysis is carried out for these reasons (motives). The factors provoking crime in a teenage environment are determined.
   The author revealed that one of the negative conditions for the formation of delinquent and deviant behavior of adolescents is the early start of work.
   At present, adolescents from 14 years old are going through a process of socialization and familiarization with work in the conditions of transformation of socio-economic, political, sanctions relations. The transformation in Russia led to the use of various illegal forms, in particular related to the involvement of street children (10-15 years old and 16-18 years old) in the criminal business.
   The author determines that juvenile delinquency is primarily determined by the characteristics of the personality of the offender. The main thing in its consideration was the minority of the offender. Certain biological, psychological and mental changes in the structure of the personality are associated with it. Age determines a certain level of development of forces, intelligence, drives, and even the "physical" ability to commit certain crimes.
   Also, the author of the article determined that the process of socialization of an individual begins at an early age, when he begins to assimilate the roles that form his personal qualities. It is in childhood that any person is formed as a social being, he develops intelligence, the ability to analyze and generalize the surrounding phenomena, the ability to anticipate the possible consequences of his actions; such volitional qualities as perseverance, determination, self-control, activity, initiative are developed; self-awareness, self-esteem, desire for independence are formed. All this is closely related to the subsequent behavior of the personality of a minor offender.
   The author interprets such a basic concept as "criminal youth subculture".
   The regional statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia on offenses as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic in Russia is given.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE European Union; PESCO Program; NATO; crisis response; military-political
   development; military-technical cooperation
AB The article analyzes the origins and current trends in the development of the crisis response structures and mechanisms within the European Union. The reasons for the failures of the EU in the implementation of the plans of previous decades to create EU Armed Forces separate from NATO are being considered. Thirty-four military, police, border and consultative operations and EU missions in conflict regions are being typologized in the article. It is concluded that the most in-demand operations were EU police and numerous "training" or "consultative" missions aimed at creating modern and professional state security forces in unstable regions. Although formally the European Union is only a subregional international organization, in practice the EU does not consider it necessary to legitimize its own interventions into conflicts through UN mechanisms. Operations and missions are conducted on the basis of the European Council's own policy decisions. However, the EU does not conduct openly coercive military-political missions on its own, leaving decisions on them to the UN Security Council. The article analyzes the structure, types, purposes of several dozen programs of military-technical and military-political cooperation implemented by the European Union within the framework of the EU Permanent Structured Cooperation Program (PESCO). The author structurally subdivides PESCO programs into groups: structures and means of joint crisis response, militaryinfrastructure programs, naval initiatives, programs in information and communication and cyber-spheres, logistics and military-medical programs, military-training programs. The content of each group's programs is reviewed in detail. The article substantiates the conclusion that the implementation of the currently announced PESCO programs will strengthen mostly the EU's marginal (background) capabilities in operations and missions under the Common Security and Defense Policy. PESCO does not actually include programs directly aimed at any drastic improvement of capability for missions and operations in crisis and conflict regions outside the EU.

AB How can technologies affect human nature? If the nature of human beings changes, one wonders: in which direction? These problems are actively discussed today by philosophers, sociologists and political scientists, representatives of religious denominations, etc. One of the points of view, which can be conditionally called "anthropomorphic", boils down to the fact that the combination of man and machine is unacceptable, as this leads to anti-humanism, and one must follow the path of improving the Human Body."Transhumanists" or "posthumanists", on the other hand, say that everything that can be done must be done and progress cannot be stopped. The point of compromise is to comply with the "red line": to prohibit reproductive cloning, but to allow the use of biotechnologies, for example, to treat people. The article also tried to implement a kind of menta experiment and to evaluate the technological trends indicated from the position of the ancient philosophers, manly Socrates and Plato. The authors suggest that ancient philosophers could give ambiguous assessments.

AB The article examines the transformation of power groups in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia during the period 1990.2019: from the proclamation of independence of the Baltic states and the dismantling of the previous ruling institutions to the formation of a new political order by the elites. The objective is to identify the main factors of transformation of the channels and mechanisms for the recruiting of power groups and to determine the general and specific features of this process, to correlate them with the key decisions of the elites that have determined political priorities of the Baltic states. In order to quantitatively analyze changes in the composition of the elites, data from open sources on the background of 886 political figures in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia were assessed. Up to 53% of evaluated cases are representatives of parliaments, 40% are members of governments, 7% are presidents and their advisers, meanwhile, 252 cases are from Lithuania, 271. from Estonia and 363. from Latvia (the greater number of registered parliamentary electoral cycles - 9- were registered in Latvia, along with 7 in Lithuania and 8 in Estonia). The analysis is based on parliamentary electoral cycles due to the parliaments decisive role in the political systems of the Baltic countries in accordance with the Constitution. The transformation of the power groups in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia took place in a similar political and historical context. However, it is not correct to talk about a single "Baltic elite" as a community of power groups of the three countries consolidated at the interstate level. The general features of the transformation of power groups in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia along with the peculiarities inherent in each country are revealed. Thus, among the elite of Estonia there are the fewest number of representatives of the ex-nomenklatura, Latvia is the leader in the number of proteges of business in power, Lithuania ranked first in terms of the number of politicians with foreign origins. Today, the Baltic states elites more often act like competitors than like-minded people, although they retain elements of political coordination, in particular, dealing with Russia.

DT Article
DE "smart city"; citizen participation; comparative analysis; smart
   technologies; innovations; political risks
AB The article is devoted to a comparative study of three European cities - Barcelona, London and Amsterdam - in forming the socio-political concept of a "smart city", whereas they have achieved the greatest success in this area in recent years. The criteria for the comparative analysis are: the availability of a range of modern electronic public services; increasing citizens' participation in politics using digital technology; opportunities, problems and risks in the formation of e-democracy (including cybercrime, the lack of a legal framework that enshrines citizens' rights to initiatives in electronic decision-making, a high percentage of elderly citizens poorly adapted to new technologies, etc.). The methodology of the research is interdisciplinary: it is conducted at the intersection of political science, communication, sociology, cultural and urban studies. The main challenges and problems of the three cities on their way to "smart city" formation were: aging of the population (the problem of educating senior citizens on digital technologies); the growth of cybercrime (distrust of the digital technology reliability); the lack of a legal framework for the wide use of digital technology in political practice. A critical analysis of the European experience shows that the neglect of challenges and risks, especially of the legislative framework and the fight against cybercrime, initially was the main mistake made when implementing the "smart city" concept. It is shown that the next stage in the development of this concept should be the legislative consolidation of the status of city residents as a subject of politics and management in electronic decision-making.

TI BASIC INCOME IN SOME NORDIC COUNTRIES: THEORY AND PRACTICE
SO MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE unconditional basic income; unemployment; unemployment benefits;
   experiment; Denmark; Finland
AB The article describes development of the idea of unconditional basic income in some Nordic countries. There were active discussions in the early 1980s and in 1992-1994 in Denmark and experiment was conducted on the introduction of unconditional basic income in Finland in 2017-2018. Basic income has never been seriously considered in Denmark on a practical level. For the first time, interest in basic income arose in Denmark in the 1980s. Once again, the issue of basic income was on the official policy agenda in 1992-1994, when there was extensive discussion on this issue. In many ways, these debates were associated with the development of the system of unemployment benefits in the country at that time and a number of economic, institutional and political circumstances. The idea of basic income was considered as a fatal blow, either too controversial or unrealistic, showing that it would require considerable money. Thus, by the mid-1990s, this idea was categorically rejected and disappeared forever from the agenda in Denmark. The unconditional basic income in Finland has been discussed for the last 10 years. It was believed that due to the mass robotization and the introduction of artificial intelligence, a huge number of people would lose their jobs in the future, and the universal basic income will force people to accept temporary contract work which ultimately will increase labor mobility and efficiency. By the classical definition unconditional basic income is the regular payment of a certain amount of money to each member of the community without checking the financial situation or the need to do work. The experiment with unconditional basic income in Finland did not fully meet this definition. First, only the unemployed could take part in it. Secondly, the experiment participants continued to receive benefits from other support systems. The authorities decided to focus on the unemployed in order to understand whether unconditional basic income encourages employment. The 2,000 citizens selected by lottery were unemployed, poor, and were between the ages of 25 and 58 years old. They received 560 euros per month, while the payment did not stop even after they found a job. Intermediate results of the experiment were almost completely opposite to the expected. Requests of recipients of basic income to the labor market have only increased. They said they were not ready to grab any job, and made more and more demands. Both for employers and for trade unions such an outcome was an unpleasant surprise. The preliminary results of the experiment with an unconditional basic income showed that in the first year participants in the experiment were looking for a little more actively than other unemployed people. Although the Finnish authorities did not officially comment on anything, all the experts said that the two-year tests showed the project's inconsistency. First, the "free" money was in fact an unconditional unemployment benefit, that is, there was nothing new in the proposed version of the universal basic income. Secondly, the government did not conceal that the experiment with the basic income was not aimed at reducing the number of the poor or fighting inequality - its main task was "promoting employment". If all citizens received unconditional basic income, additional social spending would be about 5% of GDP. This is a lot, even taking into account the fact that Finland spends about 30% of GDP on social spending. A universal basic income can only be successful if provided on a continuous and universal basis.
   But it requires a lot of money and higher taxes which most people disagree with.

AB The aim of the research is to study thematic and lexical-semantic features of Russian-European borrowings in the Tatar-Russian dictionaries of the 19-th century. The object of the study is the lexicographic sources of the 19-th century, namely the Tatar-Russian dictionaries by I. Giganov (1801), A. Troyansky (1835), N. Ostroumov (1892), K. Nasyri (1878), M. Yunusov (1900). The study used linguistic descriptive, comparative-historical, comparative methods and partially the techniques of etymological analysis. The thematic range is quite diverse and covers various socio-political, socio-cultural and everyday spheres: household items: munchala, ponar; names of buildings: matcha, mich; agricultural items: bitch, kamyt; educational supplies: card, vacation; military vocabulary: drushka, pristul; the vocabulary related to the financial sector: cash desk, bank; legal terms: shtrau, sunt.The invariability, stability and preservation of most lexical units in the modern language suggests that the most frequent words were recorded in these lexicographic monuments of the period under study, i.e. the main lexical fund of the Tatar language with Russian-European borrowings.

Still others believe that GR sa new approach to poltical management. However, it cannot be denied that this area is gaining weight, evolving, and forming a research conceptual model. in this paper, an analysis and assessment of existing approaches to the definition of the GR concept by Russian and foreign poltical scientists are carried out. An author's definition of GR was put forward based on an understanding of the main goal of interaction between business actors and public authorities. in particular, GR is understood as the activity of representatives of large business actors in building sustainable relations with government to achieve competitive advantages and create favorable conditions for their own economic activities.

AB After the end of the Cold War, the number of books and articles written about Russia dropped greatly, with writing on its economy falling particularly sharply. How Russian workers perceive their wages relative to countries they compare themselves with is one important component of their contentment and perception of well-being, which play such important roles in determining a country's political economy and economic development. This article draws on Russian statistical sources to add to the meager English-language empirical literature on Russian wages. Statically, it presents their level and inequality relative to the natural comparison countries. Dynamically, it presents their growth, and changes in inequality. The conclusion summarizes the seriously problematic situation of wages in Russia, and presents two political economic conclusions these empirical results suggest.

AB The authors consider the actual role of data science, big data, and artificial intelligence in the system of contemporary education, primarily in open educational practices. The authors put forward and test the hypothesis that data science and artificial intelligence can and should be not only objects of study but also new tools of educational activity at first hand. Moreover, these tools should be used by students themselves for complete and systematic selection of their study materials and for the formation of personal strategies. The authors relied on materials that describe the direct use of elements of data science and artificial intelligence in the educational process (reports, interviews, etc.), on descriptions of prospective digital developments that can be re-oriented toward educational problems, on educational technologies that can become prototypes for developments in the field of data science and artificial intelligence. The following methods were used in the research: content analysis, systemgenetic and structural-content analysis, modeling of cognitive and social processes, forecasting. The study was conducted in the following mode: (1) research on basic theoretical ideas about data science and artificial intelligence, as well as ideas about their actual and potential social and sociocultural effects; (2) a primary study of practices of using these disciplines in the education system; (3) building of a hypothetical model of educational practice based on data science and artificial intelligence; (4) selection and analysis of materials about existing educational practices based on large amounts of data and complex software; (5) assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of existing digital educational resources; (6) modeling/forecasting of possible and necessary digital educational tools based on data science and artificial intelligence. As a result, the following conclusions were made: (1) currently, data science and artificial intelligence are being mastered in the Russian school in the mode of abstract knowledge, without instrumentalization; (2) objectively, data-driven and AI-driven educational complexes can be created that allow students to replace textbooks by constructing sets of materials on standardized educational topics, as well as educational simulators that support students' decisions about educational and life strategies in changing conditions; (3) currently, data analysis and artificial intelligence are used to organize educational activities and students' self-determination only at the level of separate components: search engines, educational navigators, machine learning-based applications that process student training data, simulators of meta-subject competencies, tools for analyzing students' psycho-social traits, etc.

DE biocultural co-constructivism; musical-auditory patterns; a priori;

ID EVOLUTION
AB From the perspective of the biocultural co-constructivism concept, the article deals with the phenomenon of musical auditory perception. The main claim is that culture excites certain musical and artistic auditory patterns which are fixed in brain structures, play a crucial role in cognitive processes associated with musical creativity, and turn out to be important components of the holistic system "brain - society - culture", especially in the initial stages of human development. These patterns play the role of pre-language in the process of ontogenesis. They act as prerequisites for the perception of reality, the understanding of nature and mechanisms whose functioning is possible in the format of Kant's ideas related to apriorism in the context of modern neuroscience, bearing in mind the transcendentalism of the activity type as well. The authors claim the crucial role of musical auditory imprinting in the accumulation of initial musical-auditory associations-genetically prewired programs. The authors suggest that musical auditory imprinting explains the formation of ethnic musical modules, as well as primary musical auditory preferences. They discuss the nature of innate neural mechanisms that provide, when perceiving sound intonations, interaction with the accumulated supply of musical auditory intonations of the language, genetically innate programs-a kind of "implicit knowledge" with prosodic and musical intonations of a certain ethnic group. These innate neural mechanisms that make possible not only to realize belonging to a certain ethnic group but to interpret music as a mechanism of a meaningful and "directed" cognitive process that shapes a person as a representative of a certain culture as well. The authors provide arguments for the key thesis of modern neuroesthetics, according to which it is the musical abilities of a person from the whole set of types of artistic abilities that largely determine the degree of effectiveness of the work of intelligence, as well as almost all of cognitive functions.

DE image of Vladimir Putin; Spiegel; Crimea; demonization; trend;
   opponents; Putin understanders; skeptics
AB At the beginning of 2012, the journalists of Der Spiegel, predicting a difficult third presidential term for Vladimir Putin, focused on the home political situation in Russia, on protest moods and rallies in Moscow and St. Petersburg. But in 2014 the focus of their interest shifted to the field of Russia's foreign policy, which began to play the role of the dominant factor in constructing the image of the Russian president in one of the most important information and political magazines in Germany and Europe. The article aims to identify trends in the evolution of the external image of Vladimir Putin in the weekly Der Spiegel in the context of the most important events of the Ukrainian crisis, first of all, the inclusion of Crimea to Russia, which played a special role in the evolution of the image of the Russian president, setting the vector of foreign policy assessments as the determining factor in the design of this image. On the materials of Der Spiegel, different positions are considered in relation to Russia in the post-Crimean period in Europe and the world. Based on these positions, the author identifies three wings with variations characterizing the components of Putin's image: opponents, "Putin understanders", and skeptics. If the first wing focuses on the personal qualities and cultural-symbolic elements of the image of the Russian president in a negative perspective, sometimes in an extremely unflattering form, the second one emphasizes Putin's realism and "sober" approach to the role in neutralizing fears of Russia's neighbors about the country's expansionist aspirations. Skeptics are represented mainly by Jakob Augstein, the columnist and co-owner of Der Spiegel, who is very critical in his assessment of the Western policy towards Russia, its tendency to demonize the image of the president, and attempts to shift the responsibility for all the world evil to him. Considering all the three positions contributes to forming a clear view of the image of the head of the Russian Federation in the weekly in various projections and thus to moving beyond the established idea that the Western media only demonize his image: anyway, this is not about Der Spiegel.

DE alienation; burnout syndrome; authenticity
AB The problem of alienation retains its significance and relevance in modern reality, where a serious specificity of the professional world is observed. Karl Marx was the first to relate alienation and production (professional) activity. Alienation as a problem and as a category is also received from Marx. He proceeded from the socioeconomic character of alienation, and therefore linked it to labor (professional) activity. He also investigated the confrontation of a person forced to live in a capitalist production that gives rise to the problem of alienation. The post-industrial era, characterized by changes in social reality with an obvious utilitarian, pragmatic and technocratic orientation, actualizes the interrelation of alienation and the burnout syndrome. Alienation in the modern professional world is the burnout syndrome associated with the onset of a sense of professional inauthenticity and existential emptiness. The burnout syndrome is a process of alienation, which gradually manifests itself at the basic levels of professional existence: alienation at the internal level, alienation at the external level, alienation at the professional level. The person's alienation of personal qualities that led them to professional activity is a burnout syndrome at the internal level. The alienation of their own professional status in society is defined as a professional burnout at the external level. The alienation from the competencies that the specialist has acquired is referred to as a burnout syndrome at the professional level. Alienation as the burnout syndrome is a combination of all levels of alienation in the profession, which in their unity and conditionality form the process. The burnout syndrome as a process of alienation compels a person to turn to an independent search for oneself, to search for one's own authenticity. The burnout syndrome is a manifestation of the non-authenticity of being. The specialist carries out his activities functionally, only in the "present" mode, comprehends professional activities in the context of surrounding things. An independent search for oneself will allow a person to remove the burnout syndrome as a kind of alienation.

TI MORALITY AND CAPITALISM: DEPLETION OF THE FREE RESOURCE?

DT Article
DE capitalism; morality; commodity; commodification; neoliberalism
AB The article analyzes some aspects of the position of morality regarding political, philosophical, religious, and scientific discourses devoted to capitalism. The paradoxical situation of these discourses is that they describe moral values simultaneously as a commodity and a non-commodity. On the one hand, exclusion of morality from the market is one of the key conditions for the development of capitalism, and not only in the sense that it removes moral barriers in pursuit of profit. It also means the transfer of morality into the category of a free resource. This resource is actually present on the market as a cost factor, but is pronouncedly ignored, not considered. On the other hand, for the ideological and scientific discourses that analyze capitalist societies in a global historical context, the picture is completely different. Here we face the actual recognition of the enormous monetary value of certain moral values. The authors of these discourses almost openly describe morality, whose price is ignored at the level of ideology "for internal use", as a source of value. Overall, the authors recognize that morality is paid indirectly at the global level, being the source of a kind of a moral-imperialist rent. In conclusion, the author of the article raises the question: will a similar paradoxical attitude to morality continue in ideological discourses that legitimize capitalism? He suggests that in the foreseeable future most of the dominant political, economic, and scientific discourses will recognize moral marketability. One can see the consideration of some trends in the field of economics and ideology, testifying to the actual recognition of morality as a commodity, i.e. to the depletion of morality as a "free resource". Political consequences of this can be quite ambitious: if morality has not only value but also price, this implies a moral right of workers to demand payment "for everything".

   of historicity; evolution of poststructuralism
AB The aim of this article is to study the connections between the works of two famous French philosophers: Michel Foucault (1926-1978) and Cornelius Castoriadis (1922-1997) on the subject of the philosophy of history. The author tries to prove that behind methodological differences of the both works there are substantial differences on the subject of the ontology of history and its mechanisms. Scholars, such as Marcela Tovar-Restrepo, often compare the both works regarding the connections between subjectivity and power existing in the works of the both thinkers. The question in this study is about the objective conflicts functioning behind their methodological analyses. The investigations lead to the following results: (1) Castoriadis's methodology of the philosophy of history is opposed to that of Foucault not only by his interest to existentialist Marxism, but also by the acceptance of the transhistorical triad "soul-language-object" in the place of Foucault's trans-historical triad "language - work - life"; (2) Castoriadis's ontology of history opposes to that of Foucault by the introduction of the trans-historical conflict "autonomy-heteronomy" in the place of Foucault's trans-historical conflict "(universalist) theology-spirituality". In this sense, the advantage of the both authors is that they include into history some "semantic dimension", the ways and techniques of doing something, specific for a period of time. In fact, Castoriadis radically opposes the both ontological dimensions of history: the "legein", i.e. logical determination, dominating in the Occidental mind and the "teukhein", i.e. different techniques. And Foucault sees their differences clearly, writing histories and genealogies of different techniques, but he never opposes techniques to the power or science. Finally, the problem is not that Foucault can represent a risk to Castoriadis's autonomy (Caumiere), but that the both authors describe history in the pure opposition to speculativism and determinism, just forgetting about its moral dimension.

DE structure of geopolitics; ethno-politology; geo-ethno-politology;
   ethno-politics; geo-ethno-politics
AB Geopolitics as a scientific discipline has a complex structure. It can be differentiated by actual human environments, by virtual environments people create themselves, by the object of research and the environment in which the object of research manifests itself, by research models, and by subdisciplines. The article considers one of the structural components of geopolitics, geo-ethnopolitology, and shows its difference from the science of ethno-politology. The terms "geo-ethnopolitics" and "ethno-politics" are explained as a practical use of the developments of the disciplines of geo-ethno-politology and ethno-politology in political life. The authors define geo-ethno-politology as the science of the division of the world between ethnoses, races, and nations, their origin, settlement on the Earth's surface, arrangement on different continents, in different geographical and climatic zones. They note that ethno-politics originated when there was a need to regulate the relationship of different ethnic groups and among themselves with the help of the state, that is, in the empires of the Ancient world. Geo-ethno-politics as a political practice is younger than ethno-politics. It appeared when the "world closed off', the Earth's surface was completely populated. It is designed to solve the problem of dividing and redeviding the world between ethnoses, races, and nations. The content of geo-ethnopolitology is the study of the role and place of ethnic groups, races, and nations in world politics, their interaction with each other and with the leading powers, the study of the resulting alignment of ethnopolitical forces and the configuration of the global ethno-political system. The content of geo-ethnopolitics is the activity on the settlement of ethno-political conflicts, on changing the ethno-political map of the world. The authors analyze factors in the development of geo-ethno-politology and ethnopolitology: the emergence of new states as a result of the First and Second World Wars; the formation of ethno-national identity and ethno-nations; the emergence of the United Nations which formulated the right of nations to self-determination; decolonization; the breakup of Yugoslavia, the USSR, and Czechoslovakia; the intensification of ethno-nationalist and separatist movements in European countries and other regions of the world; the failure of the policy of multiculturalism; the cessation of ethnic and cultural assimilation, ethnic and religious tolerance; the growth of ethnic migration to Europe and America; the growth of riots and crimes on ethnic grounds, etc. Geo-ethno-politology has static and dynamic components. The static component of geo-ethno-politology studies the existing correlation of ethno-political forces and the geo-ethno-political picture of the world. The dynamic component of geo-ethno-politology studies the ethno-political processes that change this picture, geo-ethno-political conflicts, and changes in geo-ethno-political indicators.

AB The article examines the features of the political consciousness and behavior of women as a social group. The author outlines the contradictions between the social and political practices of women, the exclusion and stigmatization of women's participation in political life, which can lead to the absenteeism of this social group. Researchers should take into account the increasing tendencies of gender asymmetry in the structure of the population, the persistence of gender inequalities in the economic and political sphere, the growth of sociocultural risks; therefore, the issue of women's political consciousness and behavior requires a careful study. The aim of this article is to determine the sociocultural foundations of the specifics of women's political consciousness and behavior. The author proceeds from the scientific position that the social status of women and its changes are closely related to changes in their political consciousness. The emergence of specific interests demanded through the institution of politics should be considered as the starting point in women's political consciousness. At the same time, women's political consciousness takes shape at the initial stage in solving everyday issues of private life, organizing and arranging localized territories, and changing situations in relation to women. The methodological basis of the study is a sociocultural approach. Based on the theoretical analysis of the works and monitoring results of the World Values Survey, the author identifies the following sociocultural grounds of the specifics of women's political consciousness and behavior: the recent experience of women's social and managerial participation in political life; the specifics of the formation of women's social and human capital; inclusion in the private sphere, which creates a special form of sociopolitical interaction for women. At the present stage, this is reflected in women's political consciousness and behavior. Despite women's growing interest in politics, it is general and not always clearly expressed. The lack of resources and the narrowness of the formal channels of women's influence on political processes can lead to a distortion of the needs and motives of their political behavior. The need to address socially significant issues and to combine specific women's interests with the interests of specific communities, the state, and society creates opportunities for women to participate in public associations. At the same time, such public associations are becoming an instrument for changing women's political consciousness.

AB On the basis of archival materials and scientific literature, the article examines the history of agro-engineering education in the USSR during the global socio-economic and political transformations of the 1920s - 1930s. The article shows the importance of radical restructuring of the entire system of vocational education in accordance with the first Five-Year Plans. Presented are the major normative documents regulating the organization and further development of agricultural engineering universities. It is noted that the establishment of educational institutions took into account the specifics of soil and climatic zones, so that agricultural engineering universities would produce specialists familiar with the characteristics of the soil, climate, landscape of the respective zone, and able to work with equipment designed for the particular region. Between 1930 and 1941, nine ago-engineering universities were created, each designed with an eye for the regional specifics. The article highlights the key features of the formation of agro-engineering education, which consists in the use of local resources (primarily human and material) and of the technical base of industrial enterprises and advanced Sovkhoz state farms. The authors come to the conclusion that the creation of specialized higher educational institutions to train engineers for agricultural production became an urgent need as the collectivization of agriculture and the industrialization of production was unfolding; it established a powerful foundation for the further development of agricultural engineering education, of science, and of agricultural machine production in our country.

DE social system; singularity; network structure; network; rhizome
AB Today, we are witnessing a spontaneous bifurcation in comprehending the essence of the social system. Bringing man back into the hub of the universe opened up an opportunity for them to build their own reality characterized by otherness and competing with the predetermined conditions developed as influenced by the specific features of the social machine functioning. The four-hundred-year period of social myths and revolutionary upheavals results in a natural implosion - a collapse of the social and the cultural "inward", to a person with their spiritual world. We see the development of objective conditions for an intuitive change in social axiomatics in favor of a network of singular "desiring-machines" as a dissipative system. The article attempts to determine the potentially possible topological outcomes of network "singularity"-its vertical "tower-shaped" or horizontal "areal" temporal orientation in their historical interconnections. It distinguishes between the concepts of network and network structure. The latter is always singular and hierarchical since it is determined by a certain "organizing" origin. For many years, hierarchical relationship models have truly served humanity, helping the authorities at all levels develop fairly stable social formations with preset parameters. Today, the structural dominance of hierarchies is seriously limiting the stretch of human imagination. The liberation of social practices from different kinds of regulatory principles substantially expands a person's space for creative construction of their own identity and the identity of others. We see the developing prerequisites for a regular, although intuitive, change in public axiomatics in favor of a network, considered as a set of multiple connections between its nodes - "desiring-machines". Multiplicity is well described by Deleuze's concept "rhizome", which should be considered as network ontology. Deleuze's rhizomatic optics gives us a chance to take a new look at the role of man as a "desiring-machine", since their internal, timeless development starts playing a key role in understanding the true existential essence and potential of the network axiomatics of sociality. The future of the network is human thoughts, emotions, and actions.

ID HIERARCHICAL APPROACH; PARADOX
AB The article critically examines the heuristic capacity and methods of using separate tools of Wittgenstein's philosophical grammar to treat various semantic pathologies (paradoxes of Liar, Truth-Teller, etc.). According to Wittgenstein, philosophical confusion associated with the analysis of such semantic pathologies arises on the grounds of our intuitive faith that we are able to express in language any property that interests us. For instance, we believe that the property "to have a length of exactly one metre" can be meaningfully attributed to any extended object. However, such a faith is fundamentally wrong, since an object like a standard metre, which plays an exclusive role as the criterion of length in our measuring practices based on the metric system, is an example of an extended object about which one can say neither that it is one metre long, nor that it is not one metre long. A correct understanding of the language-game concept shows that the criterion by which we form a set of objects that meet the standards established by the criterion cannot be described in the same way as objects of this set. Language-games using predicates of truth and falsehood are similar to our practice of measuring length using the metric system. In cases of Liar and Truth-Teller sentences, we encounter resembling examples of philosophical confusion. Beyond the context of their usage, "This sentence is false" and "This sentence is true" sentences seem to us paradoxes. But, according to Wittgenstein's philosophical grammar, a correct method of treating such "paradoxical" sentences demands to find the lacking context for their usage, i.e. pay attention to the language-game in which they are emplloyed. Like in the case of the standard metre, we can claim that the sentence "This sentence is false" ("This sentence is true") is neither false (true), nor not false (true). In an analogous way, Liar and Truth-Teller sentences should be interpreted as peculiar standards of falsehood and truth that we use in our language-games to judge about the truth value of other sentences.

DE implicit philosophical premises; frequency interpretation; subjectivist
   interpretation; Bernoulli's theorem; stability of frequencies
AB The article examines the implicit philosophical premises in mathematical battles. It focuses on the critique of Kolmogorov's conditions, which are minimally represented in the known literature. The conditions are significant in the frequency interpretation, in the illustration of the thesis on the underestimation of philosophical ideas, and in the historical context. The main methodological question that guided the study is whether we can agree with subjectivists that Kolmogorov's requirement of the proximity of probability and frequency is described by the conclusion of Bernoulli's theorem. To answer this question, the requirements were formulated for using the theorem within the frequency approach, in which the theoretical probability of success of the tests, used in Bernoulli's theorem, is unknown and is constant by hypothesis. Using the fact and making no pretense to the generality of reasoning, the author assumed that, like in many real processes, the frequency characteristics of events occurring with constant probability turn out to be stable. In the simplest case, frequencies are stable if their values belong to an interval whose length is less than the measurement error. Here, any value from the interval is suitable as probability, and the requirement is satisfied. Thus, describing the conditions for the application of the theorem within the frequency approach, the author obtained a geometric interpretation of the requirement. The requirement turns out to be a consequence of the stability of frequencies; stability is an ontological characteristic of the world of experience, and it is a prerequisite for the application of the theorem, not its conclusion. If Kolmogorov can be viewed as a consistent representative of the frequency approach, then his requirement does not depend on the theorem. However, as the author has shown, he declared himself a follower of Mises for pragmatic reasons. Therefore, it can be assumed that his requirement is described by the conclusion of the theorem. Nevertheless, within the frequency approach, the bases for the application of the theorem in the subjectivist interpretation are rejected; therefore, Kolmogorov's condition does not depend on the theorem.

DE Turkey; Justice and Development Party; Islamic bourgeoisie; MUSIAD;
   TUSIAD
AB The Pro-Islamic Justice and Development Party (AKP), which has been ruling in Turkey since 2002, represents the interests of a significant part of the Turkish society that has long been in implicit opposition to secular reforms of the Republican period. Thus, when the AKP came to power, there was a moment of revenge for the conservative part of society and a certain weakening of the secular Republicans' position. But the division of the Turkish society into two roughly equal groups creates not so much a balance of stability - it rather keeps the possibility of a reverse transition of power to more secular political forces. However, the AKP's period of rule has lasted for almost 20 years. Therefore, it can be assumed that the phenomenon of the Party's political longevity is based on certain mechanisms. One of them is an active process of creating the big national business loyal to the Party. The AKP came to power as a party of small and medium-sized Anatolian entrepreneurs, while the big capital located in the Western part of the country traditionally supported the center-right secular parties and did not hide its rejection of the AKP as a ruling party. However, close interaction with the big national capital occupies an important place in the long-term strategic plans of the AKP government. As a result, it was possible to provide it in two ways: first, by winning a partial loyalty of the "old" big capital; second, and more important, by active efforts to create a "new" big capital (loyal to the new government) through privatization and transfer of state orders to companies closely connected with the Party on preferential terms. Some statistical assessments on identifying positions of the so called Islamic business in the midst of the largest Turkish companies have allowed the authors to specify that the policy of "nurturing", or rather "bringing up" to a bigger bourgeoisie loyal to the ruling AKP, is yielding results.

AB After the collapse of the united Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, the so-called "Macedonian question" was considered the strongest constraining and destabilizing factor to integration processes in the Balkans in general and the post-Yugoslav space in particular. It was an unsolvable problem in the bilateral relations between Greece and the neighboring Macedonia (recently known as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM). The main value of the problem is that the Greek side considered it unlawful and immoral to use its historical, cultural and linguistic features by the current Slavic state for its own purposes, which could create sufficient preconditions for separatist manifestations not only in Greece but also in Bulgaria. Furthermore, the use of ancient symbols by the Macedonian side as its state insignia (for example, the Vergina Sun, official language or citizenship) provoked resistance from the Greeks. In addition, the unresolved Macedonian question blocked Skopje's entry into the North-Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Union structures. The Greek government was able to enlist the support of not only the local population, but also its main partners among the EU and NATO member states. A long-awaited GreekMacedonian agreement was signed near the Prespa border lake after lengthy and thorough negotiations in the summer of 2018. Undoubtedly, it was the result of a compromise solution on the main issues causing mutual discontent. As the Prespa Agreement outcome, the Republic of North Macedonia appeared on the political map of Europe in February 2019. In fact, immediately after the Prespa Agreement conclusion, a serious impetus and breakthrough were given not only to continue mutually beneficial cooperation between the Hellenic Republic and the North Macedonia, but also to intensify the negotiation process for Skopje's accession to the NATO already in March 2020 and the European Union on an earlier date.

DE Aleksandr Kunitsyn; natural law; idea of legal justice; Russian
   philosophy of law
AB The liberal idea and the sequent idea of legal justice were stated and introduced largely owing to the name of Aleksandr Kunitsyn, who was an advocate of natural law. According to Kunitsyn, legal justice is determined by the presence or absence of such essential legal principles as the recognition of the inherent value of a human person and the priority of human liberty, rights, and responsibilities over any other values. Kunitsyn related liberty, justice, and subjective rights with legal obligations and interaction based on equality. These ideas have been more or less accepted by representatives of the latest Russian "revived" natural law. The combination of the liberal and traditional (in relation to power) intentions makes it possible to refer Kunitsyn's law conceptions to the conservative/mild/reasonable natural law. Kunitsyn was not the creator of a new law theory. He tried to impart ideas which could release people from oppression and alter the political form of state in Russia. He was inspired by the ideas of liberty and fight against tyranny. He inspired the others with these ideas. According to Kunitsyn, the doctrine of law or legal philosophy formulates laws derived from the nature of the human mind. Evidently, such conclusions have to be based on the methodology unknown in the times of Kunitsyn. However, the human-centric concept itself preserves its scientific and philosophic significance nowadays with regard for the necessity of its modern interpretation. According to the post-classical interpretation, both human liberty (self-ownership) and the freedom of human will are still a condition of normal interaction and realization of human potential by everyone. Equality in endowing with liberty and justice are important as well. They are considered as cooperation that determines our solidarity through joint exercising of mutual rights and responsibilities. However, the human-centric legal philosophy in Russia has had its critics from the times of Kunitsyn till the current time of post-perestroika. The ideas of liberty, human rights, respect for human dignity, opposition to tyranny and autonomous power of the rulers have never been hardwired in the legal consciousness of the people. The main task of today's Russian legal philosophy is to acknowledge and affirm the ideas of human liberty and dignity in public legal consciousness as it is impossible to talk about legal justice itself without these principles.

AB The article analyzes the relationship between environmental consciousness and scientific paradigms in the different periods of Western civilization's development. The peculiarities of the influence of classical, non-classical and post-non-classical science on the types of environmental consciousness characteristic of modern and postmodern societies are studied. The idea of the existence of a connection between the logical and philosophical attitudes of the New European (classical) science and the formation of the principles of anthropocentric environmental consciousness that have ensured the formation of the anthropogenic civilization is proved. It is determined that, within the framework of the non-classical paradigm, the theoretical and philosophical foundations of the ecocentric model of environmental consciousness are beginning to take shape. In the post-non-classical era, the model of ecocentrism and worldview orientations directed to the development of the strategy for the safe interaction of nature and man is being formed on the basis of the theories of postmodernism and under the influence of modern cognitive practices. The influence of ontological and epistemological attitudes dominating within the framework of scientific paradigms on the formation of principles of nature management in anthropocentric and ecocentric systems of ecological consciousness is traced.

AB The article is dedicated to the impact of the COVID-19 on the political system of Italy. The analysis includes the decision-making process in a state of emergency, the character of political communication and the new practices of emergency power, which arose during the pandemic and can influence the subsequent evolution of the Italian political system. Two levels of power relations (sovereignty) have been identified where the most significant changes have occurred: those are state - society relations and centre - regions relations. The pandemic has augmented the role of the executive branch in the decision-making process and of the informal negotiation practices within the elites, has led to a decrease in the role of representative institutions, and to an increase in conflict relations between the center and the regions. The author comes to the conclusion that the emerging trends will entail a new phase of the negotiation between the political forces on the issue of a transformation of the political system.

DE Spatial development; Pacific vector of development; Geopolitical
   relations; Great Powers
AB The article considers spatial aspects of the formation and transformation of the Russian-American geopolitical relations in the Northern Pacific. It is established that the spatial development of Russia and the US in the 17th - 19th centuries towards the Pacific Ocean occurred almost simultaneously. The stages of the spatial development of these countries during the specified period are allocated. The pacific policy of Russia and the US was built on mutual support for a long period of time. In many cases, it was based on the joint opposition to hegemonic ambitions of Great Britain, including military support to each other during the Crimean War (1853 - 1856) and the American Civil War (1861-1865). Gained trust in allied relations and hope on their stability promoted transfer by Russia of its American assets to the United States (Fort Ross in California and Alaska). However, from the end of the 19th century, the Russian-American geopolitical relations gradually took a turn for the worse. Later, their relations have deteriorated even more after the establishment of the Soviet political system in Russia. This phenomenon has received a pause only in the years of joint struggle against the German and Japanese aggression. Nevertheless, the relations of geopolitical rivalry between Russia (then the USSR) and the US had no mutual spatial claims. However, Mikhail Gorbachev's course to 'new political thinking' has allowed the US to annex the vast sector of the Bering Sea (Baker-Shevardnadze Agreement, 1990).

DE media text; author and addressee of online media; interpretative work;
   online commentary; sociopolitical context
AB The article presents the results of studying the interpretative activities of the participants in a network media discourse on the material of the media texts of the online newspaper Kommersant. The conceptual foundations of the news media text are characterized; its interpretative potential, realized in the comments, is revealed. The possibilities of the interpreting activities of media recipients in the context of Internet communication are described. Determinants are identified that affect commenting on the stimulus media text. The interdisciplinary nature of the study is due to the combination of the linguistic analysis of the media material in a communicative aspect with a political science commentary, which allows evaluating the interpretative activity of the recipients of the network media taking into account the broad sociopolitical context. The methodology of complex linguistic analysis is applied here to a qualitatively new material-media texts of online media, which have a number of distinctive features in comparison with texts of print media. Still, the requirement of "communication and interaction between the media and the audience" is the basis of interactivity in the media and remains unchanged. In this regard, the structural-logical and semantic organization of the network media text, as well as the printed one, is focused on the addressee factor and subsequently becomes the basis for its interpretation in Internet comments. The interpretative potential of media texts is determined by a number of components, among which the author of the media text traditionally plays the leading role as the initiator of communication that sets the vector of the text's interpretation by potential readers. The interpretative activity of the recipients is determined by the stimulus text (its content, conceptual structure, completeness and sequence of its implementation by the author, explicitly and implicitly expressed author's position in relation to the described content). The content of online comments, however, is broader than the content of the interpreted text. The commenting persons rely not only on the original media text, but also on the assessment of the socio-communicative context in which it functions. Such "pretext determinants" in the comments are ideologemes of the recent past, the desire of users to be included in the "commentator" function on important sociopolitical issues, and comments can be both "professional" or simply assessing: the former generally rely on the analysis of the semantic blocks of the stimulus text, while the latter are limited to evaluative statements, often typical, characteristic of Internet communication in general. Based on the semantic blocks of the stimulus text, the authors of Internet comments introduce new topics for discussion, thereby expanding the semantic hypertext space of Internet communication.

AB A wide range of topics associated with the challenges of ensuring solid and lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula is considered. The issue of a peace treaty to replace the Armistice Agreement is the cornerstone in building a new nonconfrontational system of relations in Korea that will ensure the security of all parties involved and their equal cooperation. According to the authors, the implementation of these tasks was greatly facilitated by the positive developments achieved in the past year in US-North Korean and inter-Korean relations. At the same time, despite the warming of the general climate, the transition from political declarations to practical steps in the interests of a comprehensive peace settlement turned out to be difficult due to the continuing deep contradictions between the participants in this process. Considerable attention is paid to the position of Russia in the article. It is shown that participation in the peaceful settlement of key Korean problems meets the vital interests of the Russian Federation in the context of the tasks of creating a security and cooperation mechanism in Northeast Asia.

AB The politicization of the linguistic aspect of ethnocultural differences, characteristic of the Spanish "State of autonomies", is reflected in the public discourse of political parties in the context of their language politics. In this article "language politics" is conceptualized as a public articulation of the positions of political parties with regard to the language issue, which is realized in the context of the electoral struggle and embodied in the party manifestos. The article attempts to determine how the nature of the party and electoral dimension of language politics at the level of the Spanish autonomous communities is influenced by the specifics of political parties implementing this politics. The analysis of the texts of the party election programs was chosen as the main research method. As a result of the study, it was determined that the status of the party and its position regarding the political future of the region are related to the depth of their language requirements, and a stable relationship between party ideology and the specificity of language requirements is not traced. In addition, the Catalan and Galician cases showed that the dynamics of language requirements are influenced by the conflict context between the Center and the region (Catalonia) and between parties within the region (Galicia).

DT Article
DE Manchuria; Mongolia; China; nomad population; military activities
AB The article aims to analyse the Russian-Chinese relations through the eyes of the Russian military agents who, at the turn of the 20th century, came to China, Mongolia, Manchuria with military and scientific purposes. Being professional military servicemen, they built their strategy towards China, whose priority was the power pressure on the nearest neighbour. They believed it would clarify the situation with determining the political leader in the Far East. The main sources of the material for the article were military agents' reports published by the Military-Scientific Committee of the General Staff under the "top secret" seal. The reports were complete geographical, geological, economic, ethnographic investigations. Their authors considered any trifle thing to be decisive at war. The authors of the article divided the reports into two groups: those written before the 20th century and in the 20th century. The two events that separate the groups of the reports were the Boxer Rebellion suppressed with the participation of Russia and the Russo-Japanese War which questioned Russian military strength. The latter influenced the intonation of the reports, it became aggressive as military actions were supposed to restore the unsteady Russian prestige. The main issues discussed in the reports were the relief of the future military activity area, fighting efficiency, the Chinese Mongolian tribes' sentiment and their attitude towards Russia. The investigations aimed at clarifying the possibility for Russian forces' movement, the conscripted Mongolian tribes' behavior and their loyalty to the potential conqueror. Examining the military agents' analysis, the authors came to the following conclusions. The military agents considered war activities to be the main means to strengthen Russia's prestige in the East even at the end of 19th century with the public believing the two powers would develop peaceful relations. There was no doubt in Russia's victory in case of a war with China: the Russian army had a high fighting efficiency; China had conflicts with the minor peoples of the Middle Empire. Russia mainly hoped for Mongolia as an ally in the war against China. According to the projects, Mongolia would willingly get rid of the Chinese protection and accept the Russian patronage. The Mongolian Independence Declaration after the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 demanded building a strategy of relations with the new trading partner. In order to force out the rivals from the Mongolian market, Russia had to create a transport infrastructure on its territory, leaving China behind. The construction of the Kyakhta railway branch through Mongolia to Urga, which was to be connected to the Trans-Siberian railway, did not give the economic competitors any chance to dominate in the Mongolian economic area.

DE Iran; GCC; Iran-Saudi relations; Iran-Qatar relations; Iran-Emirate

AB The article examines the development of relations between the Islamic Republic of Iran (IRI) and the member countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). Iran's strained relations with the Arab monarchies of the Gulf are often perceived as their natural state. This implies that a hidden or overt conflict based on deep ideological, political and cultural contradictions is the backbone of the entire complex of relations between Iran and its neighbors in the Persian Gulf However, in reality, the situation looks different. Thus, the current attempts of Riyadh to unite other GCC members against Tehran are only partially successful. While the UAE and Bahrain authorities actively support anti-Iranian steps and rhetoric of the Saudi leadership, Oman, Kuwait and Qatar show considerable interest in maintaining at least neutral good-neighborly relations with Tehran. At the same time, while Doha's desire to develop a dialogue with Iran is largely forced and is due to the fact that without Iranian support, the country can be completely isolated, the interest of the Omani and Kuwaiti leaders in maintaining good relations with Tehran is defined by much deeper, historically determined motives. Moreover, over the past decades, periods of sharp cooling in relations between Iran and all the Arab monarchies of the Persian Gulf region have alternated with active mutual attempts to develop a model that could ensure sustainable cooperation between Iran and the GCC. tinder these circumstances, it makes sense to talk about the existence of at least two conflicting trends in Iranian relations with the GCC countries. On the one hand, the understanding that maintaining a certain level of stability in the Persian Gulf requires establishing good-neighborly relations pushes the leadership of Iran and the GCC countries towards a constructive dialogue. On the other hand, the regional ambitions of Iran and Saudi Arabia inevitably lead to periodic clashes between the two countries in their struggle for influence in the Middle East, inevitably involving other GCC countries in this struggle. The American presence in the region, as well as internal contradictions between the GCC members are additional factors determining specifics of Iran's relation with the Arab monarchies of the Persian Gulf.

AB The aim of the article is to present the state of art in the research related to economic and political aspects of trans-border migration. The paper is based on the overview of recently published monographs that, firstly, reflect typical themes and trends of modern research, secondly, concentrate on structural aspects of migration and not on technical policy-related issues, and thirdly, are characterized by creative formulation of research questions, detailed methodologies, and comprehensive lines of argumentation. On the basis of the overview of those sources, the author of the article draws eight main conclusions. (1) Migration in the current research agenda is largely understood as a process that is intrinsic to modern societies. Such a perspective has led to increasing attention of specialists to economic and social stratification of migrant communities. (2) The publications aim at suggesting arguments to reduce the degree of harshness of the migration situation through the improvement of immigration policies. (3) The researchers specializing in migration studies demonstrate high awareness and use politically correct language, their academic research is characterized by thoroughness. The augmenting importance of international migration forces the researchers to solve serious cognitive and political problems. (4) Modern scientists carefully coin the research methodology that in the majority of cases is predisposed to the use of quantitative methods. (5) The research agenda is subjected to the influence of decisions, programs, research projects of international organizations, especially those of the World Bank and the International Organization for Migration. (6) Today, researchers predominantly tend to develop methodology to explore the current policy-making, and provide policy recommendations in preference to creation of comprehensive theories. (7) The current research generally identifies and analyzes the core problems that arise between institutions and subjects of migration processes derived from discrepancy between the states of the "Global North" and the "Global South", inequality of migrant qualifications, the concurrent approaches of enterprises, public institutions, migrants themselves and receiving states. (8) Researchers try to find answers to the current challenges of migration by suggesting partial, superficial reforms of migration regimes, immigration rules and policies to attract skilled migrant workers.

AB The paper is focused on the contradiction between legal and political rationales in the field of migration regulation on national and international levels. The fundamental norms laid down in the corpus of law may conflict with the politicians' views on the viability of various courses of action. This opens the door to serious collisions between agents motivated by divergent rationales. In practice, however, the subject matter is not so much the difference in rationales but rather differences in interpretation of legal arguments by various actors. They resort to these arguments to the extent that one or another of legal provisions helps legitimizing their political position and actions. Discrepancy in attitudes towards migratory issues creates a number of conflicts which can be classified as follows. (a) The collision of priorities (namely, protection of human rights versus concerns on national security); (b) the collision between proclaimed values and pragmatic rationales; (c) the collision between public rhetoric of the right populists and the game rules set up by liberal-conservative consensus of the political mainstream. The first collision is illustrated by the controversy between American judiciary and D. Trump administration around the travel ban imposed on citizens of Muslim countries as well as the conflict between Executives and the Legislative power on Trump's project to build a wall on Mexican border. The second collision is being played out in the European Union after the refugee crisis (2015): mainstream politicians have to balance between their agenda and pressure from the far-right, so they tend to combine liberal rhetoric with restrictive policies. The example for the third collision is the behaviour of the Italian governing coalition 2018-2019, when Matteo Salvini and his adherents turned out to be less resolute in implementing anti-immigration measures than they promised during election campaign.

ID CONTEXT
AB Economic issues continue to occupy a prominent place in the production of scientific articles that are published in peer-reviewed journals, both in journals specialized in economics, and in multidisciplinary journals or framed in the social and human sciences, so that economic problems continue to be a Transcendental issue for academics and public policy makers in general. The objective of this investigation was to prepare a hemerographic balance of a sample of the articles on economics published in the journal Amazonia Investiga in the period 2019. Methodologically, it is a documentary-based investigation that used the bibliographic-hemerographic balance technique, with the purpose of showing a useful state of the art, to carry out a panoramic reading of the scientific discourse on economics, produced by economists and other scientists, in a high impact informative body. From the investigative process some relevant conclusions emerge, on the one hand, the borders that divide political science and economics are diluted in the revised texts, because economics is, in its own way, a discipline that also deals with power and its interrelations On the other hand, it is observed how the economy is a flexible science that is cultivated in an interdisciplinary way.

AB The production capacity of a state is a key condition for the sustainable economic and social development. The competence and skill level of employees in any position, from cashier to federal official, affects not only labor efficiency, but also the speed of progress in the economic field and, finally, the overall competitiveness of Russia in the context of international market relations. The contributory factors that determine the level of competitiveness of the state economy include the quality of workforce training, directly related to the integration of the economic sphere (one of the four basic spheres, along with political, social and spiritual) with the educational sector. Moreover, from the point of view of the overwhelming majority of Russian education researchers, nowadays, we face serious challenges with the training of highly skilled workers. Managers are forced to bring their employees to the necessary professional level through special in-service courses and programs. An effective solution to the problems of continuing professional development is facilitated by the promotion of employees up the career ladder. It can be described as a gradual advancement of professionals in the field of industrial, scientific, creative or any other constructive activity from the basic qualification level to the highest, or, in other words, as a career development of a particular individual, taking into account his/her mental, psychological, professional and other resources.

AB The article analyzes the factors that determine the evolution of the United States' conceptual approach to the Islamic Republic of Iran during the four administrations (from W Clinton to D. Trump), as well as the main factors that influenced formation of Iran's policy towards the U.S. Since the mid-1990's until recently, Washington's approach has undergone significant changes -from the doctrine of "containing Iran" to the "maximum pressure campaign" on the Iranian leadership. The policy of the current U.S. administration has actually put the Gulf region on the brink of a full-blown military explosion (exchange of missile strikes in January 2020). However, in recent years, Tehran has also noticeably tightened the foreign policy line of "heroic flexibility" proclaimed in 2013 by Ayatollah A. Khamenei. And yet, despite the gigantic military superiority over Iran, the United States seek to avoid a direct clash with it. The reason is not only predicted losses on both sides. The ultimate goal of the American establishment is to bring Iran back to the bosom of partnership with the United States. Tehran understands this, and therefore, from time to time sends reconciliation messages to Washington. In the context of the coronavirus pandemic, the U.S. - Iranian attitude has not changed. It is significant that, despite the magnitude of the epidemic and the number of victims in the country, Tehran refused a humanitarian gesture - the medical assistance offered by the Trump administration. Simultaneously, despite political disagreements with the European Union, the Iranian leadership agreed to accept European assistance. Against this background, the confrontation between the United States and Iran in the Persian Gulf continued to grow: the leaders of both states are betting on a strategy of mutual deterrence, which results in balancing on the verge of a collision.

DT Article
DE Arctic; China; Russia; LNG; infrastructure; Northern Sea Route; military

AB For the past few years, the Arctic has become an indispensable element of the Chinese foreign policy discourse. This article is meant to explore the essence and the character of Beffing's regional aspirations and how they relate to Russian regional strategy. Despite a genuine interest of Chinese organizations in contributing to transformations of the political and economic landscape of the Arctic, one could argue, that polar affairs so far do not constitute a matter of the first and foremost concern for Beifing's diplomacy. The balance of regional interests between China and Russia is differing from one issue to another. The maximum synergy has been achieved in the LNG production area - here Russia is playing the role of an ideal supplier; while China provides maximum demand for this commodity and the lion's share of required project financing. However, Russian oil & gas companies are well aware of risks emerging from over-dependency on Chinese investments. So, in the course of designing future Arctic projects (notably, the "Arctic LNG" by NOVATEK), they are explicitly pursuing the strategy of diversification of the potential investors' scope. In contrast, the PRC's involvement into the development of the Arctic shipping along the Russian northern coast turns out to be not so substantial as it might appear in the mass media. The COSCO's core area of business is container traffic, and the Northern Sea Route so far is not ready to provide this type of cargo transportation in a regular and safe way. That is why China's performance in the NSR is limited to shipments of metal constructions and spare parts for wind-power mills, which are of rather limited added value in comparison with the container traffic (though the number of the COSCO's Arctic transits has been rising since 2015). Finally, in military-strategic terms, the Arctic might attract the attention of the PLAN'S Command in the long run (by the time of accomplishment of the latest (third) stage of the Chinese Navy reform, i.e. by 2050). The Arctic Ocean might potentially be of interest for Beijing as an additional (and maybe the safest) area for the deployment of SSBNs. In the future, China could be even potentially interested in the establishment of a naval base(s) on the Russian northern coast, so to maintain a regular character of SSBNs' operations in the Arctic Ocean. However; a positive feedback from Russian authorities to such an idea is highly unlikely, taking into account basic principles underlying the Russian Maritime Strategy.

AB The article analyzes the religious traditions of the countries of Eastern and Inner Asia, where the cult has gained great popularity. The cult of Heaven is studied and considered from ethnoconfessional, cultural, social, and political aspects. The research presented in this article reveals the autochthonous and rational-pragmatic aspect of this cult, which is characteristic of agricultural China and its settled population, as well as the universal and abstract-philosophical aspect peculiar to nomadic confederations and tribal unions of the Turkic-Mongolian peoples, inhabiting the territory of Inner Asia. The cult of Heaven is studied as its political composite during the Shan-Yin state formation in the territory of China, where it acts as the divine guarantor of the supreme power of the Shang-Yin rulers; the political content of this cult in the state formation of the Great Steppe of Inner Asia is also considered. It is traced how the political content of the Chinese cult of Heaven as a guarantor of supreme authority influences the ideology of the rulers of the first state formations of nomadic tribes in the neighboring region of Inner Asia, which were in closest cultural, political and economic contact with the powerful neighbor.

DE neopragmatism; Richard Bernstein; objectivism; relativism;
   anti-foundationalism
AB Modern American philosophy is unthinkable without pragmatic tendencies, and it is definitely determined by them. The new period of the flourishing of pragmatism in the second half of the 20th century associated with the name of Richard Rorty, who managed to find a solution on how to combine continental and analytic traditions of philosophy, which led to the revival of pragmatism. Richard Bernstein belongs to contemporary neopragmatism, whose representatives are Rorty's direct successors. The assessment of Bernstein's "new" neopragmatism allows understanding the mechanism of the evolution and development of conceptual schemas of two contradictory analytic and continental discourses. According to Bernstein, it makes no sense to diverse analytic or continental traditions in philosophy and also to speak separately about pragmatism, since all three philosophical directions deal with general pragmatist themes that characterize the "pragmatist turn". Bernstein devoted the initial period of his philosophical career to the study of classical pragmatism. In the second period of his work, Bernstein actualizes the issues of understanding the role and place of pragmatism in philosophy, which will have a significant impact on the subsequent development of the whole direction. During this period, Bernstein addresses the key concepts of pragmatist doctrines and discussions - objectivism and relativism, considered in terms of understanding rationality in matters of truth, rational practices and ethical preferences. In all the works of this period, Bernstein uses a critical approach, borrowed from the continental critical theory. Bernstein defines rationality through communication, which is fully consistent with both pragmatist attitudes and the principles of the rhetorical turn. He concludes that even with some "standards of rationality", they are not universal and can change over time or in accordance with the requirements imposed by historical periods or cultures. Bernstein believes that a proper understanding of relativism occurs not only in opposition to objectivism, but also in distinguishing it from subjectivism. Bernstein shows that the concepts of relativism and objectivism are meaningful only from within the Cartesian tradition of modernism, and if the so-called Cartesian anxiety as a kind of fear of relativism is eliminated, it is possible to bring the entire philosophical discourse beyond the limits of objectivism and relativism. It is concluded that Bernstein's views in the second period of his work and the main markers of neopragmatism (anti-foundationalism, pluralism and communicate community) are formed in a critical discussion with the ideas of leading philosophers of science, with continental philosophy, and finally with Rorty. On this basis, this period of his work is qualified as critical neopragmatism.

AB The article substantiates that not all accessible possible worlds are conceivable, and not all conceivable worlds are accessible. The first part shows that the conceivable should (ideally, without taking into account the agent's limits) be accessible, and the second that the inaccessible (due to the agent's limits) possible worlds may be quasiobservable. A comparison is made between the ideas of logical omniscience and the idea of the intellectual limits of the knower. The idea of logical omniscience is associated with the idea of pure logic. The idea of a limited agent is associated with the idea of the possible world's counterfactuality to the real world. The opposition of these ideas is interpreted in the context of an instrumentalist interpretation of logic and mathematics. It is argued that logic and mathematics are only tools of limited agents. The opposition of the purely logical (omniscience) and the logical within the framework of the semantics of possible worlds (agent relativization) also relates the opposition of the purely logical a priori and the conceptual (or informative) a priori. Thus, two interpretations of logical accessibility appear. The idea is expressed that both the formally contradictory and the conceptually contradictory may be beyond the framework of logical accessibility in a limited sense. The accessibility is determined by the semantics of possible worlds linked to a separate distinguished ("real") world and has a metaphysical character. The ontology is determined by the limits and language of the cognizing agent. Finally, it is argued that the idea of a posteriori necessity is not correct due to the fact that empirical sciences do not have strict limitations on the field of the possible. There is neither a "physical necessity" nor a "biological necessity", etc. There is only a logical necessity of the two types mentioned earlier. Therefore, the term "a posteriori necessity" should always be replaced by the term "metaphysically necessary". The connection of the semantics of possible worlds with metaphysics is considered. The reasons why the "epistemically possible" is broader than the "logically possible" in the narrow sense, that is, within the semantics of possible worlds, are explained.

DE ethics of science; history of science; scientific community; science as
   profession and vocation; gift; scientific communication
AB Moralization in the field of scientific activity and its submission to universal morality contradict the flagrant facts of scientists' indifference to moral standards. Even "worthy" scientists are no exception in this regard. We recall Louis Pasteur's proposal to test rabies vaccines in those sentenced to death and Pavlov's experiments on street children. Inside science, "incorrect borrowing" is a far greater sin and is more dangerous for the reproduction of the scientific community than a contradiction with the so-called universal morality, on which society itself does not agree today. Universal morality is simply incompatible with a whole host of "corporate ethics" as codes of isolated communicative systems. If there are any unifying values that can act as conditions of social consensus in a differentiated society, then this is rather a strategy of non-interference in other people's affairs. Science does not interfere in the affairs of religion with its rational justification of religious ontology, and politics does not interfere in science with its distinctions between the "proletarian sciences" and the "corrupt girls of imperialism". Universal morality as applied within science acts as corporate ethics, not as the one mythically affirmed by sacred forces. The obvious "comprehensiveness" of the ethics of science com-pels us to abandon the idea of affirming the mythical foundation for the legitimation of science based on its hypothetical "transcendence". Such an appeal to the cognitive resources of mythological con-sciousness, including, first of all, the ban on questioning, on analytical and comparative methodology, raises doubts about their productivity and persuasiveness. Of course, if one adheres to the mythical justification of the authority of science, then this entire procedure would end with a reference to the corresponding arche (or origo), i.e. to a certain institution that laid the foundation for a particular order of nature. But the resources and self-justification of science are far from exhausted, are not they? Why not use scientific rationality itself, the resources of critical discourse and comparative analysis in order to legitimize science?

AB The United States' withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) in 2019 threatens to dismantle the entire nuclear arms control system built over the last 50 years. It may lead to an uncontrolled multilateral arms race involving strategic, intermediate-range, tactical nuclear and non-nuclear offensive and defensive weapons. This dangerous turn of events is met with different attitude by different politicians and experts. One expanding school of thought postulates that the bipolar world of the Cold War era has given way to multipolarity, so bilateral nuclear weapons restrictions are no longer feasible. This assumption is supplemented by a hypothesis that it is impossible to control the newest weapons and military technologies using previous methods of negotiations and agreements, so those methods should also be abandoned. The focus should allegedly shift to various multilateral forums on creating an environment for nuclear disarmament and enhancing nuclear deterrence, transparency and predictability. Thus, the main premise is that the current arms control crisis is unavoidable and does not pose much danger: it is possible to do without formal nuclear arms reduction, limitation and non-proliferation agreements. However, scientific analysis demonstrates that the above assumptions about the advent of nuclear multipolarity and effects of new technologies are wrong. Firstly, despite deep reductions in nuclear weapons over the last 30 years, the proportion of those controlled by the two leading nuclear powers has barely declined at all, and the nuclear landscape remains largely bilateral. Secondly, the revolutionary impact of military technological progress is not something new, but is a logical phenomenon that has occurred regularly throughout history. Nonetheless, five decades of experience clearly demonstrated that arms control can be very successful, provided there is political will at the highest governments' level to reach agreements on limitation and reduction of nuclear weapons. Like in the past, in the foreseeable future, aims control measures are able to substantially reduce the threat posed by innovative weapons systems. No doubt, arms control agreements do have their limits. But overall, despite certain gaps and failures, the arms control process has scored a number of historical victories during the past 50 years, and it should remain at the core of international security, even if many problems cannot be resolved quickly or all at once. Only the continuation of nuclear arms control can create political and military conditions for eventual limitations of many innovative weapons systems and technologies, as well as for a phased shift to a multilateral format of nuclear disarmament.

ID SATISFACTION
AB The topic of a political perception of healthcare system has not been studied well despite the fact that it heavily influences the political process. The current examples we have been able to see during the coronavirus pandemic. The aim of this study is to determine modern trends in Russian political perception (Moscow as the case) and the content of various components of the population attitudes (cognitive, emotional, behavioral) in this sphere (as a part of general political attitudes). The article is based on a Moscow monitoring research conducted in December 2017 - November 2018 by the authors. The method used is CAPI, the sample is 13,200 Muscovites with elements of random sampling. The sample represented the population of Moscow by age, gender, district of residence, and level of education. The research was focused mainly on the emotional component of the healthcare system image-the dependent variable was the level of satisfaction with Moscow healthcare in general. The research showed a number of factors influencing satisfaction. The first group of factors is connected with the real experience of interaction with healthcare organizations. First, it is the fact of presence of interaction (those who did not visit medical organizations in the last 5 years showed less satisfaction with them). Then it is the type of ownership: the image of healthcare system in Moscow is mainly influenced by public healthcare (mainly by ambulatory care), not private. Socio-demographic factors (gender, income, education, age) appeared to be less influential for the perception than experience. But experience was not the only factor in influencing the image of healthcare as indicated for example by the fact that satisfaction with visiting different kinds of medical organization is much higher than the overall satisfaction with the healthcare system. The research indicates that another influential factor is coverage by mass and social media. There is evidence that information about important social events, even those irrelevant to Moscow healthcare, has a huge impact on the healthcare evaluation (e.g., through changing the general emotional state of population). Other factors include the image of authority itself (public healthcare is perceived to be a state institution), political context (e.g., electoral period) and values (e.g., social justice, health). Among the given recommendations, the most important is to use the proposed model of the political perception of the healthcare system in practice, for it takes into account the complexity of the political perception process. The model shows that the level of satisfaction is not the domain of the medical governing bodies alone, the task of its improvement requires multi-sector coordination; it is the domain of social policy in general. This work is crucial because, as the research showed, there is a strong interconnection between the image of the healthcare system and the image of authority in Russia.

AB The article analyzes the representation of the internal situation in Germany and Austria-Hungary in the Russian periodicals during the initial period of the First World War (August 1914 - July 1915). The war greatly complicated the ways and means of obtaining foreign information, the only source of which remained the official Petrograd Telegraph Agency. Another source was "unofficial information" provided daily by the Main Directorate of the General Staff. Among other things, agency telegrams and General Staff information regularly informed about the socio-economic and political crisis in the camp of the opponents of Russia. Messages about the threat of hunger, falling production, rising unemployment, ethnic hatred in Germany and Austria-Hungary were repeated daily, and their number grew and over time began to exceed the number of reports of hostilities. At first, the press fully shared this point of view and waited for the end of the war no later than in December 1914. However, by the beginning of 1915 there were more and more doubts that Germany would surrender voluntarily and that her position was hopeless. These doubts intensified in the spring of 1915, when, against the background of rising prices in Russia, the food policy of Germany in many articles was for the first time evaluated positively. In the summer of 1915, due to the heavy defeats of the Russian army, the press openly admitted that Russia was opposed by a strong enemy who would not surrender voluntarily. The recognition of the strength of the enemy has become one of the most important factors of the internal political crisis in Russia.

AB The South of Russia acts as a territory of interest for operating of new religious movements. The strategy of fighting extremism in the Russian Federation until 2025 defines the activities of a number of new religious associations as extremist and contributing to the development of ethnic and religious strife. At the same time, the southern Russian regions are the most exposed to external influence, including religious aspect. Methods: through institutional analysis, the study is to assess the activity of new religious movements in the Cossack environment. Analysis: Political and socio-cultural crisis in the border regions of Ukraine served as a source of support for a number of sects in the region. Among their priorities were activities in the Cossack communities. The infiltration of neo-paganism, sects of Western origin within the Cossack environment was detected at the level of leadership of regions of the Southern and North Caucasus Federal districts, as well as the Russian Orthodox Church. The issue of creation of Autocephalous "Church" for Cossacks, also constituting a destructive role, was actualized. Results: the paper evaluates the activity of new cults in the Cossack environment, as well as the attempts made by marginal groups of the Cossacks of creating the "Church" of their own. The study has identified the necessity of strengthening the efforts of the Executive authorities to combat totalitarian sects in the Southern Russian regions.

DE charity; state support; poorhouses; alms; begging
AB The authors analyze the phenomenon of charity and state support in Russia in a very difficult 17th century. The beginning of the century was tragic for the country. Three years of famine put the population on the verge of extinction, which was described in detail by foreigners in the Russian service - J. Margeret, K. Bussov, and others. The article examines the measures taken by Tsar Boris Godunov to save the population: from selling cheap bread and distributing money to fighting speculation and confiscating food supplies. These measures saved many ordinary people, but did not keep Russia away from social and political chaos: turmoil, foreign intervention, and a change of dynasty. These events activated the potential of church and private charity, which acted as a kind of social shock absorbers in the conditions of political turbulence. With the restoration of a homeostatic balance in the socio-political system of Russia, which was de jure reflected in the Council Code of Tsar Alexey Mikhailovich (1649), there was a further development of charity. Along with the traditional Christian forms of charity: alms, feeding the population, ransoming prisoners, burial of the dead, etc., state structures were also created - the Palace Patriarchal and Pharmaceutical Prikazes. This was an objective necessity due to the weakening of the role of the zemstvo and church aid to the population, at least because of the decrease in the number of free peasants. So, in the 17th century, a statist trend in charity emerged, which was reflected in the project of Tsar Fyodor Alekseevich, approved at the Church Council (1682). The project proposals were aimed at eradicating beggary and against poverty in general. This is evidenced by the project's thesis about teaching sciences and crafts to poor children and helping them in life management. The authors noted the ideas and activities of Epiphanius Slavinetsky and Fyodor Rtishchev, who were innovators of charity. However, the innovative ideas and practices were fragmentarily implemented during the reign of Peter the Great.

DE conflict; international environmental conflict; conflict management;
   mediation
AB An environmental conflict (including an international one) can be defined as the interaction of two or more parties who perceive their goals for changing (or preserving) the state of the natural environment (life support systems-ecosystems) as incompatible. Specific characteristics that make international environmental conflicts more difficult to manage include the presence of a large number of parties and participants; a large number of issues; the inability to quantify costs/damage; and the potential irreversibility of negative conflict outcomes; the conflict goes beyond one jurisdiction; the implementation of the agreements reached depends on governmental bodies. The possibility of developing solutions outside of formal legal procedures seems to be an advantage of most alternative methods of resolving (out-of-court settlement) disputes, including the resolution of environmental conflicts. Environmental conflicts and disputes can involve a wide range of public policy issues, so it is important in some cases to expand existing environmental knowledge in order to achieve the long-term goals of society. International public participation, "public diplomacy", consideration of cross-cultural factors and other circumstances contribute to extrajudicial decisions that may require concerted action by international, national, regional and local authorities in order to be implemented. In order for mediation to be successfully used to resolve international environmental conflicts, a number of conditions are required: one or more parties must be aware of the problem; a willing, competent and trustworthy mediator is required; the parties to the dispute must have approximately equal powers and capabilities; each potential participant in mediation must recognize others as legitimate and equal participants; none of the interested parties should be excluded from the negotiation process; the results of mediation should be tangible and have a significant effect. The most important condition for successful mediation is the presence of a "zone of compromise", that is, solutions that the parties will prefer to no agreement. The article concludes that the main features of mediation as an institution for resolving cross-border and international environmental conflicts that occur between parties belonging to different cultures and socio-economic structures are its flexibility and informal nature; voluntary participation of the parties and the choice of a mediator; equality of the parties in the negotiation process; confidentiality of the mediation process; and neutrality (impartiality) of the mediator. Mediation allows taking into account cross-cultural differences through direct communication.

AB The art of the XX century remains the subject of social and human sciences. Sociologists, culturologists, art historians, political scientists, philosophers and other specialists considered the phenomenon from various points of view. Researchers agree that the art of the last century have a pluralism of directions, currents and schools. XX century is marked by a variety of "isms" - Abstractionism, Suprematism, Purism, Futurism, Cubism, Surrealism. All these "isms" express certain values of artists and their admirers, a special outlook of the creative class. Each "ism" marks the concrete picture of the world.
   Researchers also agree that the art of the XX century have been marked by the courage of creative experiments. According to some thinkers, the courage of artistic experiments led to "dehumanization" of art. Artists refused to depict an image of world that is familiar to human. The place of the usual forms was occupied by "lifeless" compositions. Abstractions were challenged even by the most sophisticated spectators.
   Metamorphoses occurred not only with plan of expression, but also with plan of content. Art of the XX century reacted sensitively to the biggest social shifts - revolutions, wars, genocide, increasing influence of ideologies, etc. Various schools of the visual arts (for example, the schools of socialist realism and the Third Reich) expressed new collective values - the values of unity and struggle for ideals, for the reorganization of the old world. In the focus of the art were not only collective, but individual values, not only the life of society, but also the life of individuals.
   Representatives of "marginal" art, "Art Brut" and "Outsider art" focused on human nature, physicality, psyche and the states of the soul. In the XX century the sophisticated spectator could no longer be surprised by canvases with pornographic scenes, sexual perversions and scenes of violence. Unlike abstractionists, the artists of the realistic underground depicted the forms familiar to the human eye. More precisely, the lowest manifestations of human nature were depicted. Unlike the socialist realists, these artists did not portray the enthusiastic builders of the earthly paradise. In the art of the XX century, unlike the canons of classicism and modernism, a human was portrayed as "too inhuman".
   The originality of the art of the XX century can be expressed in the increased attention of artists to the existential problems. It cannot be said that existential questions were never raised in the art of the past. But it was in the XX century when sharpness of existential problems reached its peak. The themes of estrangement, abandonment, loneliness, mental pain, insanity, fear and horror, flight from realities, anger and aggression were revealed in pictures by various authors around the world. Existential art was consonant with the philosophy of existentialism, represented by J.-P. Sartre, A. Camus, K. Jaspers, M. Buber, G. Marcel. Unlike the existential philosophers, artists and sculptors, above all, amazed the human eye. Bright images from canvases could affect the addressee far more than ideas from the pages of books. Professional artists used a variety of techniques that made it possible to clearly express the existential problems in the art. In this article I will focus on both plans of expression and content represented in the existential art.

AB The article explores perception of China's economic growth and its increased influence in Northeast Asia (NEA) by other countries of this region. It analyzes how Japan and South Korea view opportunities deriving from deeper economic cooperation with the PRC, including expansion into huge Chinese domestic market, as well as risks and challenges associated with it. The authors deliberate on different aspects and political implications of China's role as a key trade partner to these countries. Political relations are explored with attention to old disputes and sources of distrust and conflict, as well as new risks and vulnerabilities that make NEA countries pay more attention to growing China's activity in the region. Traditional issues of contention include territorial claims, different perceptions of history, ideological disputes and conflicting security concepts. Recent concerns center on Beijing's foreign policy ambitions and dissimilar visions of future security architecture, both regional and global. The authors look into the possibilities and limits for the NEA countries' e f forts to balance China's presence by involving the United States in solving regional problems. Mixed reaction of these countries to recent changes in the U.S. policy in the region is also explored, as well as the impact of these changes on international relations in the region. Much attention is paid to experience and scenarios of multilateral e f forts to secure stability on the Korean Peninsula and promote its denuclearization. Attention is also drawn to the NEA countries' efforts to diversify their political and economic interaction with the rest of the world, to promote multilateral frameworks and integration projects. To a large extent, these efforts are aimed, the authors argue, at creating international institutional framework to safeguard against Chinese attempts to dominate in the region. At the same time, the NEA countries view them as a tool to engage Beijing in the process of developing durable rules for future interaction and invite China to play a constructive role in alleviating current concerns.

DE ego-identity; crisis of identity; self-determination;
   self-consciousness; folk; nation
AB Back in the middle of the past century, philosophers understood that the freedom open society gave people would become a serious challenge for them. The accelerated processes of individualization, informational variety and almost no boundaries for communication require special personal qualities that contribute to super-adaptation based on excess psychological and social lability. As the social structure becomes more complex and the speed of the scientific, technological and social progress grows, the issue of a person's self-determination becomes relevant. This is confirmed by a wide public discussion of the problem of ego-identity at various levels: ethnic, religious, national, political, gender, professional, etc. The study of human identity is impossible without analyzing the concepts of the crisis of self-determination and the individual's identity. The article describes the essence of the crisis of identity, its historical genesis from the standpoint of contemporary philosophy, it also identifies relevant areas of research strategies to overcome such crises. The results of the research allow concluding that the ego-identity problem has a paradoxical essence. Based on this, it is assumed that one of the possibilities to resolve the identity crisis is to oppose the conditional variable of identity to its own opposite. It is shown that this method of resolving the crisis of self-determination is vicious, both in terms of epistemological grounds and in terms of ethical and aesthetic expression. Thus, the future research will focus on the following tasks: the analysis of the logical and epistemological foundations of the ego-identity problem; the clarification of the connection between reflexive self-consciousness and the self-determination crisis; the study of cultural and historical features of national identity on the example of different peoples; the determination of constructive mechanisms of self-determination, at the level of both the individual and society.

DE disability; mental retardation; social exclusion; philosophy of
   disability
AB Nowadays, special attention is paid to the problem of integrating people with disabilities into society due to the fact that the Russian Federation has ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and adopted associated regulations. The article examines the socio-philosophical approaches to the problem of disability and identifies the most productive grounds for the integration of people with intellectual developmental needs. Despite the active creation of conditions for inclusion of people with disabilities, in practice there is a frequent unsuitability of these innovations, as well as the lack of successful mechanisms for integrating people with intellectual limitations. This situation is connected with the theoretical approaches underlying the consideration of the problem, such as positivism, the ideas of which are relevant to the medical model of disability. A person with a disability is considered as a patient, an inferior, who must either be cured or excluded from society, which leads to discrimination. However, social models which shift the focus of the problem from the disabled person to society are also criticized for creating an opposite, positive discrimination of the disabled, which generates public dissatisfaction. The article makes a conclusion that the most acceptable is the concept of human diversity, which assumes the normal coexistence of all categories of people, regardless of their characteristics. In turn, the development of inclusion mechanisms uses the theory of social exclusion, with the help of which exclusion indicators are identified. The highlighted indicators are the result of theoretical analysis and sociological research through interviews with specialists from boarding houses for mentally retarded children conducted in 2016-2018 in Siberia. As a result of the study, the following indicators were identified: exclusion from family upbringing; monotony of social environment; territorial remoteness; exclusion from educational, social and cultural life; predetermined life path. Indicators allow noting not only the existing limitations of integration, but also marking its most effective mechanisms. In conclusion, it is stated that the analysis of socio-philosophical foundations allows determining the most productive theories that underlie technologies. In the future, the model of human diversity and the theory of social exclusion could become fundamental in relation to the integration of people with cognitive disabilities.

AB The article compares Popper's falsifiability theory and Wittgenstein's theory of meaning in the context of the historical and philosophical approach to the problem of the formation of new knowledge and its justification. The argument is presented that the formation of any epistemological field is determined by a constellation of fact. The article uses arguments relating to Wittgenstein's both philosophical periods. The main object of study in this article is the significance of the linguistic factor in the formation of new aspects of vision (in scientific, metaphysical systems, etc.). The working hypothesis is as follows: a comparative analysis of the concept of Wittgenstein's meaning and the concept of Popper's falsifiability shows that new epistemological fields are formed as a result of one or another constellation of fact; one of the main reasons for this state of affairs is the linguistic factor that determines the correlations between the reality of individual consciousness and reality. The aim of this study is to justify the thesis, according to which different types of discourses provide for the possibility of using various bases of reliability. In addition, for a detailed analysis of the problem, it is extremely important to consider the formation of new knowledge as one of the results of the multifunctional activity of the cognizing subject of knowledge in the context of Wittgenstein's theory of meaning and Popper's theory of falsifiability. The following research methods were used in the study: the method of rational reconstruction was used to compare Wittgenstein's theory of meaning and Popper's theory of falsifiability within the boundaries of the historical and philosophical approach; in order to establish the possible principles for the formation of new knowledge, an analytical method was used to analyze the structural elements of complex structures; to analyze the role of the linguistic factor in the formation of intersubjective reality, an explication method was used, which made it possible to consider the interaction of a logically possible world and the empirical world.

AB The article attempts to understand scientific vocation as an existential choice in connection with Ilya Kasavin's work on the calling of the scientist. The article recognizes vocation as a combination of random preconditions of personal formation and the influence of value and cultural foundations orienting a person to the courageous adherence to "ultimate senses". Scientific vocation appears as a scientist's "unravelling" of the history of his/her life in the horizon of existential experience determining the main lines of self-development. The calling of the scientist is an element of cultural memory connecting modernity with the spiritual heritage of the past. "Disenchanted" ideals and values continue playing a key role in the formation of the scientific ethos on a secular basis. It is shown that rationalization of scientific vocation helps construing the motivation of scientific growth. Relevant illustrations refer to Gabriel Marcel's autobiographical essay and Rollo May's memoirs about Paul Tillich's spiritual formation.

AB The paper studies ethno-religious mentality issues through modern Karachay-Balkar poetry of the late XX and early XXI centuries. Global changes in the ideological, political, spiritual aspects of life have galvanized interest in determining ethnic and cultural influence on artistic creativity in modern poetry. It goes without saying that rites, customs, and other folk ethnographic elements have gradually begun disappearing; new forms are replacing them nowadays. Therefore, one of the urgent tasks in literary criticism, as we see it, is analysis of works of literature created by New-Generation Authors that reflect, in our opinion, the major trends and national peculiarities.
   Literary analysis of the works of new authors are carried out for the first time. We hope we could manage to trace the specifics of the interrelationship of continuity and innovation, to research evolution nature and the prospects for the development of artistic awareness of the young poets in the region.

DE indispensability argument; semantic holism; confirmational holism;
   naturalism; pragmatism
AB The author of the article does not agree with the ontology of mathematical Platonism. Mathematical Platonism is justified by the argument that mathematics is indispensable from natural sciences. At the beginning of the article, the author gives an example of Hartry Field's nominalistic strategy, which argues against the indispensability of mathematics. However, the main thesis of the article is that it is enough to show that the argument about the indispensability of mathematics does not actually have direct Platonic consequences. The main focus is on the Quine-Putnam Indispensability Argument in Mark Colyvan's Platonic interpretation. The article discusses how Colyvan justifies this argument. In particular, Quine's doctrines of epistemological naturalism and confirmational holism are considered. Colyvan's interpretation is called into question. The author analyzes the premises of accepting the indispensability argument in the framework of Quine's original philosophy. The author concludes that if we are trying to justify the argument by using Quine's philosophy, we have to reject its Platonic consequences. Quine's semantic holism and his reference theory do not assume the existence of Platonic objects that are independent of our consciousness. Quine's assumption is that science as a whole is simultaneously dependent on both language and experience, and this duality cannot be meaningfully traced to statements taken separately. This is why we cannot assert the a priori nature of mathematical statements. This contradicts the views of mathematical Platonism. In addition, Russell's description theory that Quine adopted allows us to restrict our ontology from any undesirable entities, including abstract mathematical objects. We postulate objects only when we involve the terms denoting them in a suitable interaction with the entire apparatus of our language. The question of whether to consider a language unit as a term is decided on the basis of the .systematic effectiveness of its use as a term. Any ontological assumptions are a matter of practical usability of the conceptual schema of science. In this way, it is possible to preserve the indispensability argument, which is traditionally given in defense of mathematical Platonism. At the same time, we can reject its Platonic consequences without appealing to nominalistic interpretations of scientific theories.

AB The article analyzes the Chinese politics and bilateral relations with Northeast Asian countries in the second decade of the 21st century through the prism of theoretical innovations proposed by the PRC leadership in the field of international diplomacy, economic development and global governance as well as its initiatives in the sphere of "cooperative interaction" and ensuring regional security. The author shows that China's acquisition of the global power status and the active promotion of its own agenda in international affairs had a weak effect on its position in NEA and relations with countries of the region, including Russia. Although Beijing incorporates all the states of the region into its "global partnership network", it is not some theoretical models and idealistic concepts, but specific economic interests, political calculations, cultural factors and historical baggage that play a key role in China's relations with Japan, North and South Korea, Mongolia or Russia. Chinese diplomacy takes into account the extremely complicated balance of power and configuration of relations in the region, and therefore, does not make much effort to promote new formats of integration and security building in the region, considering it sufficient to demonstrate good intentions of the PRC and its behavior as a "responsible state". The north-eastern part of Eurasia, including the Pacific part of Russia, is modestly represented in Xi Jinping's "One Belt, One Road" initiative, it is not the object of its financial expansion, and therefore, the nature and scale of China's economic interaction with NEA countries have not changed much over the past decade.

DE a priori knowledge; archetype; episteme
AB (1) As well as a priori knowledge, archetypes are inherent in all people, while episteme and archetypal images have a more private nature, limited to the spread among the representatives of a particular culture. (2) A priori knowledge and archetypes are innate and hereditary. Episteme, along with archetypal images, is a sociocultural product of community development. (3) Episteme, along with archetypal images, is much more changeable than a priori knowledge and archetypes. (4) A priori knowledge and archetypes determine cognition already at the level of perception. Foucauldian epistemes and archetypical images are inherently symbolic, and are much more conscious products. At the same time, archetypes and archetypal images are inextricably linked. To a certain extent, archetypes appear and become available to consciousness (and hence for study) in archetypal images. They do not oppose, but rather complement each other. Based on the archetypal approach, it becomes possible to analyze the process and results of cognition simultaneously at different levels: unconscious and consciously symbolic. In addition, the concept of the collective unconscious underlying the Jungian paradigm reveals the sphere of the complex dynamic social nature of the self-organization of knowledge. All this allows us to speak about the convenience of using Jung's ideas to study the issues covered in epistemology and social philosophy. The concepts of archetype and archetypal image as heuristic tools are perfect for analyzing the deep foundations of social interactions. The explanation of social reality is definitely not limited to the archetypal influence of the collective unconscious. Here it is necessary to consider well-realized, targeted economic and political actions of social agents. Nevertheless, through the prism of the concept of archetypes, it is quite convenient to show the conditions of social processes that are at the unconscious level of the human psyche and at the same time to try to identify those general schemas that are invariants for individuals.

DE gift; vocation; scientific knowledge; scientific community; tacit
   knowledge
AB The article focuses on the analysis of the phenomena of scientific vocation and gift. Using the concept of vocation and gift allows presenting communication among scientists as distributed by hierarchical positions in a specific field of exchange of gifts. Interacting, scientists master both norms of behavior and a set of knowledge explicitly presented in the scientific community, as well as norms of behavior and practice associated with tacit knowledge characteristic of the scientific community. Orientation to the realization of one's own vocation and exchange of gifts is a mechanism that allows the scientific community to maintain its functioning. As a result, a special social structure of the scientific community is formed. It is based on following the rules of preservation and transfer of gifts. At the same time, the initial acceptance of a gift in the social game of exchanging gifts is an agreement to master a certain set of tacit knowledge, use it in the activities on cognizing the world, and follow the rules of forming hierarchies. The communities of "shamans" and "priests" in their activities, like the community of scientists, are guided by the concepts of vocation and gift. In the communities of "shamans" and "priests" these concepts suggest the formation of a practice of sharing gifts, aimed at maintaining the community's unity. In them, only existing knowledge can be brought as a gift. In the community of scientists, following a vocation and the practice of sharing gifts continually cast doubt on the community's unity. Inclusion in the practice of exchange of gifts requires the acceptance of a gift, but only new knowledge can be a return gift. As a result, solidarity in the communities of "shamans" and "priests" implies agreement within the framework of one common position. In the community of scientists, solidarity is associated with the formation of a space of interaction between diverse approaches to the knowledge of nature, social and historical reality.

DE scientific knowledge; science; knowledge; method
AB Modern science, like culture as a whole, is the diversity of points of view, opinions and assessments. Some scientists advocate the creation of a common criteria, a single base or common rules for scientific knowledge and science. Others are supporters of diversity, which allows the creation of new sciences or directions by connecting both adjacent and non-adjacent areas. Paul Feyerabend analyzes this topic in detail in his Against Method, Science in a Free Society, Farewell to Reasonl Feyerabend separates two traditions in the justification of scientific theories: rational and historical. The first tradition is science as a body of knowledge, the second is science as a living activity that is part of history. Feyerabend separates the context of discovery (history of obtaining part of knowledge) and the context of justification (content and methods of recognition). The rational tradition differs from the historical one: the former successfully creates formulations, theories, principles and facts that are presented as objective, universal. The historical tradition is characterized by creativity in the creation of a scientific theory. The rational tradition dictates laws by which scientific research should develop and which must be observed. Considering modern versions of approaches to the study of science, the formulations "historical" and "rational" proposed by Feyerabend seem to be not logical enough to clarify the differences. The problem of the choice of tradition in modern philosophy is not resolved categorically. In modern research, a new type of rationality is formed in a moral and ethical context. The relevant problems of the ethics of the scientist in the study of technical knowledge and the technosphere raise the question of choosing a method in a new way. The analysis of historical and philosophical ideas demonstrates, first, the duration of the existence of universal methods in different time frames and, then, a return to the problem of choosing traditions. Thus, the problem of choosing the rational or historical tradition (or in other interpretations) is solved by the goals and expected results of scientific activity rather than by creating a comprehensive method or approach.

DE migrants; cultural memory; questioning; multiculturalism
AB The authors discuss the features of the philosophical analysis of the "problem of migrants". Cultural myths play an important role in the migrant discourse of modern Russia. The urgency of studying the cultural memory of Russians in the conditions of the increasing rates of migration and the potential escalation of historical myths' "wars of memory" is stated. The article presents the results of a sociological research conducted by the method of questioning in 2018 among migrants and Russians (a total of 3003 people) living in Russia (Tambov, Lipetsk, Voronezh, Saratov, and Kazan). The sample was multi-stage (quotas are the city of residence, gender and age of the respondent). The authors constructed tables of frequency distribution by questions and tables of conjugacy depending on the sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents. Questions reflect axiological, behavioral, linguistic and cognitive aspects of the diffusion of cultural images. Results of research revealed a high degree of Russians' readiness to cultural diffusion. Migrants and Russians, in general, share the values of each other, have a low degree of ethnocentric views on their religion. The differences are revealed in the level of migrants' and Russians' ethnocentric views on their own history. Russians quite consciously seek to gain new knowledge about history, not limited to the knowledge gained in school. Russians have a more critical attitude to the objectivity of history. Linguistic aspects of the cultural diffusion of migrants and Russians are not obvious. A high level of cultural diffusion can be noted in terms of the behavioral aspect. In the course of social practices, personal qualities come to the fore. It is worth noting that Russians are apolitical, they do not show significant interest in migrants' political practices. The absence of real prerequisites for the confrontation of images of residents' and migrants' cultural memory.

AB Modem Russian science pays considerable attention to the study of the Revolution and the Civil War through the prism of personal-social history. At the same time, researchers today are increasingly turning to the problem of a "little man"-an ordinary participant in those events. This makes it possible to more fully comprehend a number of processes that took place in the state and society at the time and involved random citizens distant from politics, who in other circumstances would have remained beyond the military and political spheres. The general historiography of the issue is analyzed. The aim of the article is to reconstruct the biography of Evgeny Alexandrovich Beregovoi (1891-1920), indicative for the time, in as many details as possible from the historical sources the author of the article discovered. Beregovoi was a wartime infantry officer who served in the army intelligence of the Kolchak government. To achieve the aim of the study, the following tasks have been solved: (1) the available historical sources on the topic have been identified and comprehensively analyzed; (2) the circumstances that influenced Beregovoi's social adaptation, his behavior and life outcome have been specified. The basis for the study was unpublished sources the author first discovered in the archives of the Department of the Federal Security Service of Russia in Omsk Oblast and the Historical Archive of Omsk Oblast. The sources were investigation documents from Beregovoi's archived criminal case and the materials of the departmental records of the Omsk provincial Cheka. Using the sources, Beregovoi's life path is presented in much detail. Based on the specifics of the study, its method is biographical. A special attention in the publication is paid to the study of Beregovoi's professional activities and his attempts to adapt socially to the conditions of the military revolutionary period of 1914-1920. The author concludes that Ensign Beregovoi's biography, presented to the reader, is an example of the involvement of an apolitical civilian in the anti-Bolshevik movement, who, ultimately, by the will of the events, passed away tragically. The article also provides a brief overview of the possibility of using materials of archived criminal cases of former officers in historical biographical studies. The article may be of interest to a wide range of readers: researchers of the Civil War in Russia, specialists in Russian military and special services history, practicing genealogists.

DE total unity; Russian cosmism; myth-making; Arctic hypothesis
AB Nikolai Klyuev, a native of the Old Believers of the Russian North, brought a deep understanding of the folk tradition to poetry. The North became a refuge for Schismatics who fled from the church reforms of the 17th century. They continued the tradition of the manuscript book and retained ancient knowledge about the structure of the universe. Such an artifact as The Pigeon's Book, according to the historian M.L. Seryakov, is older than the Rigveda. The Russian culture of the Silver Age discovered its antiquity in India resurrecting the legend of Hyperborea. The topic of India entered Klyuev's life early, thanks to his mother. In his autobiographies, he claimed close acquaintance with the world of the East and Belovodye. "White India" for Klyuev is the "sacred ancestral home of humankind", and the path from goes in different directions: to the Middle East, North Africa (Egypt), India, and even to China. In the eighteenth century, the French astronomer Jean-Sylvain Baillie formulated the Arctic hypothesis of the origin of humankind. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Fabre d'Olivet, A. Saint-Yves d'Alveidre, W.F. Warren, and B.G. Tilak developed this hypothesis. In 1912, Klyuev became close to the Workshop of Poets (Nikolai Gumilyov was one of its founders) and collaborated with the Acmeist magazine Giperborey. Klyuev's awareness of the secrets of the past was based on the Old Believer book wisdom rather than on new-fashioned esoteric teachings. One of the sources of secret knowledge for Klyuev was the experience of Khlyst mysticism. N.I. Barsov, N.K. Roerich, N.R. Guseva, E.S. Lazarev, A.V. Kondratiev indicated the proximity of the Khlyst teachings to Hinduism. The common roots of Russia and China are found in the dragon cult, which is confirmed by Academician B.A. Rybakov; and A.V. Rachinsky and A.E. Fedorov point to the semantic proximity of Russian temples and the Indo-Iranian tradition of architecture. In his preference of the East to the West, Klyuev was close to N.F. Fedorov, the founder of Russian cosmism. The poet shared Fedorov's ideas about the future of the Earth and the peoples inhabiting it, who will be able to overcome the conditions of a "non-brotherly state" in the name of the unity of humankind. Klyuev's image of "IndiaRus" is of a universal scale. Klyuev's idea about the unity of humankind is relevant today. To the turn of the twentieth century, accepting the ideas of the philosophy of all-unity and cosmism, Russian literature declared the need for the peaceful coexistence of various cultural and historical communities in the name of the preservation and development of all humankind.

DE science and technology; scientific vocation; science popularization; mad

AB This article focuses on the ambivalent perception of scientific vocation in the public mind (illustrated by popular culture). The author suggests and justifies the idea that the dual perception of the scientist and the popularity of the "mad" and "evil" scientist stereotypes in popular culture, especially since the 20th century, have archaic roots. The archaic nature of these stereotypes can be traced to alchemy, searches for physical immortality, etc. Originated from ancient times, the scientific calling comes into conflict with the "intellectualistic rationalization" and "disenchantment" of the world in Western European culture and, as a result, with professionalization as an inevitable element in science as a social institution. At the same time, though, the image of genius scientists who are not dissolved in collective scientific knowledge survives in culture, generating various facets of scientists' perception. Studies of science communication show that the stereotypes of "mad" and "evil" scientists remain the most popular in literature and media, which can hardly be explained solely by the commercialization of these images. Rather, the popularity of these stereotypes lies in the archaic past: scientists appear as priests, ready to make great sacrifices for the greater good.

AB Richard Rorty's neopragmatism was influenced by many sources, from John Dewey's classical pragmatism to postmodern "postphilosophical" concepts. Despite the harsh criticism of analytic philosophy, his style bears a significant imprint of the latter's argumentative methods. His promotion of the subject of continental philosophy in America was accompanied by the adoption of its methods, in particular, hermeneutics as an alternative to scientism. Bringing Rorty's concept of language to the fore is thus a combination of contradictory processes: on the one hand, the revision of the famous Linguistic Turn and, on the other hand, the concept of philosophy as "the conversation of mankind". Although separated by time, these two tendencies nevertheless continued to conflict in Rorty's works, and one of the manifestations of this conflict is the implicit opposition of the methods of argumentation and hermeneutics in non-pragmatism. The article analyzes Rorty's idea of the place of hermeneutics, especially in the Gadamer style, in the conflict of scientist pragmatism and continental philosophy's postmodernism. Rorty's borrowing of the concept of conversation leads to a collision of two linguistic manifestations argumentation and rhetoric. The tendency of preference for rhetoric in this situation is one of the important doctrines of the so-called "new neopragmatism" of Richard Bernstein and Joseph Margolis. Rorty's position is controversial: in his writings, the argumentative technique of the scientist type is gradually replaced by a hermeneutic interpretation. The aim of this article is to demonstrate several examples of the transformation of argumentation into rhetoric as a philosophical method. According to Gadamer's hermeneutics, understanding cannot surpass description, and, besides, there can be no single correct description of nature. Based on this, Rorty concludes that no "insights" of scientists can claim a privileged description if it is based on argument. This is a justification for the fact that rhetoric should be the main tool in the methodology of new neopragmatism. It is shown that Rorty's efforts are aimed at understanding how Gadamer's description of philosophical thought can be integrated with alternative descriptions used by analytic philosophers.

DE scientific ethos; rationality; Modernity; trust; institutes;

AB The article considers the problem of social grounds for the distrust of science, which is connected with the demand for pseudo- and anti-scientific movements. The author believes that the opposition movements to official science speculate on a person's desire for "ontological security" and a stable picture of the world. In this regard, the "reflexive nature" of scientific knowledge turns out to be an obstacle to gaining a solid existential foundation in the face of increasing information pressure. The author believes that the archaization of ordinary consciousness becomes a response to intensive structural changes in the society and indicates a protest attitude towards them. Referring to Anthony Giddens' ideas, the author claims that the distrust of science is associated with the destruction of a personalist model of pre-modern trust and the need fora transition to trust in "abstract systems". In this regard, the author analyzes the prospects of using a personalist model of trust in strengthening the legitimacy of science as a social institution and places hopes on the emergence of public opinion leaders among scientists. The expansion of scientific rationality, which will be primarily associated with the recognition of scientific ethos as a reference model of communication in a democratic society, can help overcome the crisis of institutional trust.

AB The article is devoted to the study of nastol'nye gramoty of Russian bishops of the last third of the 17th century as a historical source. The researcher focuses on the evolution of the text of nastol'nye gramoty. It can be traced in the course of comparative textual research of three unpublished nastol'nye gramoty of the last third of the 17th century (Metropolitan of Novgorod, Joakim (Savelov) in 1673, Metropolitan of Kazan.drian in 1686, Metropolitan of Krutitci Tikhon in 1696). The structure and content of the notes are the same, but their semantic content has significantly changed within the framework of the chronological segment under consideration. The article shows that the change in the texts of nastol'nye gramoty was directly related to the general political and church situation, the change in the nature of the relationship between the state and the church at the beginning of reforms of the Peter the Great. New realities brought to life a new image of the bishop. In the gramoty's, theological passages and abundant quotations are replaced by lengthy lists of requirements for the newly delivered bishop, his duties are clearly recorded, sanctions are introduced for the bishop to violate the prescribed standards of behavior. An important trend, reflected in the text of nastol'nye gramoty of the late XVII century, there was an increase in the motive for the subordination of the bishop to the patriarch. The strengthening of the bureaucratic element and the tendency of discipline in relation to the higher clergy are being observed: to replace the understanding of the bishop from the point of view of his personification of the image of God on earth, his assessment is being formed from the point of view of the functioning of the management system, "yako nekoego uda", part of the church' body. All these tendencies found development and consolidation during the period of the church reform of Peter I.

DE John Toland; religious-philosophical ideas; Soviet historians of
   philosophy
AB The article provides a chronological review of some basic provisions of the selected Soviet historiography of the religious-philosophical ideas of an original Irish philosopher John Toland (30.11.1670-11.03.1722). The works of leading domestic experts in Toland's philosophy - G.S. Tymyansky, A.V. Shcheglov, K.I. Salimova, A.M. Deborin, B.V. Meerovsky, B.E. Bykhovsky - are analyzed. These authors interpret Toland's religious-philosophical ideas as parts of their works. The author of this article notes that the study of this historiography is very relevant, because it allows developing a careful and respectful attitude to the heritage and traditions of national historical-philosophical knowledge and learning the research potential of the Soviet formational-evolutionary historiography of Toland's religious-philosophical ideas. The aim of the article is to identify the main characteristics of Toland's religious-philosophical ideas discussed in the selected Soviet historiography. As a result, the following was stated. First, Soviet specialists actively developed the provisions on Toland's contribution to the doctrines of deism, pantheism, and materialism. Second, Soviet specialists focused on the fact that Toland criticized religion in general, as well as Christianity in particular. Third, Soviet specialists almost unanimously noted the atheistic orientation of Toland's religious-philosophical ideas (very often disagreeing about the depth of Toland's atheism). The article is provided with a reference section in the form of short bibliographic descriptions of the first original editions of a number of Toland's works (de visu), short personalities, short dictionary and bibliographic entries (de visu). The reference section allows assessing the breadth of both Toland's religious-philosophical ideas and the historiographic materials considered in this article.

AB The aim of the article is to identify the main approaches of BRICS to the interpretation of the "security-development nexus" based on the analysis of the organization's final documents following the results of the nine summits (from 2009 to 2017). The main objectives of the research are: (1) to examine the "security-development" concept in the international relations; (2) to analyze the problems of the BRICS summits, evaluate the dynamics of changes in the agenda; (3) to identify the role of the security-development nexus connection, as well as the concepts of security and development in the BRICS activities based on the analysis of their references in the final documents for nine years (2009-2017). The article presents a research devoted to the analysis of the use of the security-development nexus in the BRICS activities. This nexus has been actively mentioned in the international political discourse since the 2000s, causing numerous debates among the academic community around the world. The process of a theoretical comprehension of this concept is of special interest and is related to the "developmentalization of security" and "securitization of development". Special issues of such authoritative journals as Third World Quarterly and Security Dialogue are devoted to the security-development nexus. The urgency of the analysis is determined by three factors: (1) the growing role of regional and interregional organizations in addressing security and development issues; (2) the lack of research on this topic in the Russian science; (3) the need to improve joint approaches and develop mechanisms for responding to a wide range of global and national threats, which become interdependent, within the framework of the security-development context. With the initial focus on development, BRICS has come to an institutionalized approach to security, which is a vivid example of the implementation of the combination of security and development not only in theory in the form of a nexus, but also in practice. The analysis shows not only the evolution of the BRICS approaches to this problem, but also reflects aspects of security and development that BRICS needs to further develop in order to strengthen its positions in global politics and economics and to coordinate the organization's targeted programs to achieve optimal results. BRICS needs to strengthen the research on the preventive measures to predict global conflicts and to pay more attention to the implementation of projects under the "security-development" concept, which will enhance interstate cooperation and achieve sustainable peace in the regions of influence.

DE historiography; discourse; "national trauma"; agrarian colonization;
   steppe region
AB Based on the materials of the modem research tradition of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the authors of the article identify and justify the key approaches of national historians to assessing the causes and results of the agricultural colonization of the steppe region in the second half of the 19th to the early 20th centuries. The authors aim to restore the historical and contextual conditions of the formation of the modem Kazakhstan historiographic tradition, which influenced the formation of researchers' ideas about the process of colonization as imperial domination and compulsion towards the indigenous peoples of Central Asia. To reach the aim, the authors used the provisions and principles of the new cultural and intellectual history, the contextual approach in particular. This approach views the historiographic tradition as a form of social activity and part of a developed culture in connection with current social and political events and ideological conditions. The authors identify the main stages of the formation of modern historiography of the agricultural colonization of the steppe region in Kazakhstan. The starting point of the institutionalization of the modernized historiographic tradition in this matter was the collapse of the Soviet Union, the growth of ethnic identity, and the actualization of the traumatic experience of the Kazakh people, which was most pronounced in the materials of the national intelligentsia. Thus, the understanding of the historical experience of colonization in the Republic of Kazakhstan at the turn of the 21st century occurred in the projection of the colonial discourse with its inherent anxious mood. Post-Soviet researchers cover a wide range of issues related to the traumatic outcome of the colonial empire: the organization of administrative management, the relations of the indigenous population with the immigrants. In the national historiographic tradition of studying the agricultural colonization of the steppe region in the 1990s, the anti-colonial rhetoric of the late 19th to early 20th centuries was resumed, returning to the concept of colonization as an "absolute evil", which became the main argument of supporters of the "official" direction. Representatives of the "liberal" trend in the historiography of the Republic of Kazakhstan, accepting the theory of "relative" evil, only softened the unequivocally negative assessment of the practices of imperial colonization.

AB This paper sheds the light on the ongoing conflict between the two global powerhouses, the United States, and the Sino-Russian agreement, and how the latter is challenging the US economic hegemony by attempting to change the world's financial system. To better discuss this struggle, this paper will review the historical development of the financial system, its risks and challenges, the position of Russia and China in the current system, their motivations for the breaking out, and then decide whether this breakout is possible under the current circumstances. In order to do that, this study examines the Russian-American relationship, and the Chinese-American relationship to understand the differences and how each country functions toward the other. This paper will rely on neutral studies in an attempt to explain the reasons of this uprising. In addition, this study shows that either China, or Russia alone can challenge the United States hegemony, in fact, the Chinese economic power depend on the Russian political influence and vice versa. In the current moment, the Russian-Chinese alliance is not able to break out from the American hegemony as long as the dollar is still used as the global currency.

AB The article attempts to present the problem from a multidisciplinary perspective. It deals with the circumstances of the increasing influence of the extreme right flank of the party-political spectrum in the European Union countries - the instability of the world economy, a number of economic and socio-cultural factors. Among them there is not only the failure of the policies of national left forces (social democrats that have been in power in many EU countries for quite a long time), but also are new supranational factors. The role of the European Commission's deconstructive policy in the competition sphere in strengthening the positions of nationalist parties in the EU countries is highlighted. Specifics of terminology in definition of various kinds of nationalist forces in the EU are characterized. An analysis of the quantitative results of the 2019 election for nationalist parties demonstrates that the strengthening of their radical extreme right flank in six founding EU member states (Old Europe) is of special importance. The more heterogeneous composition of the European Parliament 2019-2024 compared to the past one is associated with the strengthening of the right-wing nationalist parties' positions. In the former socialist countries (New Europe), the situation is different: in Hungary and Poland (the two largest of them), the extreme right parties are pushed into the background owing to the unconditional victory of more moderate nationalist parties. Various kinds of right-wing forces are highlighted. The quantitative results of the EP election and the membership of its factions are presented separately for the six founding EU countries and for other member states; the election results are evaluated. Supranational legal rules that weaken the European Union need to be adjusted to reflect the new realities in the global economy and politics. This is one of the European Parliament's tasks for 2019-2024. Ignoring the emerging new realities creates the basis for the widespread growth of nationalism and the strengthening of nationalist parties' positions not only in the EP. It is concluded that the nationalist forces do not have a calculated long-term development strategy, which ensures the key role of moderate political forces in European politics.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE Eurasianism; Neo-Eurasianism; culture; ideology; discourse;
   conservatism; revanchism
AB The article discusses the correlation of Olzhas Suleimenov's cultural-historical conception (1975) with the Eurasian ideology of the 1920s-1930s and the influence of this conception on the formation of Neo-Eurasianism in post-Soviet Russia. The authors of the article conclude that, when creating this conception, Suleimenov was unfamiliar with the Eurasian doctrine. In particular, he was unaware of the ideologically biased concept of the Eurasian language union developed in 1931 by Roman Jakobson. Although the Eurasians considered the period of the Mongolian domination during the 13th-15th centuries as the key element in the formation of the "Eurasian nation", Suleimenov, however, credited the pre-Mongolian time as a period of the maximum cultural convergence of ancient Slays and ancient Turks. He even believed that the Mongolian conquest of Russia provoked the split of the sociocultural unity of the Slays and the Turks. Works by the Siberian oblastniks of the 19th century and Lev Gumilyov's early works also influenced Suleimenov's ideas to some extent. Suleimenov created his cultural-historical conception in the context of the "Left Renaissance" of the 1950s-1960s. The social and philosophical basis of this Renaissance was humanistic universalism, which considered all human-kind as a united planetary community of people equal in rights and moving towards a fair social system and democracy. Therefore, the statement of the long period of Old Slavic and Old Turkic cultures' interpenetration has an essentially different meaning for Suleimenov and for Eurasians. For the latter, it was an ideological support for the demonstration of the special way of Russian development; for the former, it was an ideological support of the prospects of the development of humankind as a united sociocultural community. The Eurasianism of the 1920s-1930s was an ultra-right, conservative reaction to the victory of the Bolsheviks. Neo-Eurasianism was also an ultra-right, conservative, revanchist reaction to the defeat of the USSR in the Cold War and the country's subsequent disintegration. The sociopolitical context at the turn of the 21st century formed the perception of the book AZ i Ya [AZ and I] that blurred its humanistic and leftist basis. As a result, for a long time, this book was wrongly perceived as being a product and part of the Eurasian intellectual tradition; in fact, it has nothing in common with this tradition. Suleimenov's ideas, meanwhile, significantly influenced the formation of the modern Republic of Kazakhstan's "Eurasian" state ideology. However, this ideology has little in common with classical Eurasianism and with modern Russian Neo-Eurasianism. Indeed, the political course adopted by President Nazarbayev could be termed as political pragmatism, i.e., using the Eurasian rhetoric to integrate Kazakhstan into the global economic and cultural space, a policy that evidently contradicts all Russian versions of Neo-Eurasianism.

DE media representation; discourse; religious consciousness; faith;

AB The study is devoted to a relevant topic - the analysis of the media representation of religiousness in modern Russian society based on media materials. In the scientific literature, there are various assessments of religious media discourse: some authors argue that the media reflect and others that the media distort the real situation. The study presents the idea that the ambiguity of assessments of the level of religiousness and its features is only partially explained by ideological differences between the discourses. To a large extent, such ambiguity is formed as a consequence of the instability of religious identification. Media materials note the superficial nature of religious consciousness, which is evidenced by the low level of churching, predominantly ceremonial nature of religious practice, and shallow knowledge of the essence of dogma However, according to the authors of the study, an insufficiently high level of religious culture should not be assessed as a profanation of faith. The analysis of the texts published in Russian printed and online media shows that the image of religiousness in the secular segment of the information field differs from the media of different political orientations.

DT Article
DE nationalism; ethnicity; ethnonationalism; civic nationalism;
   civilizational nationalism; racism; chauvinism; nativism; neonationalism
AB Nationalism is a highly heterogeneous concept that should be analyzed in the framework of both political psychology and ideological spectrum. The research aims, proceeding from the already existing approaches to conceptualization and typologizing of nationalism and adding some new variables (both political and psychological), to identify the main types of this phenomenon. From a psychological point of view, nationalism should be regarded through the lens of a frustration-aggression theory introduced by J. Dollard and N. Miller. Ideologically, nationalism is not a fully-fledged set of ideas, but just a thin-centered ideology that may be combined with more developed ideological paradigms. One cannot define nationalism per se, but just its distinct types; an umbrella definition is impossible to formulate due to the significant differences between the types. The existing typologies of nationalism are based on subjects and objects of nationalist feeling, and also on the aims of a nationalist movement. Since nationalism generally means a maximum loyalty towards a certain social phenomena and negative sentiments towards some external group, the research identifies ethnonationalist, civic, racist, civilizational and nativist types of nationalism. The concepts of chauvinism, cultural racism and neonationalism are also scrutinized and considered excessive.

AB The study is devoted to a key aspect of social policy of anti-Bolshevik governments in the East of Russia-workers' social insurance. The author focused on the most important type of insurance-the health one-because unemployment insurance demands a special study. The problem has been researched fragmentarily so far; and, in Soviet times, historians had a prejudiced attitude to it. This study rests on an extensive source base, which includes laws, publications in periodicals and documents of four archives. The structure of the study comprises a review of the history of health insurance formation in Russia, the influence of the 1917 revolution on health insurance, the state of insurance institutions in the eastern regions of Russia just before the opponents of the Bolsheviks came to power. The attempts to reform the sickness funds of Komuch and the Provisional Regional Government of the Urals are studied. The preparation of normative and instructive materials of the Russian government in the field of workers' and employees' health insurance is examined in detail, and the materials are analyzed in terms of law. The author shows the attitude of different groups of the population to the ongoing reforms, the complexity of the implementation of laws and government orders at the central and provincial/regional levels. Owners of ruined enterprises were not able to pay even reduced fees. Stabilization of social payments contradicted economic logic. As a result, a great deal of entrepreneurs evaded payments of insurance payments. Trade unions and other workers' organizations rejected the authorities' desire to equalize the financial and organizational participation of employers and employees in insurance institutions as a curtailment of revolutionary gains. In the context of acute social confrontation, a full-fledged social partnership, even with the mediation of government representatives, had no chance of success. Nevertheless, in the first half of 1919, there was a relative and short-term stabilization of the situation with sickness funds in the East of Russia, interrupted by the rapid retreat of the White Army to the East, the increased inflation and the falling living standards. The conducted reforms were designed for the post-war settlement of the social situation to a greater extent, but could not lead to the expected results during the Civil War. The author concludes that, before the revolution, the regulatory framework of health insurance in Russia was elaborated in detail. Thus, the successively occurring political regimes in 1917-1920s did not annul the regulatory framework, but supplemented and changed it.

AB The article is devoted to a comparative legal study of the European principle of proportionality and the American method of weighing interests, their origins, common and distinctive features, socio-cultural and historical foundations, the application of the principle of proportionality in the Russian legal order. Historically, the origins (roots) of the European principle of proportionality go back to the German administrative-legal doctrine, and the American method of weighing as an initial principle is associated with private law and only later was extended to the public law sphere. The article assesses the impact of these principles on the Russian legal doctrine and law enforcement practice.
   Purpose: The main purpose of the article is to identify the general and distinctive features of the European principle of proportionality and the American method of balancing interests in order to comprehend on this basis the Russian legal model for ensuring the balance of private and public interests. Tasks: to explore the historical, socio-cultural, doctrinal foundations of the genesis of the European principle of proportionality and the American method of weighing interests; to identify the common and special features characteristic of these methods; to show the influence of these methods on Russian doctrine and law enforcement practice; compare the Russian principle of balance between private and public interests with the European principle of proportionality; formulate recommendations and suggestions for improving Russian law enforcement practice.
   Methods: historical and legal, logical, formal and legal, systemic and structural, method of interdisciplinary legal research, method of system analysis. Discussion: the European principle of proportionality and the American method of weighing interests, although they do not belong to new phenomena of legal thought, nevertheless, due to their fundamental importance both at the constitutional and other sectoral levels of development of law, are constantly in the center of the field of vision of legal thought abroad, as well as in Russia. The emergence of various approaches to understanding the legal provision of the balance of private and public interests is causing lively, sometimes quite sharp, discussions in the scientific field. The article focuses on the historical, socio-cultural, political and legal features of the development of the European principle of proportionality and the American method of balancing interests, which leads to both close interaction and convergence, as well as the need for their joint scientific research, which can give a significant theoretical and practical effect.
   Conclusion: the article states that the distinctive features of the European principle of proportionality and the American method of weighing interests are not of an essential, paradigmatic nature, which allows us to conclude that in this case there are no grounds for a fundamental opposition to each other of the above-named constructive models as methods of understanding legal reality, as well as legal means of ensuring a balance of private and public interests. The development of the European principle of proportionality has a significant impact and impact on the formation of Russian political and legal thought and practice in the field of interaction between private and public law, ensuring an organic combination of private and public interests, which is reflected in the legal position formulated by the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation concerning the principle of ensuring proportional observance, balance of private and public interests in the implementation of legal regulation of public relations.

DE myth; values; culture; choice; rationality; ideology; social philosophy
AB In everyday usage, myth is a synonym for an unreliable story and fiction. For the later romantics, myth was a legend, a symbolic expression of certain events that took place among certain peoples at a certain time, at the dawn of their history. At present, people are talking about the mythologization of well-known concepts, due to which the phenomena underlying these concepts, being rationally imperceptible, require an awed attitude. Such concepts can be, for example, the concept of the state, people, society, technology. In contrast, demythologization is discussed to the extent that some of the inherited religious-mythological views and concepts, in contrast to their mythical content, must be explained according to the historical reasons underlying them. There is a plurality of interpretations of the essence of the mythological, different theories of myth. In the article, myth and the mythological are interpreted as a cultural form of the existence of values. Values are the ultimate basis of human choice. In this thesis lies the answer why mythological thinking, from the moment of its appearance to the present day, imbues the world with meaning setting and goal setting. Values mark the limits of humanization of the world opposed to man. Historically, two cultural matrices are constituted: the value choice matrix and the rational choice matrix. All significant social changes accompany conflicts arising between these cultural forms. The forms of direct representation of myth and the mythological can be a narrative or a concept. In the latter case, it is customary to use the concept of ideology. Myth always plays a significant role in social life, serving as a basis of human activity. If there are new tasks that are not justified by the existing mythology, then a new mythology is formed. Yet this new mythology necessarily includes the element of the impossible.

   (subjectively non-oriented) paradigm; subjectively oriented paradigm
AB The development of technology affects the nature of social relations, which clearly demonstrates the format of social dynamics (traditional society - agrarian society - industrial society - postindustrial society - information society, etc.). The most modem technologies, which are generally characterized as smart technologies today, contribute to the formation of a new type of society-smart society. Such processes significantly affect such a social institution as education and lead to the emergence of smart education. The aim of the publication is to define smart education as a new educational paradigm and also to clarify whether this paradigm contains new meanings and values for society or not. The main research methods used in the article are the conceptual-notional analysis and a comparative approach. During the study, the potential of etymological analysis was used. As a result of the study, the criterion of the subject was used to determine educational paradigms. On this basis, the authors identify two main educational paradigms: "knowledge" (subjectively non-oriented) and subjectively oriented. The purpose of education in the framework of the first paradigm is to obtain knowledge, and in the framework of the second paradigm it is the development of the subject (person, group, community) as a person, or his/her personal characteristics. In the process of historical development, the first paradigm has become an integral part of the second paradigm. The active use of smart technologies (smart education) does not lead to a change in the purpose of education; therefore, it cannot be unambiguously recognized as a new educational paradigm. But such a course of development is not excluded and will be quite possible if our understanding of the subject changes. At the moment, the most effective way to use smart education is to use the latter in relation to traditional education. The results obtained in the first place have conceptual consequences and methodological significance associated with understanding the place and role of smart technologies in the implementation of the educational process at any level (primary, secondary, higher), as well as the formation of awareness of the fact that it is not necessary to exaggerate the role of the technological factor in the learning process and the risk of underestimating the latter in its influence on the nature of socialization in modem society.

AB The main aim of the article is to scrutinize the importance of China's center of power within the framework of social and political changes of the contemporary world. The following methods of research were used: theoretical, historical, economic and statistical analyses, comparative, structure-functional and factorial methods. It is stated that China's economic and military build-up is a factor of social and political changes in the international arena. Among the factors affecting political and economic changes in the political system of the PRC as the article notes are the influence of traditionalism and soft power. The authors arrived at several conclusions. (1) Confucian values, inherent in China's management culture, involve ideological influence over the Chinese form of government, which is connected with the CPC dictatorship. (2) The article reveals the growing influence of China on global economic and political processes. (3) The present-day political process implies the Chinese political leadership (the political leadership of China).

DE non-ethnic migrants; Central Asia; survey; cluster analysis; typology
ID ATTITUDES
AB The intensity of migration flows to the territory of Europe and Russia determines the relevance of identifying types of migrants because their belonging to different groups affects the effectiveness of their integration into the host society. In the article, the author identifies three typological groups of migrants from Central Asian countries, differently related to life in Russia based on cluster analysis: temporarily settled; not settled; settled forever. The features of each group are described. The first cluster is characterized by a combination of instrumental readiness to live in Russia and a lack of readiness to move to Russia forever. The unwillingness to move to Russia for permanent residence is accompanied by a pretty good knowledge of the Russian language and Russian laws, a fairly high level of education in this group. The second cluster, vice versa, is characterized by a high level of the desire to move to Russia and a low instrumental readiness to move. In this group, the goal to stay in Russia is not yet accompanied by the availability of information and educational resources necessary to achieve it. Migrants belonging to the third cluster demonstrate a high level of development of both types of preparedness, accompanied by a high assessment of the culture of Ekaterinburg residents' behavior, a widespread willingness to change cultural habits, and agreement that Russian culture should occupy a leading place in Russia. The number of observed national traditions and interest in their national history are the highest in this cluster compared to the other two clusters. It does not prevent the entry into a new cultural environment and creates opportunities for the preservation of native national culture. The revealed typology makes it possible to understand that the representatives of the cluster "settled forever" have the most positive attitude to life in Russia. This is manifested not only in the evaluation characteristics of the attitude to the local population, Russian culture, but also in the behavioral characteristics: the development of resources necessary for life in Yekaterinburg, the desire to live in Russia permanently, to obtain Russian citizenship. The authors' hypothesis that the desire of migrants to participate in the integration processes has a cultural basis has been confirmed. This is proved by the results of quantitative and qualitative analysis based on in-depth interviews.

   theory of polymedia
AB Computer-mediated communication (CMC) systems have been the focus of researchers' attention in various fields of knowledge for several decades: from cultural anthropology to cybernetics, from sociology to psychology of mass communications, etc. A special place here is occupied by the media richness theory of American scientists Richard Daft and Robert Langel (1986), which was developed in 2012 as a construct of polymedia in the concept of British experts Mirka Madian and Daniel Miller. The article presents the results of quantitative (a quantitative survey of 322 respondents was carried out) and qualitative (semi-structured interviews (writing an essay) with 50 respondents were organized and conducted) research. Its participants were bachelor's and master's students of six Tomsk universities: National Research Tomsk State University, National Research Tomsk Polytechnic University, Tomsk State Pedagogical University, Siberian State Medical University, Tomsk State University of Control Systems and Radioelectronics, and Tomsk State University of Architecture and Building. The aim of this research is to verify certain provisions of the above-mentioned theoretical position. As a result of the data obtained, it is possible to confirm that the respondents find it important to use the entire repertoire of new media with the intended purpose of their emotional register: nowadays, CMC is not just an integral part of the life of the youth; it is actively used to form interpersonal relationships of their actors online and offline. The position of the media (polymedia) richness theory on the resocialization of social platforms and messengers has been confirmed: people are increasingly using the potential of the polymedia structure to build their relationships; when affordance becomes a quality, we use a person-person interaction rather than a person-computer one). Using the potential of the new media, young men and women manage their communications focusing on the degree of closeness to the partner in their communnicative interaction, on the assessment of the degree of uncertainty in the emerging communication situation, on the level of resource consumption of particular media, on the mandatory ethical aspect of communication linking formats, the technical potential of their devices, selected social platforms and messengers with the concept of decency.

DE history of philosophy; historian of philosophy; subject; teleology;
   history of ideas; modernity; political economy
AB The article discusses the experience of Michel Foucault's appeal to liberal economic theory, which became his way to avoid subject metaphysics and teleological history. The author shows how Foucault, after going through a series of searches in the 1960s, ascertained the death of a subject who had been a central figure in European philosophy since Descartes. For Foucault, this statement was a rejection of the metaphysics of the New Time and the definition of his place in history as a postmodern one. In his later works, Foucault replaces the sovereign subject with a multiple and pluralistic model of subjectivity. The transition from the register of the history of philosophy to the register of the history of ideas allowed him to move away from the metaphysics of the subject into the space of positive knowledge, but the methodology and ideological position of a historian of philosophy provided him immunity from teleological history. Thus, as the author demonstrates, Foucault represents a type of a nomadic intellectual who is constantly moving along the disciplinary grid, but simultaneously maintains conceptual and ideological constancy by virtue of his affiliation with a particular professional group. It can be quite reasonably argued that in Foucault's later works there was no resurrection of the subject, but there was a transfer of the problem of subjectivity to another register-from the register of metaphysics to the register of political economy. Using the term of Bruno Latour, we should recall his very insightful remark that transferring an instance from a register to a register also requires transferring the conceptual apparatus used to fix it, which inevitably leads to the transformation of the instance itself. This is what happens with Foucault's subject: moving from the register of philosophy to the register of political economy, the subject transforms in such a way that the criticism addressed to him in the philosophical register does not reach him. In an effort to get away from subject metaphysics and teleological history, Foucault transforms the register of the history of philosophy into the register of the history of ideas, which allows him to leave behind a number of questions of philosophical order, the development of which implies the metaphysics Foucault wanted to discard. Engaged in the history of ideas, Foucault remains a historian of philosophy with regard to the method and goals, which provides him with immunity from the inborn vices of historical science.

AB The article shows that the reliance on subject-object dualism, which is widespread in the contemporary analytic philosophy of mind and is fuelled by classical epistemology, leads to a large number of theories based on epistemic contradictions. To illustrate this statement, the first- and second-order cybernetics apparatus (FOC and SOC) was used (Foester 1975). It is shown that the majority of modern analytical contexts working with mind are oriented to the so-called first-order cybernetics. Accordingly, the study suggests that if we replace FOC with SOC, we will get a more adequate epistemology and will be able to avoid unproductive work on creating contradictory or inoperative theories. In particular, it is stated that using SOC one can build a model that differs from traditional (subject-object) models and propose a theory of the self-description of mind, which removes the division into a subject and an object, but deals with a self-understanding mind, organized as a total and immanent sphere of meanings-differences. The critical part of the study substantiates the irrelevance of the naturalist apparatus borrowed from the natural sciences. It is considered that to thematize a subject epistemology must construct a special language of description taking into account the specifics of the subjective measurement of reality. In particular, it is shown that the study of mind is the area of knowledge where the level of observer should be taken into account in the first place because the failure to take into account this level instantly leads to any theory of mind to paradoxes. The study points to the need to take into account the criticism of subject-object dualism undertaken by second-order cybernetics and shows what unproductive epistemological assumptions its non-acceptance in the study of consciousness leads to. It is considered that in dualistic models cognitive sciences implicitly conceal the notion of mind itself as a dualistic model, in which reflexion is possible only as meta-knowledge. Accordingly, it is shown that speaking about the self-description (reflexion) of mind itself, it is inefficient to speak about the meta-linguistic structure: when one tries to explain reflexion in the subject-object paradigm (in which there is a mind-object and a mind-subject independent of it), a paradox emerges. The positive part of the study, also using the positions of second-order cybernetics, explains why it is unproductive to see some essence in mind and shows how one could speak about mind using the apparatus of differences. In this part of the study, an attempt is made to attribute mind to autopoietic systems, namely, to understand how it describes itself. Self-description is considered at two levels: (1) the local level of mind inherent in a certain carrier and (2) the global level of mind as a field of meanings in general, which tries to form knowledge about itself. Self-description is supposed to be understood as a way to address oneself by distinguishing some states from others (Luhmann 1990, 1995). It is shown that at the local level of cognition we fundamentally differentiate ourselves in order to form objects and at the limit of the entire reality with which we deal. It has been analyzed that the minimum basic level of cognition is the ability to distinguish and separate one from another (for example, when we understand something, we understand that it is not that either). It is stated that this is how perception becomes information.

DE modern educational practices; philosophy of education; Liberal Arts
   model; human potential; ethics of education
AB The study of educational practices in dynamics is one of the main challenges that modern researchers face all over the world today. New practices arise, are introduced and disappear at such a high speed that large groups of researchers around the globe do not have enough time to fix and describe the processes of their changes. The work of such groups is hampered by the lack of a modem methodology that responds to the needs of research. In the author's opinion, such methodology may be grounded on philosophical foundations of educational practices, for it is philosophy that has the necessary conceptual and categorical apparatus for studying the evolving processes in their dynamics. The most relevant trends in modern education, which, in the author's opinion, require philosophical reflection, are: (1) general transition to the Economy of Knowledge and, as a consequence, the strengthening of the requirements for the practical applicability of knowledge (sometimes in detriment to the theoretical knowledge); (2) a large-scale implementation of the Liberal Arts model, which involves setting specific tasks for students, instead of lecture training. A natural foundation for such reflection would be the model of open education-a model of individually oriented pedagogy. The ontological reflection of modern educational practices' philosophical grounds should be aimed at opposing the utilitarian approach by identifying the intrinsic value of subjects and courses that seem "unprofitable", "unprestigious" at first glance. Thus, alignment of educational practices along the path of their anthropological value will ensure their universality by transmitting the idea of the timeless nature of this value. An important aspect of comprehending modern educational practices should be their ethical component since individualization of education presupposes students' self-development when ethical standards can no longer be given didactically, from outer sources. In the author's opinion, the study of modern educational practices can be based on the following aspects: (1) the anthropological value of a practice-whether it develops the human potential or not; (2) the requirement of timelessness - the ability of a practice not only to satisfy students' immediate interests, but also to transmit timeless values; (3) the well-thought protection of a practice from its "inappropriate" use; (4) the clarity of the practice's ethical framework for all participants in the educational process.

DE competitiveness; competitive ability; definition; etymon; concept
AB The study of the concept "competitiveness" is relevant for it has no universal definition despite the fact that it is widely used in transdisciplinary research. On the one hand, the concept "competitiveness" is fixed and common in social practices. On the other hand, the use of two ways of writing this concept (competitiveness and competitive ability) indicates the insufficient degree of research. The classical approach dominates in the existing definitions; it implies only external, quantitative or qualitative indicators of measuring success. This classical approach is radical. Thus, the existing definitions do not reflect the pluralistic nature of the concept, do not consider its two dimensions: external (classical) and internal (non-classical) components. The absence of specific definitions can be explained by the fact that the concept "competitiveness" ("competitive ability") is not an independent category; it often performs the function of an attribute of a person (state, company) and is evaluated solely by the parameter of the success of the result. This assessment of the subject of competitiveness is narrow and does not allow a complete understanding of the nature of the success of the obtained result; therefore, there is no holistic understanding of this phenomenon. The radical classical interpretation of the concept produces a side effect. That is, those who are left behind in the competition fall out of the process of social life and become outsiders. In many ways, victory or defeat in the classical understanding of competitiveness is determined by social standards and expectations. In this regard, the socio-philosophical aspect of competitiveness seems to be very relevant due to the fact that a person and his/her existence appear differently in the context of this perspective. The value of a human decision or deed is self-sufficient and precious, it is not determined by the will of the majority. On the contrary, human uniqueness and individuality are opposed to various social norms. Therefore, from this position, the classical interpretation of competition and competitiveness is unacceptable because it reduces human uniqueness and identity to social norms.

AB The article provides a general description of a subjective foundation, which is definitive for relations between flagship universities and the regional economic infrastructure in Russia. Russian flagship universities are a new element in the development of regional innovative processes since they act as a link between higher engineering education, the government, society, and business. The aim of this work is to reveal the subjective foundation within the functional ties of a flagship university. This foundation determines the processes of social diversification, social integration, and social development in a given region. The subject of the study, thus, is highly relevant. At the same time, there have been few publications, which systematically addressed relations between flagship universities and society. The selected methodological basis for the investigation is the theory of post-industrial society. There are three independent thematic units in the article: (1) the description of the general problem of the development of the subjective foundation in the process of the flagship university's operation; (2) the role of scientific knowledge in creating and using current volumes of information; (3) the philosophical and worldview aspects of the development of subjective foundations in modern social practices. After a critical analysis of relevant publications on intersectoral integration, the authors have focused on situations which discuss the activities of small creative teams, consisting of university academics, students, young engineers, and sector specialists, who are capable of (in terms of solving a regional problem) selecting a research strategy independently. It is very important for the participants of such teams to be able to think from the position of advanced rational values of post-classical science. Thus, the complex interaction of multidisciplinary, general scientific, and socio-philosophical components in the relations between a university and its intersectoral environment is a most important functional characteristic of the subjective foundation of a flagship university. In this article, special attention is paid to the problem of balance between scientific knowledge and information, along with the influence of this correlation on the innovative changes in social practices. The methodological criterion of obtaining results is the accepted postulate that modern scientific knowledge is the basis for information production and consumption. The study of modern literature on this issue has allowed the authors to make the following conclusion. First, the most stable properties of the object under investigation at the previous stage of its existence are studied. Then, an innovative supplement is developed to informatively perfect the processes of the complex organization of the system. The three dimensions (the scientific ideas of organization, information and communication technologies, and development mechanisms) are brought together into one intellectual assessment of the result. Special attention is paid to the philosophical and methodological investigations of the subjective foundation of a flagship university in connection with its strengthening influence on the development of quantitative and qualitative parameters of social practices in a specific region. This aspect of the investigation of the functional development of a flagship university is primarily aimed at confirming new rationalistic scientific values.
   In relation to the process of functioning of the flagship university's subjective foundation, the authors have specified the problem of reaching a unity between inner scientific and sociocultural changes introduced by the post-classical scientific revolution into the region's development. In this part of the article, the authors have come to the conclusion that the development principle of a specific economic region must correspond to a specific philosophical thought, which is determined according to a methodological foundation. The choice of a philosophical and worldview model for the economic development of a specific region requires taking into consideration its historical and economic experience. Acquiring relevant meaning in one or another project in history, economic science is built either on a metaphysical (representative) system, or on a dialectic style of scientific knowledge. For the metaphysical style, the key principles are agnosticism, dualism, and anthropocentrism. Dialectics, on the contrary, understands knowledge acquisition as based on the principle of world unity, a universal connection between all phenomena, and the principle of reflection. Depending on the abilities and level of a university's scholarly team, either of the two philosophical ideas may be used to understand economic development.

DE privacy; mind; language; philosophy of mind; philosophy of language
AB In this article, the author considers the privacy of mind thesis in the philosophy of mind and in the philosophy of language. She argues that this thesis is inconsistent, and its inconsistency becomes clear when the thesis passes to the philosophy of language. The first part of the article examines the thesis itself and the problems this thesis causes in the philosophy of mind. The author provides the general definition of privacy, i.e., an object might be considered private if there is only one agent who has a direct epistemic access to it. Then, she analyzes the relations between the privacy of mind thesis, the transparency thesis, and the privileged access thesis. She presents Alfred Jules Ayer's four criteria of privacy and demonstrates that these criteria do not help to distinguish between private and public objects. The second part of the article deals with the three main implications of the privacy of mind for the philosophy of language. The author argues that it is these implications that have led to the rejection of this thesis. The first implication concerns dualism in descriptive languages implied by the opposition between private / mental objects and public/physical objects. These languages seem to be untranslatable into each other giving rise to attempts to construct a single unified language. The author gives an example of Rudolf Carnap's project of reducing sentences about agent's mental states to sentences about his / her physical states. The second implication is about restrictions that the privacy of mind places on the conception of ostensive definition. The reason for that is that it is unclear how to refer to private mental objects and gain knowledge about them. Here, the author discusses Ludwig Wittgenstein's criticism of the conception of ostensive definition. The third implication involves the revision of self-knowledge. Given the refusal of the privacy of mind, one tends to construct the concept of self-knowledge as a linguistic practice of mental self-ascriptions. Gareth Evans and Sydney Shoemaker exemplify this tendency while criticizing the perceptive model of self-knowledge and rejecting the idea of a metaphysical referent, i.e., the self, in such kind of knowledge. The author briefly concludes that the philosophy of language revealed and proved the inconsistency of the privacy of mind thesis, which in turn resulted in a new idea of the linguistic nature of mind.

AB The article considers a number of lyric works by Igor Severyanin written from a woman's face and representing such conventional mask types as "socialite", "exalted lady" or "emancipated woman". These poems are analyzed in historical-literary and sociocultural aspects. Their interrelations with such a bright phenomenon of the Russian Silver Age as a sharp increase in women's poetic and prose writings are considered. Severyanin's works, speaking to the reader on behalf of women, reflect the so-called "women's question": the problems of female sexuality, self-realization, creative, social, political, and professional activity. If female authors (E. Nagrodskaya, A. Verbitskaya, G. Galina, N. Grushko, M. Zakrevskaya-Reich, and others) seriously reflected on the above-mentioned issues, Severyanin's poems always reflect a defamiliarized ironic author's view. The author's position is manifested in stylistic shifts, logical inconsistencies and paradoxes, exaggeration and hyperbolization of images and pathos, increased expressiveness of lyric intonation. Similar artistic techniques can be noted in some of the poet's texts written from a man's face but depicting female types of the era ("In the Birch Cottage", "Nelly", "Zizi", "Courtesan's Carriage"). But they are no less noticeable in the texts in which the author allows the woman to speak, for example, "Autumnal Berceuse", "Oblivion in Sin", "M-me Sans-Gene". The latter poem by its very name, "M-me Sans-Gene", refers to the same-name play, popular at the turn of the 20th century, by French playwrights Victorien Sardou and Emile Moreau and literally translates as "Madame Unceremoniousness", "Madame Tactlessness". The plot of the comedy is based on the story of the laundress Catherine Hubscher, who became the wife of Napoleon's Marshal Francois Joseph Lefebvre. For many ladies of the 19th century, Catherine became a model of an "emancipated woman". Severyanin takes this type of the end of the 18th century to the beginning of the 20th century and creates a story about adventures of Madame Sans-Gene in the exotic Mexico. The new historical and geographical context allows him to draw a caricature of modern feminists, using the literary baggage of a well-known cultural type. This work also combines the features of poetics of Balmont, known for his poetic accounts of trips to distant countries, and techniques of parody responses to Balmont's lyrics, for example, Alexander Blok's parody about his trips called "Balmont's Correspondence from Mexico" (1905). Severyanin's experience in the construction of a female subject in the lyrics influenced the experiments of Valery Bryusov (poetic collection New Poems of Nelly) and some poems of the poetess Nadezhda Lvova. Thus, interacting with both mass and "high" poetry, Severyanin creates multifaceted works that ironically reflect the contemporary literary process.

DE late capitalism; territoriality; rhizome; network society; social
   transformation
AB The article presents an analysis of the concept "late capitalism" by Werner Sombart. In his writings, Sombart investigated the structure and functioning of society at certain stages of its development, the capitalist economic system in particular. Sombart's main works are related to the most important issues of socio-humanistic cognition since the subject of, primarily, economic theoretical reconstruction is the modern type of public, dependent on the historical genesis and transformation of capitalism. Sombart identifies three main factors covering the content of the concept "late capitalism": territorial transformations, form transformation, and area transformations. Thus, he focused on the factors that are constitutional for the formulation of new forms of capitalist relations. Turning to the terminology of territoriality, Sombart began to develop the idea of destroying traditional representations about the centralized structure of the world structure, which suggests the axial orientation of developing countries to the West. Somewhat later, the ontological perspective of spatial connections and relationships was developed in terms of postmodern philosophy, in which space is viewed through the prism of an existential dimension. In their work "Rhizome", Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari suggest looking at the structure of the world order in a special way. The world can be polycentric, it can grow and develop from each individual local area. It may be missing some pronounced consistency and unity. And if the world is really like that, then it can no longer be understood in the context of its unity, it cannot be comprehended by traditional categories of thinking. The authors manage to illustrate the distinctive features of the rhizomorphic organization of the world and reflect the need to rethink the usual reality. It was this tendency that Sombart pointed out in his research in the first half of the 20th century.

TI PERCEPTION OF UNEMPLOYMENT BY EUROPEANS

DE unemployment rate; perception of unemployment; fear of unemployment;
   misperception; cross-country comparisons; European social survey;
   economic behavior
AB The unemployment rate is one of the key labor market indicators, which contains information about labor market activity and overall state of the economy. This information is important for economic decisions made by governments, businesses and private individuals. However, individuals rely on what they believe the unemployment to be, and those beliefs might differ a lot from the official statistics. The perception of unemployment is influenced by different country- and individual-specific factors that can make low unemployment seem high and potentially distort people's behavior. This paper studies perception of unemployment in European countries and explores the factors affecting it. The dataset comes from the European Social Survey (ESS) and covers two years: 2008 and 2016. The paper has three main results: 1) in all the countries in the sample, perceived unemployment is higher than the actual one; 2) the degree of misperception varies across countries and socio-demographic groups; 3) the same conclusions hold for both years in the sample. The author finds that the perceptual errors are the smallest in the Scandinavian countries, Switzerland and the Czech Republic. The degree of misperception is the highest in Southern Europe, Slovenia and Russia. These crosscountry differences hold for both years in the sample. One of the main factors affecting perception of unemployment is the actual unemployment rate: the higher the actual level, the higher its perception. Another important factor is sustained economic growth: the countries with stable economy are less prone to overestimating unemployment. The socio-political context also contributes to how people perceive economic indicators. In particular, the general state of anxiety in society makes people more pessimistic in how they assess economic conditions. Perceptual errors vary across social groups between and within countries. Individuals with weak positions in the labor market (e.g. women, young people) are more likely to overstate unemployment. Their misperception might be due to a lower level of education, previous unemployment experience, temporary contracts, health problems.

AB The author analyzes the concept of linguistic imperialism by Robert Phillipson and proposes an idea of linguistic sub-imperialism. Serving the communicative needs of people, uniting in the context of globalization, necessarily leads to the growth of the influence of English as a global language as well as of other languages of the major nations: French, Spanish, German, Russian, Chinese, etc. Wikipedia, which has already become the leading encyclopedia of the humankind, can serve as an indicator of different languages' influence. We can judge about the development of Wikipedia sections in different languages, firstly, by the number of articles in the sections, secondly, by the average quality of these articles, and, thirdly, by the rate of the increase in the number of articles. The author suggests determining the average quality of articles in Wikipedia sections using the method he developed. A comparative analysis of Wikipedia sections in different languages shows the immense superiority of English over the rest of the languages in the world, on the one hand, and the tremendous value of the large nations' languages, on the other. English as a means of worldwide communication is unparalleled, and the potential for its influence is rapidly increasing. Russian maintains its strong position on the territory of the post-Soviet Union: in all respects the usage of Wikipedia in Russian is far ahead of Wikipedia in the languages of other peoples of the territory. The author analyzes the language practices of the peoples of the republics of the Russian Federation (Bashkortostan, Tatarstan, Tuva, Chuvashia, and Yakutia) using the data of the social network VKontakte. These practices and the analysis of Wikipedia in the languages of these republics discover the dominant orientation of the peoples of the republics to the use of Russian. The analysis of ethnolinguistic processes in two autonomous communities of Spain (Catalonia and the Basque Country) and the comparison of the development of Wikipedia in Spanish, Catalan, and Basque show us the inevitability of the predominance of Spanish in the language practices of Catalonia and the Basque Country. The author comes to a conclusion that linguistic imperialism and linguistic sub-imperialism are necessary in the conditions of globalization. At the same time, the undisputed goal of the worldwide language policy is to preserve the linguistic diversity of the world.

DE Soviet historical science; Mikhail Pokrovsky; Russia; Entente; First
   World War
AB The aim of the article is to consider the views of Mikhail Pokrovsky on the role of Russia in the Entente as they are not sufficiently covered in the scientific literature. The issues of relations between Russia and the allies-Britain and France-were in demand in the early Soviet historiography in connection with the tasks of identifying positions of Russia in the system of European imperialism, the study of the history of the First World War. Pokrovsky turned to the problem of balance of power in the Entente in many of his works devoted to the foreign policy of Russia in the early 20th century and the history of the Russian revolutionary movement. He expressed his views before the revolution, but mostly developed the problem in the Soviet period. Pokrovsky's works reflected the specific historiographical situation of 1918 - early 1930s, associated with the adoption of Marxism in historical science, changes in the internal and external political life of the country. In addition, Pokrovsky was extremely biased and inconsistent in his judgments, which prevented a holistic understanding of the scientific problem. He was contradictory in assessing the specifics of Russian imperialism, the degree of Russia's responsibility for the outbreak of the First World War. At the same time, we can talk about the development of his views and general conceptual points in different periods. Pokrovskygave an ambiguous assessment to the position of Russia in the Entente. In economic terms, he did not consider Russia as an equal ally of England and France, but never questioned its diplomatic role, the ability to influence the allies and defend its interests. This contradiction between the economic and diplomatic status of Russia was reflected in Pokrovsky's determination of the decisive factor of Russia's entry into the First World War. In 1918-1926, he considered the impact of the global economic situation; from 1927, the economic dependence on the allies; in 1932, Russia's own tasks. Pokrovsky's contradictory views were interpreted by his contemporaries in different ways depending on the requirements of the time. In the late 1920s, Pokrovsky was credited for his thesis of Russia's dependent position in the Entente; in the early 1930s, against the background of the struggle against Trotskyism, for the opposite thesis about the independent interests of Russia in the international arena. With the publication of the book The History of the CPSU(b). A Short Course, Pokrovsky's views were severely criticized, though some of his conclusions corresponded to the basic ideas of the book and the new historiographical situation. Pokrovsky's works became an important milestone in the conceptual understanding of Russia's foreign policy of the early 20th century and its role in the Entente from Marxist positions. Pokrovsky identified the main problematic issues and directions of scientific research.

DE Friedrich Nietzsche; Nietzscheanism; positivism; pessimism; resentment
AB This article focuses on Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophy in the period of its transition from the early problems of the first texts, the most famous of which is The Birth of Tragedy from the Spirit of Music (1872), to the second period, namely, a positivist turn taking place since the release of Human, All Too Human (1878). Several factors, including the expansion of his natural-science library, cause changes in Nietzsche's ideas. Thus, we need to examine authors relevant to the philosopher at that time. Eugene Duhring (1833-1921) is one of these important figures. His name is found in Nietzsche's diaries of 1875. In this period, Nietzsche also wrote a summary of Duhring's book Der Wert des Lebens (The Value of Life) (1865). References to Duhring still appear in later Nietzsche's texts, up to his final Ecce Homo (1888). Due to Nietzsche's close attention to Duhring, there is a need to make a historical and philosophical research to answer a few questions. The first one is why Duhring was so important for Nietzsche. The second is which Duhring's ideas influenced Nietzsche's philosophy, beginning with Thus Spoke Zarathustra (1883). This study is based on the textual analysis of Der Wert des Lebens and compares key fragments of this book with Nietzsche's reflections after 1875. The analysis of the texts shows that Nietzsche develops his ideas such as resentment, nihilism, overman. in polemics with Wiring. Moreover, key topics of Nietzsche's works, e.g., overcoming cultural decline, coincide with the main themes of airing's book. It is argued that Nietzsche's ideas are formed by reflection on Der Wert des Lebens. Duhring influenced the genesis of Nietzsche's thought by introducing important philosophical problems relevant for the intellectual sphere of the time. Furthermore, Duhring is one of the figures who gave Nietzsche specific medical terminology and helped Nietzsche to develop his own fundamental concepts, some aspects of which were taken from Daring's book.

DE musical meaning; language; interpretation; cultural code
AB Research into the processes of meaning formation in music should focus on the communicative basis of this type of art. A person comes to the fore as a perceived subject whose consciousness constructs meanings in the process of cultural interaction with the external environment. It is necessary to study how musical meanings are formed in human consciousness when composing and listening to various kinds of musical works. The concepts of three major semiotic traditions were used to divide the complex process of interpretation in musical art into separate levels and to study it in more detail in this article. The logical-philosophical semiotic tradition explores meaning at the level of a single sign in terms of subject-object relations. The key point here is the connection of human mind with the outside world, the perception of reality through a set of signals that affect feelings and cause certain reactions. At the single sign level, it is possible to investigate the primary association of musical sounds as signal-index means with a human body and the creation of basic synesthetic associative images. The linguo-centrist semiotic tradition links the formation of meanings to the structural features of the language system adopted for communication in a social group. At this level, it is impossible to study musical syntax as a way to organize primary sound material. The information semiotic tradition proposes to consider musical meaning as a product of the action of various cultural codes in communication. Attention is focused on the perceiving subject, the impact of the cultural environment on their consciousness, and the availability of certain codes to interpret musical messages. By graded analysis of musical works of different complexity levels, the formation of a field of meanings attributed to these compositions can be traced more accurately. This will allow a better understanding of the nature of musical meaning as a multiple interpretation.

DE understanding; proof; semantics; syntax; notation; interpretation
AB The interpretation of the nature of mathematical proof contrasts its two interpretations: as understanding and as calculations. The concept of rigorous proof is due to Alfred Tarski; according to it, mathematical proof is a sequence of sentences starting with axioms, each of which is a logical consequence of previous sentences. According to this ideal, rigorous proof breaks the real "train of thought" of the mathematician into small steps, each of which is authorized by the rules for deriving the formal system. But real mathematical practice completely avoids the realization of such an ideal, while implying that the ideal is true "in principle". Thus, in a real mathematical proof there are two hypostases: (1) a "substantive" proof that operates with concepts, definitions, informal verbal turns and (2) a "formal" proof, whose signs are devoid of any meaningful meaning. Both hypostases are connected by the concept of interpretation, giving intentional meaning to signs of formal evidence. One is intended to convey the thought, content of concepts, and the other is to observe the rigor of this transmission in order to prevent its distortion and, even more so, the loss of truth of statements. Formal proof in itself does not give understanding since the signs in the sequence of formulas do not matter for a logical conclusion. Of course, there is an implied or intentional interpretation of these signs, but it joins the signs from the outside; it joins the already existing formal system, which has a kind of autonomy. Therefore, it can be assumed that mathematical understanding is not based on the practice of mathematical derivation, but on some other aspect of mathematical practice. It is the fact that non-logical constants have many potential interpretations that requires maximum rigor from mathematical discourse. In addition, according to Gottlob Frege, mathematicians develop systems of written signs not to do without any content, but to express the content in such a way that rigorous reasoning can be built on the basis of this content. This means that the sources of semantics can be based on notational features. Thus, mathematical proof, although it is constructed as a strictly defined sequence of syntactic operations, implies the "entry" of semantic content into syntactic means, for example, in the case of notation and interpretation of non-logical constants.

DE journalist; periodicals; Alexander Adrianov; intellectual leader
AB The article analyzes the image of Alexander Adrianov as a journalist and intellectual leader in the memoirs of his contemporaries. Adrianov was a well-known journalist, editor of Sibirskaya gazeta and Sibirskaya zhizn' periodiclas, scientist, archaeologist, ethnographer. In the works devoted to Adrianov's personality, historians focused on his political, social, scientific activities; they also considered his cooperation with Siberian periodicals. The story of Adrianov as an intellectual leader of regional periodicals of the second half of the 19th - early 20th centuries still needs to be studied. The source basis of the article includes ego-documents of journalists, Adrianov's colleagues, significant "others" who directly interacted with him. In the study, the author focused on identifying Adrianov's characteristics in the context of leadership. For the journalist, the first priority was the presence of a literary talent. Having analyzed sources of a personal origin of colleagues about Adrianov, the author comes to the conclusion that his professional skills were evaluated differently. Yet Adrianov was able to climb the career ladder of a journalist: from the head of a department to the editor and publisher, which indicates his understanding of the newspaper business, literary talent, as well as the ability to organize collective work in publishing. The establishment of Sibirskiy vestnik, which became a competitor for Sibirskaya gazeta, left a special imprint on Adrianov's image. This circumstance affected Adrianov's perception by his colleagues, and also imposed some responsibility on him as an editor. Compliance with journalistic ethics by press actors testified to the recognition and acceptance of the "professional rules" of the community of the time. Adrianov took responsibility for the consequences of the publication of his own texts on the pages of Siberian periodicals of the second half of the 19th - early 20th centuries. As the editor of Sibirskaya gazeta, he acted as a link between employees and readers. Uniting his colleagues around him, he directed the work of the periodical in one direction. In relations with the authorities-governors, censors-Adrianov always defended the interests of the periodical. He has a straightforward personality, who, as a journalist and head of the local press, was able to preserve the periodical during the "hard times". Recognition of colleagues in the professional community played an important role for press actors. Adrianov was often invited to various anniversaries, memorable dates, which was a way of entering the journalistic world. The author comes to the conclusion that Adrianov was a moral and intellectual leader for journalists.

AB In November 1963, Aron Vergelis,editor of the Moscow Yiddish journal Sovetish Heymland (1961-1991), visited the United States for the first time. This was the first American voyage of a Soviet Jewish cultural personality since 1943, when Solomon Mikhoels and the Yiddish poet Itsik Fefer famously toured the United States as leaders of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee. As it turned out, this would be the beginning of Vergelis's quarter-century career as a globetrotting Cold War era propagandist. This article analyzes the circumstances by which Vergelis, a figure of modest influence and stature, appeared as a visible figure in the arena of Soviet-Western ideological confrontation.

AB The article discusses the changes that occurred in the wake of revolutionary events of October 25 (November 7), 1917 in Petrograd, which in many ways transformed the meaning and content of the theater. The goal of the revolution was to destroy not only the entire bourgeois system, but also the cultural heritage that had been created in Russia for centuries and above all, the religion. And since power of theater's impact on human psychology is well-known from the ancient times, it was determined to be one of the main tools in the fight against religiosity, especially of the Russian people. In that regard, one cannot pass over the fact that during a period of transformation of sociocultural processes of the 1920s and 1930s, theatrical activity turned out to be particularly effective in changing the consciousness of Russian society. The religious persecution was total, Soviet government having thought through every detail to sow discord within the church under the guise of fighting hunger, and thereby eradicating spirituality in people as soon as possible. Thus, under the conditions of building a new political system, for the first time in the entire centuries-long history, art came to be an object of politics, state-building belonging to the field of propaganda. The ideologists of Marxist-Leninist materialism, including A. V Lunacharsky, A. A. Bogdanov, as well as V I. Lenin, bore in mind a tremendous extent of theater' s influence on the audience, while considering primary matter, not spirit. To achieve their goals, they sought to use acting talent in the production of such anti-religious plays as "Savva" by Leonid Andreev, hence their close attention on it. Thus, gradually, steadily by means of theater among other things, proceeded the process of affecting the religiosity, as one of the characteristic features of the Russian society of the time. The process was not loyal, but ferocious due to the fact that within the shortest time the Soviet government needed to destroy spirituality in people replacing it with revolutionary expediency.

AB The collapse of the USSR and Czechoslovakia created preconditions for developing relations between Armenia and Czechia at the end of the 1990s - the beginning of the 2000s. Azerbaijan became the main partner of Czechia in the South Caucasus and Armenia found partly itself on the sidelines of a Caucasian policy of Prague. However, Armenia and Czechia have been recently getting interested in expanding cooperation. The main tendencies and controversies of the development of Armenian and Czech relations are analyzed in the article. This issue has not been properly explored in modern science literature. However this topic is of high practical importance as it expands our perceptions of realities of the current situation in the South Caucasus, a policy of the European Union in the region and the Armenian integration into the world economy and politics. The article concludes that Czechia has constructed a two-level system of a dialogue with Armenia. Prague closely connects "the Armenian course" of its own foreign policy with the policy of Eastern Partnership of the EU. The economic links of two states has not reached significant results mainly because of imperfection of the Armenian legal system, domestic political instability and serious problems in its economy. More achievements can be found in the development of a political dialogue between Prague and Yerevan. Czech Republic aspires to support the modernization of the Armenian economic, political and legal systems, the development of civil society institutions in the country.

TI Transformations of Traditional Culture: The Role of Rites of Passage
   among the Avatime People in the Modern Era
SO SOCIAL EVOLUTION & HISTORY
LA English
DT Article
AB The evolution of social institutions, particularly of rites of passage, is a gradual process in West Africa, drawing on a centuries-long body of tradition, and influenced by various cultural, economic and political factors. Today, gathering piece-by-piece the oral tradition of the history of the rites of passage of a small ethnic group in eastern Ghana, one can find many examples of how these practices are adaptive by their very nature (Baiburin 1993). The structure of the rite has been shaped by various external factors and historical process. The attempt to explain such rites by saying simply that 'the ancestors did it this way' is insufficient. Rather, a regularized socialization practice, in this case rites of passage, shares its functions with a number of other socialization practices, while it continues to evolve.

AB Issues are discussed related to Russia's political and economic objective to become one of the five major economies of the world. It is shown that the continuation of the existing trends in GDP should permit Russia to rise in the coming years from the sixth position to the fifth among the world nations in terms of GDP yet remain in this position only until the end of the 2020s. The authors believe that in the forecast period until 2024, an average annual growth rate of 3% in labor productivity is quite likely. This growth rate suggests better structural ratios for investment and productivity trends and a slightly higher rate of accumulation than at the beginning of the forecast period.

AB The article looks at the work of Old Russian literature of the late 16th - early 17th century, "The Tale of the Life of Tsar Theodore Ivanovich". This work was written by the first Russian patriarch Job. At first glance, the Life stands out among a number of works by Patriarch Job due to its apoliticality and lack of poignancy, and as so far as the time of its emerging did not correspond to the political moment of that time - the praise of the deceased tsar, and not his successor Boris Godunov. However, if we open the monument, we will find that the image of Boris Godunov in "The Tale" is not associated with Tsar Fyodor when reading, but rather with his father. Job considers Godunov to be doubly Terrible, who is twice as much as Father Fyodor Ivanovich in the indicated positive qualities, and indeed Fedor himself! At the same time, the characteristics of Boris encountered here are only a small part of the large-scale image of the last Rurikovich and his kingdom. The article answers the question: why did Patriarch Job bless Theodore so much and why didn't he use the chance for Godunov's real propaganda in The Tale, or did he use it?

AB The paper traces history of the Slovak theater since the Middle Ages, considering its development in terms of the evolution of theatrical art in the entire Central European region and in the context of European theater in general. For various socio-political and cultural reasons, up until 1920, only amateur theater companies existed in Slovakia, whose activities were largely restricted by the government of Austria-Hungary. Upon formation of the Czechoslovak Republic in 1920 the first professional theatre in Slovakia, the Slovak national theatre, is opening in Bratislava. The author focuses on the activities of the first leaders and directors, who shaped the artistic image and concept of the theater, and pays attention to the influence that various foreign directors and theater schools had on the former ones. The author emphasizes the role of Czech theatrical figures (B. Jetabek and the company of his East Bohemian Theatre, M. Zuna, O. Nedbal, V. Sulc, etc.) in building drama and opera troupes of the Slovak national theater as well as their influence on repertoire and artistic language of the latter. The very cosmopolitan cultural environment of Bratislava, together with the division of dramatic troupe of the theater into Slovak and Czech (1932) inducing dynamism, experimenting and competition among directors and artists who worked there. As a result, the Slovak theatre itself was gradually formed, and the first Slovak theatrical figures were brought up. Eventually, all this allowed young Slovak theater to join a broader context of the European avant-garde theater so that its unmistakably original voice was finally heard all over the world.

AB In recent decades, the interest of Russian society in historical science has grown immeasurably. The first reason for this increased interest is because in an era of global cataclysms people turn primarily to the past to find psychological support and thereby restore the connection of times. The second motivation is that, with the emergence of new states on the territory of the former Soviet Union, their political elites began looking through history for tools of their legitimation, often representing Russia as an occupant and an aggressor, ignoring the advantages gained by these peoples over the centuries of being in a single state. This report gives an answer to the question of how the professional community of historians in our country, relying on archival documents and scientific, reliable interpretation of the past is opposed to false theories and attempts to reconsider seemingly well-established historical facts.

AB The first part of the introduction gives an overview of the history and development of the anthropology of outer space internationally, including major events, key authors and topics, as well as current trends in this area of scholarly inquiry. The authors link research in the contemporary anthropology of outer space to the development of space technology after World War II, the competition of space superpowers and other states' attempts to catch up, as well as to the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Since the early twenty first century, the field has been interested in the so-called New Space movement represented by grassroots entrepreneurs that seek to explore outer space economically, politically and culturally, beyond the framework of state-funded programmes and affiliated space corporations. The second part of the introduction presents the Special Theme Section articles, their underlying studies, methodological approaches and research results. The concluding part shows how the anthropology of outer space is associated with a number of important current trends in anthropology.

The study is based on the theoretical material from a number of researchers (P.V. Zhesterov, A.P. Kuznetsov, E.V. Kunts, R.A. Romashov, V.P. Salnikov, and others). The Constitution of the Russian Federation and the laws of the country were also used. The methodological basis of the study is dialectic, comparative legal and formal legal methods. In particular, the use of the dialectical method contributed to the study of law enforcement problems at different stages of the development of legislation in the field of the constitutional foundations of the criminal policy of Russia, the pre-revolutionary, Soviet, and modern periods of its development. The use of comparative legal and formal legal methods helped to identify approaches to the conduct of criminal policy in the countries participating in the United Nations, and the prospects for using various criminal policy measures to develop the constitutional system of Russia. As a result, the authors came to the conclusion that Russian policy at all stages of its formation was based on the delimitation and isolation of government bodies and officials from society as a whole and its individual representatives in particular. In the political practice of Russia, the people at all historical stages were not subjects of political power but, rather, objects of public administration, whose vital activity was always determined by a "higher will". Unconscious resistance to this will in a number of cases resulted in "blind and merciless Russian riots", representing the so-called "conflicts of hopelessness", inherently doomed and destructive in essence. A feature of the criminal policy of the state, as applied to modern Russia, is its "focus" on the personality of the head of state-the president, who owns both the prerogatives in the field of legislative, organizational, and personnel support of anti-criminal activity and the "final word" in the field of criminal prosecution and justice. In relation to criminal policy at the international level, Russia acts as one of the member states, which in the formal sense does not differ from other UN member states, but in reality claims to have the same central place in international politics that the USSR had before.

AB Today, half a century after its inception, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) faces a plethora of old and new challenges: first, the NTP states parties are now starting to walk away from their obligations under the Treaty; second, the Treaty's articles are receiving multiple interpretations, which creates dangerous discrepancies; and, finally, non-proliferation regimes and norms are being undermined by military conflicts and political tensions. Divisions among the states parties over the way forward on disarmament, non-proliferation and peaceful uses of nuclear energy continue to grow amid the current tense international environment. Diplomacy, negotiations and dialogue take second place to platitudinous postulations and constant bickering. There is no consensus among the NPT states parties concerning the pathway for substantive nuclear disarmament. Nuclear weapons and ballistic missile program of the DPRK continues to pose both regional and global proliferation threat. The future of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and Iran's nuclear program is hanging in the air. At issue is the failure to make any tangible progress towards establishing a zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East, which effectively became the main "apple of discord" during the previous review conference. There are strong chances that next year it will again become a highly contentious issue and lead the 2020 NPT Review Conference to the same fate that befall its predecessor. There is growing anxiety about the outcome of this crucial event. These challenges are as daunting as they are urgent and require immediate and concerted response from all the states parties to the NPT. Given the currently challenging international environment and the crisis in arms control regime, if two consecutive review conferences - one of which also marks the Treaty's half century anniversary - fail to agree on an outcome document, it could have grave consequences for the NPT and the entire nuclear non-proliferation regime.

DE Life support system in ethnocultures; Vyatka; Russian regions;
   industrial and post-industrial transformations of ethnic groups
AB Combinatorics of industrial and post-industrial processes are manifested differently in different countries and regions of the world. Ethnographic / anthropological research reveals their focus, speed, territorial specificity. The purpose of the work is the study of life support systems, the reproduction of ethnic cultures, which is relevant today due to problems with natural resources, environmental pollution, increased stress in everyday life, a decrease in the ecology of life, immunity, etc. The methodology is based on the methods of ethnographic expeditions, ethnomonitoring in specific Russian territory (the Vyatka province in the past, the Kirov region - now). For several decades, patterns have been identified and formulas for consolidating industrial and post-industrial changes in the 20th - early 21st centuries have been presented. Results. There is a change in the types of settlements, from the location and size in the cultural landscape. The structure of the settlement was changing, new, industrial facilities - new socio-political institutions, complicated production - were "implanted" in them. Ethnoeconomics, along with industrial elements, continued to maintain traditional, peasant household occupations, which served as an aid in crises. Cultural inversions were also observed in the use of clothing, utensils, and the food system. The mainstay of the life support system was health conservation. It included a balance of physical labor and rest, disease prevention, herbal medicine, maintaining immunity and stress prevention. The spiritual abandonment of ethnic cultures during the Soviet time has undergone a maximum of changes. Religious holidays were forbidden, part of the Orthodox and Muslim rites was reproduced secretly, ethnopedagogy was partially preserved only at home. New communication expanded in communities, names, communication style and relationships. Ethnomonitoring in such Russian regions as the Kirov region demonstrates the non-linearity of the change of the agrarian to the industrial and post-industrial era, and their parallel coexistence in crises shows cultural inversions. Such adjustments to common theories can increase efficiency in managing the economy and socio-political life of these complex territories.

AB The relevance of the study is determined by the fact that the one-many problems in the ancient and Christian culture of religious and philosophical thought reveal individual facets of the ontology of the world and man, the reasons for their existence and potential opportunities. Studied in the context of religious and philosophical discourse, the one-many problems contribute to a more in-depth ontological analysis of the causes of public and social conflicts, violence, terrorism, sectarianism since they draw our attention to the violation of the unity in spiritual and cultural traditions. If not to reduce this violation only to manifestations of church and law historical reality and signs qualifying various aspects of dissent, one can see that it is a deep and multifaceted phenomenon of the spiritual and moral life of a person that has a direct impact on culture and society. The violation of the unity of spiritual and cultural-historical traditions often becomes a destructive form of extremist apostasy from all goodness, love, humanity as a whole, that is, it acquires a certain global significance. The article discusses the sources of the ancient and early Christian religious and philosophical traditions which reveal the problem indicated in the title of the article. They are compared with the early Christian cultural and historical tradition. The general direction of ancient and early Christian religious and philosophical thought is revealed, mainly oriented to the "eternal questions" of being: comprehension of the universal problems of the fate of the world and man, salvation and death, life and death, good and evil. The author also reveals the differences in the approaches of ancient and early Christian philosophers to the above topics. The article shows the importance and relevance of the ontological problems of unity of values for a deeper contemporary philosophical discourse on preventing interreligious, public and social conflicts, violence, destructive sectarianism, extremism and terrorism.

DE Eurasianism; Church; Russia; state; Russian Empire; Orthodoxy; Europe;
   Eurasia; international relations
AB The author analyzes the ideological views of a group of Russian migrants of the first wave, known as Eurasianists, including N.S. Trubetskoy, P.N. Savitsky, N.N. Alekseeva, L.N. Karsavina and others. The author discusses fundamental elements of the classical Eurasianist program, such as the role of the Orthodox Church and the state in the life of Russia and its society, their attitude to Roman Catholic culture, and their place in dialogue with other religions. In addition, other important elements of Eurasianism noted here are the ideas of pan-Eurasian nationalism, ideocracy, the spatial borders of Russia-Eurasia, the symphonic personality, a guarantee state. These issues are associated directly with the authors of these concepts and with Eurasianism in general. The author demonstrates the continuity with the teachings of the Slavophiles and highlights the special attention that the Eurasians paid to the traditional cultures of Russia. Also noted is the interest in Eurasianism of church circles in exile in Europe. At the same time, the Eurasianists' critical vies on the "Petersburg period" in the history of the Russian church are highlighted, which are also implicit in Eurasianism as an independent ideological and philosophical line of thought of Russian emigration in the first half of the twentieth century. An attempt is made to show how, through conservative thought, Eurasians tried to form a new type of political identity. This ideological direction with an emphasis on spirituality and special institutions was considered by Eurasians as a prototype of the future statehood of Russia as opposed to the Soviet-Marxist system. In the context of the contemporary Eurasian integration (EAEU), of the current role of the Russian Orthodox Church and external political manipulations around the role of the Moscow Patriarchate, the theoretical views of the Eurasians take on a new dimension.

DE poetry; pure language; living metaphor; Martin Heidegger; Hans-Georg
   Gadamer; Paul Ricoeur
AB The philosophy of language has become one of the key areas of modern philosophical research beginning with the linguistic turn of the 20th century. This fact has specified the thoroughness in considering the place of language in the world and its relationship with being. Heidegger laid the foundation for the ideas of language as a guarantor of human being-in-the-world in modern philosophy. According to him, it is pure language in the form of poetry that allows man to lift the veil of being and, through the language, enter into the "house of being". Despite the social functions of language, Heidegger excludes the perception of language as a communicative tool and denies the utilitarian approach to it. This position becomes more clearly seen after the "poetic turn" in Heidegger's philosophizing, when he brings the "narrative" as a practical pronunciation of language to a fundamentally new level: pure language. The "purity" of poetry as an original language does not depend on the personal qualities of the poet; it is the ability of the language to call things into being and ensure their presence in the world that determines its purity. Heidegger's disciple Gadamer reinterprets ideas about poetic language and transforms them into a new notion: pure poetry. Gadamer denies the qualitative differentiation of linguistic levels, but he recognizes the obvious difference between everyday and poetic languages. The philosopher places a special emphasis on the self-worth of the poetic word that possesses a symbolized significance unlike the word of everyday language. The highest form of poetry, according to Gadamer, is a lyric poem. This form of language, because of its closeness, is able to preserve the semantic unity of the poetic text and ensure the invariance of the value of the poetic word. Ricoeur's notion of a living metaphor and its relationship with poetic discourse is in line with Gadamer's ideas. According to Ricoeur, the metaphor remains living until it goes beyond the literal reading of the text. An important role in the creation of metaphors in poetic discourse belongs to a productive imagination. Ricoeur emphasizes that the basis of poetic discourse is interaction between the metaphorical way of an utterance and the violation of commonly used meanings of words.

DE France; higher education; universities cluster; attractiveness
   enhancement
AB This article details the stages of clustering of the French higher education system in order to increase the visibility of French universities and their attractiveness among international students, which led to profound structural changes: if after 1970 the number of universities was artificially increased by dividing larger universities into smaller ones, in 2006 and then in 2013 the reverse process was carried out, the universities were merged and "Poles" and "communities" uniting universities, higher schools, research laboratories and other institutions were created. On the first stage, research units were merged into "Thematic Networks for Advanced Research" (RTR, Reseaux thematiques de recherche avancee) and universities founded "Research and Formation Clusters" (PRES, Poles de recherche et d'enseignement superieur). By 2012 27 clusters were created, some of them received special financial support from the French government through the IDEX excellence program. In 2013 PRES had to become "Communities of Universities and Institutions" (COMUE, communaute d'universites et etablissements), a different form of cluster, which can be taken into account as a higher educational institution (HEI) by international ranking agencies. In this article, using the example of Montpellier and Bordeaux, the authors retrace the difficulties of the union process. In Montpellier and Bordeaux, a unique university could not be afforded (University of Montpellier + Montpellier-3 University, University of Bordeaux + Bordeaux Montaigne University). In Paris, by 2006, when the process of clusterisation began, there where 17 universities and 143 engineering schools. For the moment one can determine about 10 clusters, representing form 2 to about 15 HEIs each. The process is not finished, and every year one can hear about the splitting of a cluster or the merging of two universities. The article tells further the history of the Sorbonne, the most well-known French university. On the one hand, it is by now only a building in which different HEI hold their lectures. On the other hand, different HEIs put the word "Sorbonne" in their name even if they are not located in this very building in the Latin Quarter in Paris. The authors warn international partners of French universities about the signification of some Parisian universities. "Paris University" (Universite de Paris) is only "one of the universities in Paris" and "Sorbonne University" (Sorbonne Universite) is not the only university in Paris having a link with the Sorbonne (one should not forget about Universite Sorbonne Paris-Cite). In conclusion, one can hardly say that French universities have become more visible on the international market, which was the main objective of this campaign.

AB The article discusses the processes of constitution of unknown knowledge. The authors suggest that the image of the future (its cognitive pattern) is one of the possible options manifesting in one form or another (for example, as an element of a pattern) in the actual reality of the subject of knowledge. In addition, the research presents an analysis of various epistemological approaches to the problem of the formation of patterns of unknown knowledge in the context of the semiosis of a sociocultural phenomenon. In this article, the research focuses on the process (and its possible grounds) of creating / constituting new knowledge in the context of the transformation of the dynamical object (Charles Pierce). The current hypothesis of this study is that new knowledge, along with the process of its constitution, is not only largely predetermined by previous knowledge and existing cognitive patterns, but, in the context of the "open universe" thesis (Ilya Prigogine), it is possible to assume that this kind of constitutions, as well as the possibility of new interpretations of previous (long-known) knowledge, are infinite. The aim of this research is to identify elements (percipienda-an element that should be perceived) that can be used in patterns that describe the future and extrapolate our current ideas/patterns of the image of future taking into account possible inaccuracies / errors, etc., revealed in the course of time (the problem of falsification of knowledge). Knowledge as one of the sociocultural phenomena and one of the types of social practices has a number of features that give it the opportunity to create rational schemes. The interpretation of the bases of such schemes depends on our interpretation of the problems associated with percipienda. The following methods are used in the research: semiotic analysis and epistemological explication.

AB The "Polish-Polish War" metaphor describing relations between two major political parties - the "Civic Platform" and "Law and Justice" - has become a regular item in Polish political discourse. The article starts with explaining the origins of this conflict. The authors compare political programs of the two parties and highlight the key stages of the "war", describing it in detail, focusing on events and factors that contributed to its escalation. The final section explores the effects of the conflict for the political system. Reviewing the background of the "Polish-Polish War" the authors point out that initially, in the late 1980s, major political actors in Poland - the Polish Communist Party and the Trade Union "Solidarity" - reached an agreement which contained core elements for consensus to be developed on the future soft political transition. However, the parliamentary elections of 1993 were won by left-wing parties due to the ongoing fragmentation of the groups derived from the "Solidarity", as well as transition difficulties that accompanied Poland during radical economic reforms. The early 2000s created a new balance of power in the party system stemming from the disappearance of left-wing parties which had lost electoral support. The two right-wing parties lead by former political companions in the resistance for many years - Kaczynsky brothers and Donald Tusk became major political rivals. Exploring the development of the "Polish-Polish War" the authors demonstrate how an abusive political rhetoric and aggressive political actions determined the political discourse and changed the sociopolitical atmosphere in Poland later on. More significantly, the mutual aversion continued even when the pally leaders had changed, and it is reproduced in public speeches of the new leadership at present. It is concluded that the "Polish-Polish War" had a number of negative effects on the political system. Among them there are: a growing lack of public confidence in political institutions; constraining political development due to the lack of political actors with new ideas and values on the left side of the ideological spectrum, who could potentially re-evaluate the political confrontation, set aside old divisions and supply new socio-political agenda.

DE post-truth; knowledge; game; truth; power; Steve Fuller
AB Post-truth is a special negative characteristic of information, its production, transmission and reception. The remarkable feature of Steve Fuller's book Post-Truth: Knowledge as a Power Game is that it attempts to formulate the socio-epistemological concept of post-truth within the framework of the academic trend. In this way, Fuller explains where the negative assessments of the post-truth phenomenon in the public sphere come from and shows where they lead science and society. The authors chose Chapter 2 for translation, because in it the author reveals the essence of the concept of post-truth, while the remaining chapters are devoted to the second question: where post-truth leads us. In Chapter 2, Fuller acts as a philosopher who expounds on his position. Fuller as a sociologist of science and a philosopher is a fashionable, popular, deep and shocking thinker. His vivid and argumentative speeches in support of the creationist concept of "Intelligent Design", transhumanism and many other disputable ideas earned him the fame of a rebel thinker. In this role, he appears in the remaining chapters of his book-as a "crushing trust", in his own words. Fuller overthrows traditions not only in science and philosophy, to which scientists, in general, are accustomed, but also in public life, including politics, where those political movements that are today stigmatized as populist, for example, Brexit, are in fact manifestations of post-truth. Fuller argues that post-truth is the reality of our life, whether we like it or not, it is a kind of democracy of knowledge of the post-information era, when the majority who receive power and with it the ability to set rules for others may not be scientists at all, not those who impersonate them and not even professionals in their field. Post-truth has negative correlations because it is a game with very high stakes. This is a game of knowledge, in which the reward is truth, and the goal is modal power, which true knowledge gives, provided that other players recognize the winner of the prize as the best user of true knowledge. The winner receives special power over the minds, if not the souls, of others, and this provokes the desire of the parties to wrap themselves in favor of the rule, the field of the game or its course, i.e., maximize the benefits of post-truth. This is where negative assessments are rooted, according to Fuller. In his book, he explicitly talks about two ways to play. One way is to directly play this game with other people, like sophists, and the second is to formulate the rules of the game for others, like Plato or other philosophers. Fuller describes both methods in detail and shows great players from different teams. Among them are Thomas Aquinas and Ignatius Loyola, Isaac Newton and Stephen Hawking, poets, playwrights, Hollywood directors, pop singers and editors of leading scientific journals.

AB The role of logic and logical culture in philosophical knowledge and, accordingly, in modern philosophical education is considered. It is proved that the role of logic is essential and often a key one, firstly, as a propaedeutics of any philosophical knowledge forming the necessary logical culture for philosophical knowledge; secondly, as a methodological basis for philosophical research and interpretation of philosophical texts; thirdly, as an important, and sometimes main, part of the content of basic philosophies; finally, logical theories provide us with an effective apparatus for an adequate analysis of the philosophical argumentation and semantic structure of a particular philosophical text. Based on specific examples, for instance, inadequate interpretations of the critical philosophy of Kant, the theory of descriptions of Russell, etc., the author demonstrates how a misunderstanding of logic and logical concepts that underlie the philosophical system leads to its incorrect interpretations. Unfortunately, the key importance of logic and disciplines of the logical cycle in philosophical knowledge and education has not been satisfactorily realized in the structures involved in the organization of modern Russian education.

TI THE ORIGINS OF AN ANALYTICAL APPROACH TO THE PROBLEMS OF TECHNOLOGY:

DE techne; technology; episteme; knowledge; Aristotle; theoretical reason;
   practical reason
AB The article is devoted to an attempt to demonstrate that the epistemological orientation of the analytical philosophy of technology is determined not only by the internal logic of analytic philosophy and the specifics of its tools, but also by the nature of the subject. In other words, the epistemological element was laid down in the ancient Greek concept 'techne' (eta tau epsilon chi nu eta - art, handicraft, craft, ability), which made it possible to form an appropriate approach to technology and engineering within analytic philosophy. First, the author briefly considers Plato's dialogue "Ion", in which techne and episteme are explicitly linked and contrasted with divine inspiration. Further, the author shows that, in general, Aristotle, in contrast to Plato, was inclined to draw a clear line between techne and episteme. According to Aristotle, episteme and techne differ in the scope (the former deals with constant being, the latter with changeable one), the degree of accuracy (the former is more accurate than the latter), the goal (the goal of the formmer is truth, the goal of the latter is usefulness), and the degree of universality (episteme is more universal than techne). However, despite the fact that knowledge refers to the theoretical mind, and art to the poetic (or practical) mind, there are points at which they cross. This is well illustrated by the example of the medical craft. According to Aristotle, "health is the definition (omicron lambda omicron gamma omicron sigma) and cognition (eta epsilon pi iota sigma tau eta) in the physician's soul." Therefore, the healing process consists of two stages: at the first stage, the doctor reflects on the causes of the disease and methods of treatment; at the second, he concludes on what "he is able to do" (alpha upsilon tau omicron sigma delta upsilon nu alpha tau alpha iota pi omicron iota epsilon iota nu). This transition from reflecting to acting is the boundary between the epistemic and practical levels, since at the level of episteme, as mentioned earlier, one is dealing with constant being, and at the level of techne with changeable one. Thus, in art, one can distinguish two levels, which can be referred to as "epistemological" and "practical". At the same time, one should speak about the epistemological component only to a certain extent because a sufficient degree of accuracy and necessity of episteme is not achieved in this case.

DE sociology of medicine; digital technologies; dehumanization
AB Digitalization of health care and medicine transforms the usual organizational ties "doctorpatient", significantly alters the way of providing medical services and the way of personal contact, which is less and less significant, while preserving the social role of the doctor. Social changes resulting from the digitalization of health care, which sociology studies, are also associated with the transformation of the structure of the labor market of medical workers and the emergence of new professions of medicine of the future at the intersection of sciences. New opportunities are being created for the working population. Sociology also studies the social prospects of healthcare digitalization. These prospects are associated with the formation of the information society and the digital economy, the creation of technologies and services in medicine, quite competitive in the global and domestic market. The international expert community conducted sociological and socioeconomic research and noted a new direction: "investment in social impact". This confirms that the digitalization of medicine and the economy gave rise to the ideology of impact investing. That is, the digitalization of health care and the economy has led to the need to form a new civilizational paradigm, to the need for a human measurement of technological and economic processes. Positive social changes resulting from the development of digital medicine do not exclude the emergence of social risks (e.g., possible violation of privacy, patients' rights, lower level of security and dangerous dehumanization of society, lower value of the patient as a person) in the development of biomedicine and genetic engineering as areas of digital medicine. Information technology, digital medicine help to create a better organizational model of health care. Digital medicine as an activity implies that data in digital form, processing of large volumes and the use of analysis results can improve the effectiveness of medical technologies, especially at the stage of diagnosis, counseling and prevention. However, the immediate and final stage of treatment of the patient (for example, in surgery) still assumes the priority of human, not artificial, intelligence. This consideration is valid not only in relation to medicine, but also to many other manifestations of social activity of people living, as sociology teaches, in society and carrying out their social relations in their statuses and roles.

DE free act; natural kind term; compatibilism; incompatibilism
ID ROBOT CATS
AB The article is an attempt to answer the question of whether a 'free act' is a natural kind term. The answer to this question is of theoretical interest. An affirmative answer to the question leads to the conclusion: a free act can be investigated only empirically. The first part of the article reviews various approaches to the understanding of the concepts of natural kind terms, namely: essentialism, unificationism and promiscuous realism. The second part presents the main views on what a 'free act' is according to different positions in the contemporary analytic philosophy of mind: compatibilism (free will is compatible with determinism), libertarianism (there is free will and the world is not determined) and hard incompatibilism (free will is compatible with neither determinism nor indeterminism). It turns out that in hard incompatibilism, free acts could not form a natural kind. However, there is such an opportunity in compatibilism and libertarianism. For example, we can use the arguments by Antony Flew and by Michal Heller. Both arguments are applicable to compatibilism and libertarianism. In the final part of the article, objections from Peter van Invagen and the argument by Russell Daw and Torin Alter are considered. Van Inwagen argues that Flew's position leads to absurd. There is a possible world in which Martians put a tiny device in people's brains and control all their actions. But this world is identical to the real one if we agree with Flew. Daw and Alter provide a strong objection to Heller. If we find out that 'free acts' are defined by some essence or cluster of properties, then there possibly are organisms that lack this essence or these properties but act freely. Therefore, essentialism and unificationism could not define a 'free act' as a natural kind term. The last approach of promiscuous realism has the problem of finding the difference between natural and non-natural kinds. So, it is not the best way to argue that a 'free act' is a natural kind term. Thus, the conclusion of the article that a 'free act' is not a natural kind term.

DE neurophenomenology; consciousness; biogenetic structuralism;
   neuroscience; cognitive environment
AB The article deals with the problem of cognition in the framework of the biogenetic structuralist neurophenomenology of Charles Laughlin. The aim of the article is to study the possibilities of applying the biogenetic structuralist theory as a theoretical and methodological basis for the study of consciousness in Laughlin's theory. A feature of biogenetic structuralism is the interdisciplinary fusion of anthropology, psychology, and neuroscience. The methodology of biogenetic structuralism allows exploring universal structures of consciousness, which are caused by the genetically predisposed organization of the human nervous system. Universal structures of consciousness include structures that mediate human language, knowledge of time and space. It is shown that the problem of cognition is realized in neurognostic models, which are compared with the operational environment. Neurognostic models include both the real nature of man as an organism and the external environment of the organism. Laughlin introduces the concept of a cognitive environment to designate a set of neurognostic models that can potentially be captured by the area of consciousness. He relies on the idea of a cognitive environment, which is essentially intentional in its organization. The polar interaction between the prefrontal cortex and the sensory cortex of the human brain gives rise to the intentionality of consciousness. Laughlin explains the work of the human cerebral cortex neurognostically as omnipresent for human consciousness, and independent of the cultural background. The cerebral cortex is a field of neural activity that arises and dissolves in temporal sequences and coordinates with cognitive processes that connect meaning and form into a single structure in consciousness. The experience of consciousness suggests a sensitive sphere of the cerebral cortex ascertains the meaningful, phenomenal world. The biogenetic structuralist methodology allows to develop an idea of the intentional structure and uniqueness of consciousness. The biogenetic structuralist approach is heuristic for modern science because, firstly, this approach creates the maximum opportunity to include data obtained from naturalistic, ethnographic, anatomical, clinical, and experimental sources; secondly, biogenetic data have the widest empirical and phenomenological rationale; thirdly, biogenetic concepts are defined in the context of a holistic understanding of the phenomenon through the uniqueness of consciousness.

AB This paper presents the results of research into the linguistic personality of politician Sergey Mikheyev when viewed as a discourse personality. Special consideration has been given to the speech behaviour characteristic of a discourse personality. The paper presents the results of the cognitive-discursive and linguor-hetorical description of a discourse personality. The relevance of this research is based on the growing interest for linguistic personality typology with regards to discourse (K. F. Sedov, V. I. Karasik, N. D. Golev, A. V. Bolotnov, et al.). A mixed type of political discourse that actualises both the personal and status factors of its formation was chosen as the object of analysis. The research focuses on semantic dominants and semantic constructs of the discourse behaviour of the Russian politician Sergey Mikheyev, as well as on the cognitive and linguo-rhetorical mechanisms of the interpretation of speech acts when viewed as elements of individual discourse behaviour. We define the linguo-rhetorical competence of the politician's personality. The study is novel in that it identifies semantic dominants and semantic constructs found in Mikheyev's discourse and uses an integrative approach to analysis (cognitive-discursive and linguo-rhetorical). It is proven that semantic dominants, constructs, and presuppositions manifest inventive mechanisms of individual discourse activity. We suggest defining the status of Mikheyev's discourse personality as a mixed type of elitist linguistic personality that is pragmatically oriented. We prove that the discourse personality of Sergey Mikheyev is a prototype of a future successful politician's linguistic personality. The paper presents the author's original communicative competence system of S. Mikheyev's discourse personality.

DE Gilberto De Mello Freyre; Brazil; inequality; poverty; urbanization;
   multiculturalism
AB The article discusses the life and work of Gilberto De Mello Freyre, one of the well-known thinkers at the origins of the national sociological school of Brazil. His scientific heritage is so diverse that even today it raises interest among researchers. A descendant of Portuguese colonialists, Freyre was able to understand the originality and uniqueness of Brazil, its history and culture, and showed this to the world in his many works. The most famous one is his earliest work Casa-Grande. Senzala ("Manors and Barracks"), first published in 1933. It is an original case study that focuses on the details of the life of the Brazilian population of the 17th-18th centuries. The author describes it relying on various methods of data acquisition. The work can be considered the first sociological study presenting a detailed analysis of the social life of Brazil. Considering the features of the life of the local population, the author describes them, demonstrates their interconnectedness and dependence on the environment and cultural traditions. The subordination of all elements gives an understanding of the systemic nature of this world, which Freyre knew well and analyzed brilliantly. Considering the peculiarities of the relationship between different cultures, he notes the need to establish the equality of their bearers through the preservation of traditions and lifestyles, the change of which should occur gradually, but not by force, taking into account all factors: natural, social, cultural ones. Despite the almost century-long period after the first edition, this book is still relevant for understanding modern Brazil. Another famous book by Freyre that is interesting when considering his contribution to the development of sociology in Brazil is called Sociology: An Introduction to Its Principles. Freyre defines sociology as a science about socialization, which he understands as the formation of a social person as a result of the mutual conditioning of biological, psychological, geographical, historical, and cultural factors. Despite the fact that Freyre's methods and works are subject to criticism, many issues he discussed are still relevant. Therefore, studies of his works can help to get a fresh look at the "eternal" social problems that are familiar to all societies: inequality, poverty, exclusion, etc.

   JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY SOCIOLOGY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE

DT Article
DE Rudolf Bultmann; man; personality; existence; essence of man
AB The article analyzes the concept of personality in the works of Rudolf Bultmann. Sources for the development of the theory of personality for Bultmann are the Judeo-Christian sacred texts, the legacy of the Protestant Reformation and the existential philosophy of the 20th century. Bultmann's concept of personality is closely connected with his general hermeneutical program, which aims to actualize the Christian proclamation in modern conditions. According to Bultmann, an analysis of the concept "existence" is also an analysis of the essence of Dasein so that an examination of existence can also be an examination of the essence of man. The principle of relationship constitutes the being of Dasein, reaching the very essence of human existence and wholly defining it. Being in relationship, understood as the being of Dasein, is not some kind of a general principle of everything, but it is precisely the concrete being of Dasein. Prior to any free decision and position of a particular person, human being, as a concrete human being, according to Bultmann, is "being-in", "being-with and for", "being-of", and "being-to-self". Human existence is not something that a person can observe from outside, but they themselves. Although no man can act differently from their being, this being never stands directly behind their actions and is not their unchanging foundation. Man's behavior and actions constitute human being. The concept "essence" does not describe the inherent properties of man, because, following Bultmann, the essence of man is not something static and amenable to an unambiguous interpretation. Bultmann asserts that the essence of man is their will. Will is not about arbitrary voluntarism since Bultmann only notes the dialectical structure of the relationship between being and human action. Will, as an intention, never exists without reason, and desires and plans are impossible without knowledge and understanding. But if the driving force of life is decisions, then will must be designated as its determining factor. Man always lives from what they are a result of and always goes to what they live for. Understanding of personality, in contrast to the idealistic idea of the formation of an ideal person, emphasizes the paradoxical-dialectical nature of human existence in the absence of its unchanging foundation. The existence of human being is determined by the extent to which a person took their being upon themselves and, being a temporal and historical creature, transmitted it to the future through their decisions. Therefore, being is never given, but is always a project of the future.

AB The article proposes a clarification of the role of ideas and revolutionary ideologies within the framework of modern revolutionary process theories focused on the state. These approaches, created within the framework of sociology and political science, emphasize the "objectivity" of a revolution, in contrast to the classical historical approaches with their emphasis on the role of revolutionary ideas and ideologies in explaining the logic of revolutionary processes. The article proposes a combination of historical and sociopolitical approaches to analyzing the role of ideas in revolutionary processes based on the understanding of the state as a dialectic of strategic rationality and communicative rationality (Jurgen Habermas). The author demonstrates the key role of ideas for explaining various results of revolutions in the form of ideologies of a new revolutionary state in the context of analysis of some theoretical comparative studies of the revolutionary processes (Michael Mann and Misagh Parsa).

DT Article
DE risk; risk-reflection; socio-political order; governmentality;
   knowledge; discourse; manipulation
AB The article discusses the issues of risk and risk-reflection in modern societies. It also illustrates the role of the relationship of knowledge and power in the formation of ideas about risks and the importance of risk reflection in maintaining order. A modern society is viewed as a world formed on the basis of reflections and decisions. Risk reflections in risk management, understanding a situation and determining costs and benefits, are based on comprehensive knowledge provided by experts, professionals, authorities and, finally, the authorities. The configuration for exercising power is regulated by the configuration of knowledge or discourse, which controls the direction of information and the language that support and disseminate ideas that orient actors' actions. Discourse determines awareness and an understanding of the risks that actors may face. The article notes that the problems are based on monopolization of the right to determine what is considered a risk as well as what is its scope and possibilities of implementation. In this regard, the discurse on risk for beneficiaries is the basis for public administration, as knowledge of risks and their negative consequences becomes a motive for responsible behavior, in which individuals otherwise interpret, control, and direct their behavior. The article concludes that by considering risks in a controlled order, the authorities legitimize them. Risks are viewed as a representation of reality and this allows for the ability to manage the risk's impact. The regulatory function of power manifests itself indirectly, forming and transmitting knowledge and ideas. The purpose of power is a modification of behavior when an individual, acting independently, contributes to the achievement of the goals facing the power.

AB The article is devoted to the process of displaying a changing historical discourse in a museum exposition. As an example, the author takes the case of the exposition building at the State Museum of Ethnography in 1930s - 1950s. Sources for research were archival materials of the Russian Ethnographic Museum. In the 1930s - 1950s. one of the most important policy areas of the USSR was to strengthen and develop its influence in the Slavic states. The territories of Western Ukraine and Western Belarus, which were part of Poland, entered the USSR in 1939. The State Museum of Ethnography, as a museum reflecting the national policy of the country, reacted to these events instantly: already in the autumn of 1939 an exhibition was being built that was supposed to form a correct perception of events for visitors. The process of accession was submitted through the prism of saving the fraternal people from enemy Poland. After the Second World War, the political mood, and with them, and science, and museums - are changing. So, the ideas of the Slavic brotherhood and the leading role of the Russian people in it become relevant. SME is building a series of exhibitions devoted to the folk art of the Slays already in 1945. And in 1953, the 300th anniversary of the reunification of Ukraine and Russia was celebrated in the USSR, and a large, diverse exhibition at the SME would also be held. The author seeks to show how, in a changing political discourse, scientific discourse changed, and with it the museum space, how it was possible to form completely different political statements using the same museum objects.

AB To achieve the goals of the policy of sinicization of religions, the authorities of China are reviewing existing and adopting new legal acts regulating the activities of religious organizations. The most significant recent event in this regard has been the adoption of a new version of the Regulation on Religious Affairs, which came into effect in February 2018. At present, it is the main document regulating the religious sphere in China. The development of the new Regulation was aimed at strengthening preventive control in relation to religious communities. A number of other important documents were adopted reflecting the main trends of the PRC's modern religious policy - strengthening the party's leadership, increasing the role of patriotic religious associations, strengthening control over communities at the grassroots level, ideological education of clergy, combating unregistered communities, restraint the spread of religious ideas in society, and regulation of publications on religions in the Chinese segment of the Internet.
   Chinese authorities regard religions as a potential ideological threat. They associate the religious factor with a threat to national security, propaganda of religious extremism, provocations of internal political conflicts, and terrorist activities. We can talk about the attempt of the authorities of the PRC to drive religions into a certain ghetto, to designate a framework for their activities and establish unified rules for their functioning, so as to ensure the ideological security of religions and reduce their impact on society.

AB Introduction. In recent decades, the issue of security has remained very acute and most pressing in modern international relations. Security is the key word that defines domestic and foreign policies of states in both the Caucasus region and a number of European regions. In the late 80s of the 20th century, the collapse of the Soviet Union was painful, accompanied by the economic collapse, the rupture of socio-economic and political ties, awakening of national identity, which often took the form of nationalistic character. Painful processes took place in Eastern and Southeastern Europe, in the Caucasus, which flamed with conflicts. Owing to ethno political conflicts new state formations appeared. Methods and materials. This article uses a set of methods for studying international politics, mainly the comparative, systemic, structural and functional ones, as well as methods for analyzing and processing documents, including content analysis. The use of the conflictological paradigm is the main methodological tool of this study. The authors also use the case study method for studying various conflicts (Georgian-Ossetian conflict, in Cyprus, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in Transdniestria, etc.). The article analyzes the UN Resolutions, treaties, and memorandums relating to the non-use of force in the Georgian-Ossetian conflict and conflicts in Europe. Analysis. One of the key aspects of regional security in the system of international relations is the issue of signing the Treaty on the Non-Use of Force. This issue has also been discussed at the official site - the Geneva meetings. The South Caucasus is an unstable, conflict-prone region with many problems. Here interests of both world and regional players collide, which cannot influence stability and security in regional international relations positively. Moreover, new c, challenges are swaying the situation, in particular, in the form of world terrorism and wars in the neighboring Middle East. Each of the countries located in the South Caucasus is fully aware of the need for stable peace and security in the region, but, at the same time, they do not have a common opinion on the issues relating to the mechanisms for achieving this state. As regards, in particular, the Georgian-Ossetian relations, the situation is aggravated by the foreign policy of these countries - while Georgia is taking steps towards European integration and joining NATO, South Ossetia is more and more integrated into the socio-economic and political legal components of the Russian ct Federation, denoting its strategic partnership with Russia as a guarantee of its own security. Results. The examples of conflicts in Europe and the Georgian-Ossetian conflict analyzed in the article show that the Agreements on the non use of force could serve as a basis for the cease-fire, divorce of the warring parties and the beginning of preparing a platform for the negotiation process. Nevertheless, there is not unequivocal answer to the question of whether such agreements are a guarantee that one of the parties may not violate the agreement and hostilities will not resume again.

AB Introduction. The new seal of proedros Theodoros Senachereim presents the oikeios of emperor Alexios I Komnenos (1081-1118), well-known from written sources. Analysis. The finds of seals of individual representatives of the Senachereim family (Atouemes, proedros; Abou Sahl, proedros and kouropalates; Constantine, proedros, kouropalates and doux; Sebatas, protospatharios and strategos of the Serbion; John; Kourtikios and Zoe, nun), including on the territory of Bulgaria, provide grounds to suppose that the latter were administratively related in some way to the Balkan themes of Byzantium and, apparently, to the main Bulgarian centers of the Byzantine influence. Results. Traditionally, it was considered that the Senachereim and other representatives of the Armenian elite in Asia Minor disappeared from the political scene in connection with the Seljuk conquest of these territories. However, thanks to the finds of seals of the Senachereim it is obvious that the family survives at least until the beginning of the 13th century.

AB The article based on the research of medieval West European political thought's texts and mainly on the basic treatise "Policraticus" of John of Salisbury and works by other authors in XII century is devoted to analysis of concepts concerning power and society in light of "body politic" metaphor. The most representative and influential sources (and first of them is "Policraticus") transmitting the idea of "body politic" in Latin intellectual culture are researched, the metaphor usage logic and ways of its usage in polemical tradition are identified. The "body hierarchy" considered in the article focuses in medieval authors opinion not only on mystical but real social and political arrangement, it underwent definite transformations connected with power and its welder's figure reception through ages.

AB The article is devoted to examination of the basic opposition "prince/tyrant" in the context of the doctrine concerning the monarch's supreme power which was defined on the pages of the treatise "Policraticus" by outstanding English intellectual, diplomat and polemist John of Salisbury in 1159. The thinker's arguments on nature, functions and purposes of power are analysed, virtues that God-fearing monarch has and tyrant vices are considered. Studying John of Salisbury's concepts of the prince's and tyrant's power, the article affords approaches to understanding scholastic's doctrine of political power as whole which unites Hellenistic and Roman and Christian (patristic and scholastic) traditions.

AB Cotton farming, being one of the leading branches of economic activity of Turkestan of the beginning of the 20th century, attracted the attention of big investors of the Russian Empire. This article examines functioning of the Novo-Urgench branch of the Russo-Asian commercial bank (RACB) on the basis of the material from Russian State Historical Archive (RGIA): successful and unsuccessful operations, organizational structure, interaction with clients, and its influence on the regional market. The unique character of this branch of one of the largest Russian banks lay in that fact that it was the only lending and financial institution that expanded its operations throughout the entire oasis of Khiva, including territories that were under control of the Khan of Khiva. Both local political and economic elites and entrepreneurs from Central Russia were clients and partners of the Novo-Urgench branch of the bank. Wide-spread liaisons allowed the institution to promptly conquer and maintain, even under conditions of a crisis, its niche on the market of financial services in Central Asia. On the threshold of the World War I, the bank attempted to monopolize cotton farming, working with big clients and even stimulating development of the processing industry. Novo-Urgench branch of the Russo-Asian bank provided help to the local merchantry trying to increase export of raw cotton and to enter both Russia-wide and international markets. For the objective reasons of shortage of liquid assets, underdeveloped infrastructure of the region, swings in stock-exchange and problems with human resources, the Novo-Urgench branch of the Russo-Asiatic bank could not capture and control the Khivan market. During the war years, the Central Asian periphery was under the influence of the problems characteristic of not only the banking sector, but Russian economy as a whole.

AB The study of the history of Leningrad of Stalin's period was subjected to a rigid ideological impact, which is why, for a long time, it was examined selectively, in accordance with strict party attitudes. For the reason of the decades-long process of rehabilitation of the victims of the "Leningrad affair", there were no approaches in the scholarship to assessing normative and extreme everyday life in the corps of Leningrad state cadres. The article aims to present the research of the Soviet elite working norms and practices in 1945-1950. The main attention is paid to the political biographies of the Chairmen of Leningrad Local Government. The research is based on the oral history and the emotionology methods, documents from St. Petersburg, Moscow and Crimean archives. The generation of Leningrad leading cadres came to the state positions in the late 1930s, after the repressions of the "Great Terror". Members of the Soviet elite underwent testing of their professional skills during World War II and the siege of Leningrad; directed the accelerated postwar recovery of the national economy. In the late 1940s, they became the victims of the so-called "Leningrad affair". Understanding normative working routine and. and everyday life under crisis involves identifying and analyzing feelings and associated behavior. Analysis of everyday life involves identification of events and processes that recur in the personal and professional life of Soviet nomenclature workers. Understanding extreme everyday life involves identification and analysis of feelings and associated behavior in extreme conditions (such as conflicts, fabricated criminal cases, arrests, etc).

AB The revolutions of 1917 prompted a large-scale reorganization of almost all aspects of life in Russia. An important actor in its implementation was intelligentsia. Studying the biographies of the participants in that processes is important for two reasons. Firstly, it allows us to fill the gaps in the history of certain phenomena (i.e., the history of museum education in Russia). Secondly, it's important from the point of view of prosopography, as biographies promote a better understanding of certain historical types. That is important in the context of anthropological approach to the study of revolutionary events. The object of this article is the biography of one of the personalities of the first post-revolutionary years, Nikolai Emmanuilovich Soum (1879-1926). Studying chemistry at the St. Petersburg University in the 1890s-1900s, Soum to a great extent followed the path laid by his father's professional activities. However, he didn't succeed in accomplishing his studies, perhaps on the account of his father's death and failed family finances. In the 1910s, when working as a chemist, he joined in the activities of scientific and educational societies. The enlightenment pathos and practical application of science (his interest in photography) prepared the changes, which took place immediately after the revolution. Since 1918 Soum served in the Petrograd gubernia department of public education, and from 1919 he headed the Museum department of the Petrograd Institute of Out-of-School Education. One of his first projects was system of training of museum workers, one of the first in Russia. Structural changes and unfavorable political conditions hindered the implementation of the initiative. Soum, same as earlier in the pre-revolutionary period, was pushed to the periphery of cultural life.

AB The article explores the process of the formation the new Polish policy through the prism of biographies of representatives of the Kingdom of Poland who became members of the Council of State during the reign of Nicholas I. The article demonstrates that the problem of management of a huge country at the beginning of the researched period was one of the main issues. The extraordinary circumstances of the accession to the throne, that is, the dynastic and political crises, and then the revolutionary upheavals in Europe, had a decisive influence on the choice by Nicholas I of strategic priorities and tactical attitudes of state policy. A tactical means of achieving it was a new type of absolutism combining the monarch's strong authoritarian power with an improved management system, one of the most important components of which was determined by the "national" administration of Poland. At the same time, the "information war" unfolding in connection with European revolutionary events forced the supreme power to pay special attention to its ideological and institutional convergence with the political system of Russia. Given the conditions of the destruction of the system of relations with Poland that existed until 1830, the government's priority was to develop a new domestic policy that would ensure that the imperial center maintain social peace in the region by means of not only establishing a single legislative space,but also by incorporating the Polish administrative and military elite into the highest state institutions of the country.

AB Starting from the 40th anniversary of the politics of reforms in China, and probably even before that, a serious discussion began in academic circles regarding the different facets of China's experience in pursuing reforms. In this article we undertook an attempt to track certain trends in the ideological evolution of the country, drawing upon the idea that the last four decades of PRC history could be dissected into four distinct periods and they are corresponding to the rules of the successive generations of PRC leaders. Such a bird's-eye-view approach can actually help an observer to see elements of continuity as well as manifestations of change and even disconnect. The main changes in trends are connected with the policy changes as well as shifts in social and economic environment. In the evolution of the ideas realm and intellectual atmosphere one could also discern certain cyclical elements, sometimes going back to the tendencies of the past periods.
   The fourth period of ideological evolution which corresponds to the rule of the current leadership, is treated with a slightly more detailed approach. This period which actually had started with a kind of rhetorics making observers suggest a turn on the government level to a more liberal policy, in the direction of a closer integration with the Western-led international order, it later showed some mutually contradictory initiatives and pronouncements, that persuaded many observers to suggest a "turn to the Left". None of this materialised however, as the "New Chinese authoritarianism" would rather make everything possible to ensure that all major ideological camps surrender their positions, sacrificing them in favour of the great unity of the people united behind the CPC's leadership and its programmatic slogan of "the great rejuvenation of the Chinese Nation". Nevertheless, even under the conditions of trade war with the US and coronavirus debate, the public atmosphere in China still allows some room for pluralism and debate, although in a way, not easily comprehended by outside observers.

AB the current development of international scientific and technical cooperation is constrained by a whole range of economic and political factors. In such circumstances, regional ties between states are formed and strengthened, which, among other things, seek to consolidate efforts to develop international scientific and scientific and technical cooperation as one of the main factors in the sustainable development of the state and the foundation for the formation of a new and innovative type of economy. At the same time, the legal aspects of this sphere of cooperation tend to receive little attention. However, differences in national legal systems necessitate the development of uniform and understandable principles of legal regulation of international scientific and technical cooperation.
   In the study, using the method of comparative analysis, more than 20 international legal acts on the legal regulation of international scientific and scientific and technical cooperation, including documents of three major regional associations of states (The Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations), in terms of approaches to the consolidation of principles of legal regulation of scientific and scientific and technical cooperation at the supranational level, have been studied.
   As a result, the authors propose a system of principles of legal regulation of international scientific and scientific and technical cooperation, consisting of three key components: general principles of international law (lex generalis), branch principles of international scientific and scientific and technical cooperation (lex specialis), and intra-branch principles of international scientific and scientific and technical cooperation (lex internus).
   The allocation of these principles will improve the quality of legal regulation of scientific and scientific and technical cooperation at the supranational level and contribute to its further development.

AB The paper examines the problem of searching for an effective methodology for identifying, systematizing and analyzing state legal concepts of Russian political scientists of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Despite the available studies to date on individual state-legal concepts in the Russian Empire, their comprehensive research, general theoretical analysis and systematization is required, what is possible only if there is a proven methodological basis. The aim of the work is to present the stages and results of the authors' approach to the identification, systematization and evaluation of state-legal concepts in Russia in the 19th and early 20th centuries, which can be used as a basis for conducting similar studies in relation to other sectoral legal exercises. The paper substantiates the algorithm for obtaining systematic knowledge about the entire complex of state-legal concepts of the designated period showing the features of dissertational and monographic studies, the specifics of work with articles in the periodical legal press. The issues on the effectiveness of state-legal exercises are separately touched upon and a mechanism for using the forms of scientific knowledge obtained in the past is proposed to determine the novelty and relevance of the studies conducted today.

AB The concepts of "scientific paradigm" and "scientific revolution" have received many interpretations in philosophical tradition. They are taken as a starting point in studies of scientific theories change. However, the uncertainty of notions and standards for demarcation between normal and revolutionary sciences influence the proliferation of philosophical ideas, though it does not contribute to the better understanding of "Structure". The truth is that scientific revolutions do not possess the strict structure. They start from theoretical or empirical anomalies and end as a social ceremony - by accepting the new basic theories and research strategies within a scientific community. Kuhn intentionally uses the term "revolution", meaning a radical social activity for rebuilding the existing order of things. Moreover, paradigms reproduce the features of competing social systems and political camps at the cold war period. Analogy between the change of scientific paradigms and social systems is not absolutely strict. While it contributes to understanding of the nature of incommensurability and "gestalt switch" which accompany scientific development. What was more important for Kuhn - the image of revolutionary or normal science? The paradigm change appears as a natural order of things. Each type of science is not more normal than another one. But the revolutionary science is more creative and confesses the principle of "creative destruction". Regimes of normal science might be described in terms and images of virtue epistemology. Only if Thomas Kuhn does not resist to these normative prescriptions of the philosophers of science.

AB Introduction. The contemporary university in the conditions of globalization has enriched its traditional functions to educate and create new elites with attracting not only domestic students but also the foreign youth to the educational and research process. In some cases it can maintain public diplomacy held by the domestic government still influencing it via the requests made by research professionals. This influence may come through the collision of interests of both researchers with students and the government. A Russian university represents mainly the government, that's why it's important to discover its role in public diplomacy. Methods and materials. The neoliberal approach to J. Nye's concept of "soft power" gives the possibility to consider the university as a public institute enriching state's soft power through public diplomacy. Official speeches of Russian government representatives, publications of Russian researchers, university web-sites give the ground to understand the Russian approach to the methods of public diplomacy. Analysis. First of all, it's important to reveal the ways to interpret the word combination "public diplomacy" in Russian. There are several possible terms: "publichnaya", "obshchestvennaya", "narodnaya" diplomacy. The ways to use the word show different gradations of its meaning in research and political discourses which determine possible actors of public diplomacy in the Russian language. However, Russian officials in contrast to Russian researchers accept the term "obshchestvennaya" to describe the activity of government institutions in public diplomacy. That's why a university can be considered as an actor of "obshchestvennaya" diplomacy. Secondly, we reveal the ways to implement public diplomacy by Volgograd State University as one of regional universities. Results. Russian researchers following the English-language studies differentiate the concepts of "obshchestvennaya" and "publichnaya" (public) diplomacy according to the actors that implement this policy: the state cannot implement "obshchestvennaya" diplomacy, because it is a prerogative of social movements or non-governmental organizations (NGOs). At the same time, the concept of public diplomacy covers both the work of NGOs and the work of the state in creating its favorable image. However, Russian officials, trying to avoid the use of the Russian term "public diplomacy" incorrectly sounding in Russian, give preference to the phrase "obshchestvennaya diplomacy", implying that NGOs carry out public diplomacy with the help and on the initiative of the state. Moreover, they are not only public organizations who can conduct policies in this area. In other words, officials suppose that in comparison with research discourse, the circle of participants in "obshchestvennaya" diplomacy enlarges at the expense of state funds and platforms. Thus, a university that implements educational, research and publishing projects is involved in "obshchestvennaya" diplomacy. The position of the university in society, the authority of specialists whom it manages to attract, their international activity provide the soft power of the state.

AB The second half of the 1980s can be rightly called the time of lovely illusions. After a careful examination of the popular concepts at that time, which were built on the ideas of the universal consensus and conflictfree development ("new thinking", "end of history", "free world network" etc.), Yu.Artamonova and A.Demchuk reveal a number of the common premises that date back to the 18th-19th centuries. This is first and foremost about the idea that was popular among the thinkers of the Modernity that the society is "doomed" to be fair, because it is pre-established in the very sociality.
   The authors' analysis of the idea of "implicit sociality," or the pre-determined possibility of creating a "good" society, not only reveals its inherent vulnerabilities, but also indicates the presence of potentially dangerous consequences. First, it is the threat that orientation towards an ever-expanding consensus will degenerate into the coercion to a dialogue, including at the international level. Second, the inevitability of a constant revision of the institutional and legal framework of such dialogue that is not only fraught with the loss of organization, but also calls into question its very existence. But most importantly, the premise of "primordial sociality," which ultimately requires universal dialogue and consensus, de facto destroys the possibility of meaningful participation in anything. As a result, according to the authors' conclusion, the adoption of the idea of "primordial sociality" or simply the possibility of self-disclosure of some predetermined essence leads both to political incompetence and to a loss of ability to act politically.

For centuries, French kings have been fighting for the formation of a single state by joining new lands to their domain. Its foundation was completed at the end of the 15th century. In the process of strengthening the state, its power structures were also created.

AB The article is devoted to a case of reception of antiquity in political rhetoric of the early cold war (1946-1953). Political situation in the USA (anti-communism and McCarthy Era) and in the USSR (ideological campaigns of late Stalinism) pressed ancient historians much, so they used ancient history for actualization and substantiation of their position in ideological conflict. Thucydides' description of the Peloponnesian war between Athens and Sparta became a specific 'ancient Greek mirror' of the real situation in international affairs of the mid-20th c. Two scientific journals, "Classical Journal" in the USA and "Vestnik drevnei istorii" (VDI) in the USSR became the panel of political discussion on the historical background. The argumentation was close in both cases, so we may speak about specific political apology on the base of ancient history, which took place in the early cold war period.

DE history of Korea; movement for democratization in Korea; internal

AB In 2020, the Republic of Korea marks a number of significant dates associated with the so-called movement for democratization. The author traces the main milestones of this movement, drawing attention to the fact that its victories were largely achieved due not only to the activity of the democratic-minded masses, but also to Washington's willingness to surrender the insufficient regime.
   Tracing the development of the democratic trend further, the author points to the fact that the transition from authoritarian rule did not become a direct transit to democracy. Later on, actions to strengthen the Democrats in power during the Sixth Republic were carried out by far from democratic methods, including usage of the administrative resource and even the adoption of laws that had retroactive effect. Moreover, "democratic" presidents used such techniques more actively than conservatives.
   Although the positions of the civil society in the country have significantly strengthened over the past period, democratic rhetoric serves the interests of political struggle, and considering the National Security Law and some other elements of the Korean political culture, it is difficult to call the ROK a democratic country in the classical sense of these words. Rather, we are talking about "illiberal democracy", mentioned by Farid Zakaria.

AB This article considers models of the professional arrangement of North Caucasian emigres in France in the 1920s and 1930s. Using new archival and field ethnographic materials, we explore the social and political activities of North Caucasians as a profession and as a view of life; and the activities of the Caucasian group of oil owners (leader - Nobel), who before the Revolution were engaged in oil production in the Caucasus or owned shares of oil firms. France had the most cars in Europe for the 1920s and 1930s. Therefore, it was not surprising that many emigrants from Russia, including North Caucasians, began working as chauffeurs, taxi drivers, and auto mechanics. In addition, they of ten became employees of auto factories (e. g. as specialists and laborers). Since there were many military people among North Caucasian emigres, many they decided to join the French Foreign Legion. Emigrants from the North Caucasus pursued publishing, literary, journalistic, scientific, and teaching activities. In Russia many North Caucasians received a legal education but could not work as lawyers in France. Medical activity was also rare. In emigration there were several North Caucasians who became artists, singers, and dancers who performed in restaurants opened by North Caucasians. The children of the first wave of North Caucasian emigrants, as a rule, received higher education in France, and many of them managed to obtain excellent careers.

TI LAW ENFORCEMENT ISSUES: INFLUENCE OF THE ROMAN LAW ON RUSSIAN
   CONSTITUTIONIALISM
SO PRAVOPRIMENENIE-LAW ENFORCEMENT REVIEW
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Roman law; constitution; constitutionalism; reception; tradition;
   spiritual values; historical features
AB The subject. Modern law enforcement is considered in harmony with the spiritual and moral foundations of legal culture through the use of ideas and approaches of Roman law.
   The purpose. An attempt has been made to assess the influence of Roman Law on Russian constitutionalism and modern law enforcement on the basis of the spiritual and moral traditions of Russian legal culture.
   The methodology. Methods of dialectical logic, analysis and synthesis, comparative-historical, formal-legal methods were used. The main method is comparison of foundations of Roman law with the basic principles of Russian constitutionalism.
   The main results and scope of their application. The problem of influence of Roman law on Russian constitutionalism and, in general, on the basis of modern Russian law enforcement is raised. If universalism and individualism should be believed as the foundations of classical Roman law, then the basis of Russian law is community and social solidarity. In Russia collective property and joint work as well as ancestral structure in the form of a rural community reached the modern times, while in ancient Rome their disappearance was the basis of the formation of Roman law. National peculiarities of the Russian legal and political systems are determined by cultural-historical (civilizational) circumstances, especially by the natural and climatic factors. It was in the communal world of Russia that the idea of Christian equality has formed the basis of the model of life, while in Western Europe the community has followed the path of individualization of the individual and differentiation of elites and masses according to the criteria of social success. The absolute belief in law as a phenomenon of social planning and a tool for compromise between different parts of society, inherited from Roman law, formed the Romano-German and Anglo-Saxon worldview, but it did not take root in Russian legal culture. Modern Russian constitutionalism, while poorly considering the Roman-Byzantine origins of national Russian law, is wrong in its denial of the national-cultural and historical adaptation of European legal institutions and principles.
   Conclusions. One of the important results of the study is the conclusion that the social value of Roman law in Russian Constitutionalism includes the moral mission of Roman law and a high assessment of the normative value of the heritage of Roman law. The value depravity of the current Constitution of the Russian Federation can be eliminated, its defects can and should be corrected on the basis of the Roman law tradition, but this should be done only by adequately assessing the own experience of law enforcement, the thousand-year statelegal and spiritual development of the Russian civilization.

AB The article discusses techniques and methods used by the Soviet government to formulate the historical myth of the revolutionary movement in Russia and of the 1917 revolution. Holidays in Soviet Russia and later in the Soviet Union were not just days of relaxation. They served educational function, formed new spiritual values, instilled a sense of engagement with the events of 1917. As one of the ways to influence the mass consciousness, the festive events of the first decades of the Soviet power formed public opinion and influenced perception of historical and current events by the population. Popularization of the emerging official history of the new socialist state, which had begun in 1917, was especially effective during celebrations owing to their inherent emotional component. The use of historical plots in various dramatizations, mass actions, political processions, carnivals, and demonstrations of workers created an appearance of the new government's legitimacy, contributed to the formation of the collective memory of the revolutionary days within the frameworks of their official interpretation. The article uses archival materials of the Department of Agitation and Propaganda of the Central Committee of the RCP (B.), which testify to the importance that the party authorities attached to the scenarios of the festive events. Memoirs of the direct participants in the events played their role in creating heroic myth of the revolution. An obligatory element of the celebration of the anniversaries was meetings with workers revolutionaries and witnesses of the revolutionary events that were arranged at the enterprises. Participation in these "evenings of remembrance" became a way of "self-identification" of an individual in new, socialist society, for speakers, as well as listeners. During these festive meetings, appearance of belonging, not only to the heroic past, but also to the epic present, was created. Specifics and ideological implications of the 1920s-30s memoirs contributed to the use of the "memorial boom" in the forming official narrative of the revolution.

   the population; Resolution of the Politburo of the Central Committee "On
   Anniversaries"
AB The article, based on the materials of the Russian State Archive of Contemporary History and the Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History, explores the history of financing Soviet state holidays, beginning with the first anniversaries of the October Revolution. The Bolsheviks, realizing the importance of public holidays as an effective tool for legitimizing Soviet power and promoting new spiritual values, allocated significant amounts for their organization even during the economically difficult period of the Civil War. In the early years of the Soviet power, the decoration of cities and demonstrations was rather ascetic, and the money allocated for the holidays was to be used to maintain the authority of the Soviets among the Red Army soldiers. Later, the decoration of cities for the festivities on November 7 and May 1 became more varied. Preparation began in advance, decoration of cities and columns of workers was paid for by the city and district party organizations and by the trade unions. In 1925, among other grand scale anniversaries was the 20th anniversary of the 1905 Revolution. The article shows how the issue of its financing was resolved. Subsequently, the economic support of festive events, primarily on November 7 and May 1, was assigned to the enterprises. At the same time, the question of expediency of such significant expenses on decorating cities, holiday stands, and columns of workers has been repeatedly raised not only by the holiday organizers, but also by the demonstrations participants. They said that some institutions and senior executives got carried away by enthusiasm for anniversaries, ceremonies, and banquets. The Decree of the Politburo of the Central Committee "On Anniversaries" (1928) peremptorily prohibited organization of anniversaries and celebrations without special permission. In 1938, the Decree of the Council of People's Commissars of the USSR and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party of Bolsheviks "On Prevention of Spending Unnecessary Funds in Celebrating May 1, 1938" finally determined the procedure and sources of financing of the Soviet state holidays. This Decision became the basis for all subsequent decisions on financing holiday events.

AB In the context of the introduction of Industry 4.0 technologies, the task of increasing the efficiency of Russian enterprises in the transition to fully automated digital production controlled by intelligent systems in real-time is of particular importance. The most important direction of its solution is the optimization of financial planning for the development of enterprises, including forecasting the financial and economic results of their activities. The most important direction for its solution is the optimization of financial planning for the enterprises' development, including the forecasting of the financial and economic results of their activities. The complexity of solving this problem is determined by the fact that the digitalization of economy implies a new level of organization of production and management of the value chain throughout the entire life cycle of products, as well as the development of automation and data exchange in constant interaction with the external environment. In recent years, the uncertainty of the external environment of enterprises has increased dramatically due to changes in the external conditions of their industrial and economic activities. The political situation in the world has changed for the worse, which has a negative impact not only on the foreign economic activity of many Russian enterprises but also on the conditions for their innovative development. The measures are taken (import substitution, state support, etc.) aimed at neutralizing and smoothing the negative consequences of these circumstances do not yet ensure the transition of Russian enterprises to a stable production increase. Many enterprises experience fluctuations in production volumes due to the sanctions, currency fluctuations, lack of financial resources in the required volumes, low profitability, and other reasons. Taking into account these circumstances, the task of forecasting the financial results of enterprises during the implementation of Industry 4.0 technologies, in the context of fluctuations in production volumes caused by the mentioned circumstances, has acquired the most important scientific and practical value. The development of a toolkit for solving this problem is given in this paper. For this purpose, a comparative analysis of applied econometric models is carried out, designed to predict the dynamics of economic processes subjected to influences that affect the volume of production. The advantages and disadvantages of trend-seasonal models are compared with other econometric models that take into account these factors. A modified algorithm for constructing trend-seasonal models is proposed, which increases their accuracy by taking into account the functionality of modern tabular processors. It allows automating complex blocks of this algorithm. The accuracy of models built on the basis of the modified algorithm is compared with models built based on the standard algorithm. Its practical feasibility is proved when introducing the Industry 4.0 technologies.

AB The article contains a brief analysis of the situation concerning elimination of poverty and living conditions in China. It outlined basic tasks, which were posed for improvement living conditions and poverty eradication by 2021. General plan for future socio-economic development of China up to 2050 was determined by the 19th National Congress of CPC and the 5th plenum of Central Committee of CPC in 2017. First of all it included decisions how to win "three great battles": among the main tasks are poverty eradication, environment and financial problems. The CPC leadership believes that poverty eradication is an important and necessary work to secure social stability. The Chairman Xi Jinping considers that for decision of all these problems it is worth to use new technologies, especially to work with "big data". The General Secretary proposed to make big data the basis for all reforms. These plans concern poverty eradication. It is necessary to calculate carefully a number of poor regions, villages and households and to determine the level of poverty; to make all efforts for help to the poorest areas and to the most poor people. The effectiveness of this help must be controlled by corresponding structures of local authorities.
   2021 year is a significant data, this is the 100-years anniversary of founding the Communist Party of China. Deng Xiaoping planned to build "xiaokang" society up to this date, and this plan means poverty eradication. Xi Jinping repeatedly confirmed that he devoted to this aim. Poverty eradication efforts are especially important now because in 2018 China celebrated the 40th anniversary of "policy of reform and openness" which was the driver for raising economic development.

SO MIR ROSSII-UNIVERSE OF RUSSIA

DT Book Review
DE elections; president; State Duma; Crimean consensus; United Russia;
   protest
AB The publishing of the book "Elections in the Crimea" was conveniently timed for reflection. Although the election cycle of 2016-2018 has ended, taking with it the induced patriotism, a new election cycle is starting to unfold right before our eyes. You can open the book on any page, read what political scientists had to say at the time and either confidently object "this is not what it is like today!", or simply exclaim "this was not so long ago!"
   The small turnout on voting day in September 2019 forced the protest mobilization to concentrate its effort far beyond the electoral venues. The administrative mobilization forced many to only imitate the desired voting. An attempt to constrain the political expression of urban citizens through the far-fetched delimitation of electoral districts could do nothing about the growing interest of protest leaders and their followers in urban issues. The Crimean consensus enabled "United Russia" to collect enough votes in the 2016 State Duma elections, but it could not prevent the party's delegitimization, which intensified sharply after the pension reform. The attempt to disguise establishment candidates by self-nomination also failed during the 2019 Moscow City Duma elections. Instead of decreased party competition, Russia has the experience of a successful political coalition in the same election campaign. The crackdown on dissent gave rise to protests without leaders, while the regular mobilization of the administrative electorate washed out the meaning of this procedure.
   The book "Elections in the Crimea" provides an excellent opportunity to feel how time is accelerating before our eyes. It will also provide the best answer to the sceptics who believe that we live in a country where nothing changes, and time seems frozen. This "frozen time" is very accurately captured in the WCIOM book, but it ends unexpectedly, so that we can only think of it now as memories of the past. The book has also much other value, besides the historical. It provides a reference frame for understanding how far and in which direction we had moved from this frame by the end of 2019.

TI HOLY SYNOD AND POLITICAL CRISIS OF INTERREGNUM
SO NAUCHNYI DIALOG
LA Russian
DT Article
DE political crisis; interregnum; Nicholai I; Synod; oath; coup d'etat
AB The features of the development of the dynastic crisis of the interregnum of 1825 through the prism of the functioning of one of the key public authorities - the Holy Synod is discussed in the article. An analysis of the literature allows us to conclude that in modern historiography, the events of the oath to Grand Duke Konstantin received conflicting estimates. It is noted that as a result there were several interpretative schemes of what happened in the capital on November 27. An appeal to the workflow of the Synod makes it possible to assert that from the point of view of the logic of the functioning of the state apparatus, a coup d'etat took place. An analysis of everyday activities, the key bureaucratic formulas in the protocols leads to the conclusion that the bureaucratic reaction to the oath to Konstantin did not correspond to the established traditions and was distinguished by haste and internal contradictions. This was reflected primarily in the decisions of November 27: the Synod decides on the oath, relying on oral reports from the synodal members, but the next day duplicates its own decision, referring to the jurisdiction of the Senate. Moreover, a comparison with the events of December 12-14 shows that the accession to the throne of Nikolai Pavlovich was carried out in accordance with the order established in the previous century and was distinguished by deliberate legal accuracy and consistency.

DT Article
DE History of European philosophy; tradition; Russian Neo-Kantianism;
   Marburg school; Baden school
AB The article analyzes the role of Russian neo-Kantianism for the fate of European and Russian philosophy and culture. The author substantiates the idea that it was Russian neo-Kantianism, as the most influential direction of Russian neo-Westernism, that set itself the task of building an intellectual and cultural bridge between Russian and European socio-philosophical thought and successfully fulfilled it. The peculiarity of this study is that the emphasis in the analysis of various relationships between Russian and foreign thinkers is on demonstrating a sufficiently serious influence of representatives of Russian neo-Kantianism on Western European philosophers and Western philosophy. History has preserved many facts of friendly relations of Russian neo-Kantians with Western philosophers, who had their basis for fruitful creative cooperation. Being the will of fate at the "crossroads" of ideological confrontation of philosophical schools and directions, Russian neo-Kantians were able to preserve the critical "spirit" of neoKantian doctrine, independently develop it both from theoretical positions, enriching neo-Kantianism with positive achievements of phenomenology, Hegelian, religious philosophy, and from practical positions, attracting neo-Kantian methodology for the analysis of pedagogical and political-legal concepts. Also noted are the fruitful efforts of Russian neo-Kantians in the cultural and philosophical interaction between Russia and Europe - translations into various European languages of the works of Russian writers and philosophers and European - into Russian, the implementation of numerous joint cultural projects, etc.

SO NAUCHNYI DIALOG
LA Russian
DT Article
DE national self-determination; ethnopolitical processes; autonomization;
   autochthonous peoples; myth-making
AB The article considers the problem of national self-determination among the autochthonous peoples of Russia as a component of the ethnopolitical processes of the late 1980s and early 1990s. The relevance is determined by the need to study the manifested ethnic interests, inter-ethnic tension and separatist tendencies that have passed from a latent state to an open form among a number of autochthonous peoples. On the basis of comparative analysis, research of archival documents of state, departmental, personal archives and historiographical data, general trends and regional specifics of Khakas, Adygs, Shapsugs, Shors, and Teleuts are revealed. The ethno-political processes on which the ideas of national self-determination were based include the growth of ethnic consciousness, "the politicization" of ethnicity, the change of ideological paradigms, the institutional activity of national elites, the formation of national revival programs, and myth-making. The author reveals the significant commonality of myths ("search for the enemy," "loss" of national culture and other theses) and differences based on the historical and ethnic memory of each nation. Special attention is paid to the problem of autonomy. It was seen as an emerging component in attempts to implement the idea of national self-determination. The experience of normalization of social relations was considered in the analysis of the tactics used by national elites in achieving political goals, decisions made by regional authorities, and the reaction of various segments of society.

AB The paper deals with the history of the aristocratic clan of the Romanovs and the Kuchumovichi, or Sheibanyds of Siberia. The focus of the 2013-2015 excavations at the New monastery of the Saviour (Novospasskiy), held by the Institute of Archaeology RAS, was the remains of the relatives of Tsar Mikhail Romanov - brothers and sisters of his father Feodor Nikitich (Filaret the Patriarch). After the death of Ivan the Terrible, the Romanovs clan have become the most powerful group around the throne. Boris Godunov, after his election as a new Tsar, threw them out of the political field. Then, he exiled them. The most dangerous person of the Romanovs was the oldest son of Nikita Romanov, Feodor. He and his wife were enforced to took the vows, their small child Mikhail became an orphan. Four other brothers were exiled to the Northern towns and monasteries. Three of them died there under the very suspicious circumstances. The historians of Romanovs family believe that they were killed by their jailers. The Nikita' s daughters with their husbands of the noblest families, children and relatives were also exiled and some of them died far from Moscow.
   Two brothers, Vasiliy and Ivan, were sent to Siberian frontier, to the newly established Russian outpost of Pelym. The youngest brother Vasiliy died, but Ivan managed to survive. He and the rest of the clan were returned to their estates in the Central Russia after one year of the exile, in 1601.
   When Boris the Tsar died and False Dmitry I enthroned, the rest of the Romanovs were given back their high ranks. Ivan Nikitich asked a permission to transmit the remains of his brother Vasiliy from Pelym to the family cemetery of the Romanovs at the Novospasskiy monastery. Step by step the clan members' corps returned to the monastery and Ivan Nikitich erected the new burial church over their graves as the martyrs.
   The epitaphs on their grave stones were studied and published since the late 18th c. It happens that simultaneously started the study of the epitaphs of the Siberian khan Kuchum descendants. Both the texts collections were stored by the prominent scholar of the 18th c. Russia, G.F. Miller, deeply involved in the research work of Siberia. His collection was taken for the most reliable; due to it is the oldest of the copies. But the recent investigation of the documents and the excavations of the grave-church in the monastery changed our assessment of the texts collection of G.F. Miller. The cross-analysis revealed that grave inscriptions of the Romanovs and the Kuchumovichy in his famous "Portfolios" are not original but a result of a compilation of the real engravings with the monastic acts as well as other documents, transformed by historians in favor to the Romanovs. Meanwhile, there appeared the new inscriptions of the descendants of Khan Kuchum at their cemeteries of the late 17th c. in Moscow (the widow of Andrei Andreevich Kuchumovich and two their children).

AB The need to form a new political philosophy is associated with modern challenges and threats that require large-scale ordering of the world of chaos and absurdity, an adequate response to the era of "post-truth" in order to preserve the national identity of peoples, cultures, civilizations, as well as the essential features of the person himself. The instability of international relations caused by the collapse of the bipolar world has given rise to the need to create a more stable polycentric world. Countering terrorism led to the formation of anti-terrorist coalitions at the international level and for a certain time brought the world community together in the fight against a common threat. However, no one expected that the new type of war would become another test for the development of a common strategy of counteraction by mankind, requiring a rethinking of the role of man in modern political processes. Schmitt's "friend-foe" confrontation may acquire a different content in the 21st century, when man himself becomes his own enemy, since the products of his military-political and scientific activities endanger the life of all mankind. Russia's response to new political threats can be the development of a new value role of man in the emerging world order, which is possible on condition of world recognition of the civilizational originality of the Russian historical path, building a dialogue of civilizations, as well as the implementation of three ideologies in the new political dimension - patriotism, socialism, environmentalism.

AB The civilization process of social development as of the period of XX-XXI centuries caused the comprehensive development of man in the cultural and political science fields. The intensive growth of humanitarian, natural science and technical and technological knowledge has shaped the sociocultural and political activity of the population. In these conditions, political communication as a simplified version of "power-society" relationship is transformed into a separate area of human activity, which has a serious impact on personal identity. In modern conditions, political communication is not just a process aimed at transmitting any information. This is a multitude of processes where power should be considered as the source. There is a variety of processes represented in species diversity. Political communications in modern conditions have acquired the status of a social institution with its structure, internal systemic links and links with scientific knowledge, which play an important role in determining the vector of development of society.

SO LOGOS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Gilles Deleuze; antihumanism; Jean-Paul Sartre; higher empiricism;
   transversality; Henri Bergson; David Hume; conceptual characters
AB The article analyzes the evolution of Gilles Deleuze's early philosophy by bringing into focus his recently republished journalistic articles from the late 1940s, which are unfamiliar to the Russian reader, as well as his first studies during the 1950s of the history of philosophy. The paper provides a context for his philosophy within the political and aesthetic debates of the post-War period and also alongside the academic philosophy of the time. Particular attention is devoted to the influence of Jean-Paul Sartre and Deleuze's rupture with existentialism, which the young Deleuze wanted to replace with a new version of philosophical anti-humanism.
   During those years Deleuze was delving into the history of philosophy through such thinkers as David Hume and Henri Bergson, who were unusual choices at that time. In them Deleuze saw the potential for an extensive project, the "higher empiricism" which would play an important role in Deleuze's mature work over the next three decades. In his analysis of this hypothetical empiricism, Deleuze found common traits between both of those philosophers that led him to propose a new reading. That interpretation ran counter to the critical consensus of the day that pigeon-holed flume as a radical sceptic and Bergson as a spiritualist. The author concludes that Deleuze in his early work on the history of European thought had already elaborated his own particular way of working with classical philosophical texts and concepts by turning their creators into conceptual characters who were part of his own philosophical undertaking.

TI Can It Be Affirmed that the Russian State is a Special Civilization?
SO VOPROSY FILOSOFII
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Russia; civilization; economy; state; history; city; culture
AB The article raises the question: "can we consider a single state a civilization?". Based on historical and political analysis, it is shown that the state and civilization are connected indirectly with each other. As the result of the analysis of relations between the state and people are distinguishing such principal features of the state, which are not combined with the signs of civilization. It is argued that the existence of the state does not depend on civilizational principles. The state may or may not pursue policies related to the development of civilization. However, even policies aimed at the development of civilization can bring unpredictable results if it is not related to the culture of the people. This thesis is illustrated by the example of the history of Russia. Although the appearance of urban life is closely connected with the stage of civilizational development, it is obvious that references to historical examples of antiquity cannot serve as a reliable means for identifying the features that characterize civilization. With an etymological approach to the definition of civilization, as a derivative of civile, we fall into the trap of a hasty generalization, called F. Bacon "idols of the Tribe". The modern concept of a nation-state contradicts civilization both in the field of everyday discourse and in terms of cultural policy. It is argued that the only sign that defines civilization can be culture.

The author points to the origins of this concept and its relationship with the political reality. The study is based on text of the ambassadorial report, reconstructed from manuscripts. The text, known in Old Believers' manuscript tradition as the "Debate with Greeks on Faith," has been first interpreted in the way it was intended by its author who wrote it several years before the reforms of Nikon and the Schism of Russian Church.

   content analysis
AB The article is an attempt to confirm the author's hypothesis according to which Pan-Slavism at the beginning of the 20th century evolved from "cultural" and "political" to "cultural and economic". Seems that introduction of a new definition of "cultural-economic" Pan-Slavism into scientific vocabulary will improve the existing classifications of Pan-Slavism in scientific literature and overcome the dichotomy "Pan-Slavism - Neo-Slavism". According to it, at the beginning of the 20th century Pan-Slavism evolved into a new ideology, which completely broke with the views of previous generations of Russian Pan-Slavists. In authors opinion, the dichotomy appeared as a result of the long-prevailing Marxist methodology, which interpreted "Pan-Slavism" as a reactionary ideology, and "Neo-Slavism" as a "democratic and emancipative" movement. However, such conclusions seem to be a simplification, and the denial of the genetic connection between "Pan-Slavism" and "Neo-Slavism" leads to a thought that there is a "gap" between ideas of generations of ideologists of Pan-Slavism. Such conclusions are not quite correct.
   To confirm the author's hypothesis according to which Pan-Slavism at the beginning of the 20th century evolved from "cultural" and "political" to "cultural and economic", content analysis of the "Slavic Century" (1900-1904) journal's headlines, notes and annotations was conducted. This journal was chosen as the main object of study, because due to censorship bans in Russia, the "Slavic Century" journal, which was published in Vienna, was the only independent platform where important debates about the fate of the Slavs and the Slavic idea took place. These debates predetermined further transformations within the ideology of Pan-Slavism. The main point of the article is "Neo-Slavism" is only one form of Pan-Slavism.
   Three categories were used for the content analysis: politics, economics and culture. Total amount of observed headlines is 805 for four years of publication (1900-1904). The results of the content analysis showed that "political" topics occupied 6% (54 articles) of the total number of headlines, "economic" topics - 12% (96 articles) and "cultural" topics - 28% (228 articles). Total, "cultural and economic" topics were devoted to 40% of the total number of analyzed headlines that is more than any other topics combined, which fully confirms authors hypothesis.
   In conclusion, stress that at the beginning of the 20th century Pan-Slavic ideologists started to pay more attention to the issues of economic rather than political integration. However, their attitude to the cultural methods of uniting the Slavs remained strong. On the whole, the results of the content analysis made it possible to legitimate a new scientific term, expanding the existing Pan-Slavism classification in the literature - "cultural and economic Pan-Slavism". This term seems to be the most correct, as on the one hand, it emphasizes the continuity of the line of Russian cultural Pan-Slavism, and on the other hand, it highlights its main difference - the predominance of economic issues.
   The introduction of the new scientific term "cultural and economic Pan-Slavism" allows us to overcome the dichotomy "Pan-Slavism Neo-Slavism" that takes place in Russian science literature.

AB The article examines the conflicts between the civilian population of France and the servicemen of Russian corps which was a part of the allied occupation army stationed in northeastern France in 1815-1818. The Paris Peace Treaty of November 20, 1815 contained the consent of not only European monarchs, but also the French king to the introduction of an occupation regime, which meant protecting both civilians and soldiers from violence that was widespread in the previous period of active hostilities. Nevertheless, the number of contradictions between military ranks and civilians remained significant and each of the parties in the new conditions was looking for affordable ways of self-defense. Seeing the severity that the corps command showed towards the offenders from among their subordinates, the population increasingly preferred not to use violence, but to present various complaints against soldiers, demanding justice for the offense. The command, in turn, began to pay attention to the population's attempts to use complaints as a political tool and tried to suppress them. The violence against soldiers was not frequent, in fact, it did not go beyond the framework of domestic conflicts, or represented isolated cases of seemingly unmotivated aggression. The only exceptions were the regular clashes between corps soldiers and French customs officials, which often resulted in casualties and caused serious concern for both the Russian military headquarters and representatives of local authorities.

   necessity; coercion; Aristotle; V. Rozanov; I. Ilyin; M. Heidegger
AB The philosophical definition of violence today is "incomplete" and leaves a "gap" between the phenomenon and the concept. This is due to the fact that the concept of "violence" was/is strangely included in the general philosophical categorial line. In domestic and Western discourse, the problem field of violence contains, above all, political and ethical meanings. The problem is intuitively resolved in its appeal to the concept of "power", which turns out to be philosophically lost in modern philosophy. Only exceptionally do we find "traces" of this concept in philosophical works. Among them are the works of Aristotle, which need to be freed from modern, distorting interpretations. Thus, in the translations of Aristotle, the Greek used for the traditional transferring the category of possibility, lost its meaning of force (movement, ability, function); in its turn, "force" lost relation to "violence" (beta ia) and "necessity". Violence is understood as a kind of necessity, which is associated with the suppression of one's "own decision", freedom, something that "prevents desire" and contrary to "common thinking," as well as the absence of "good". Violence is presented not only in an ontological sense, but also existentially, as the opposite of "good" and of one's own "desire". Force remains in the shadow of "necessity" as "possibility", "potential energy" and "movement", and violence loses the opposition that has arisen in an ontological mode.

DE French revolution; Committee of Public Safety; Committee of General
   Security; Thermidor
AB The author focuses on the political struggle that was well under way in the National Convention during the first months after 9 Thermidor. Although it is difficult to distinguish clearly visible political groups among the deputies at this time, the overthrow of Robespierre was supported by people who had fundamentally different views on the further development of the state. Some of them wanted to abolish the temporary revolutionary order of government as quickly as possible and end the Revolution, some of them were in favor of preserving the ideals of the Montagnard dictatorship, but without Robespierre and his associates, and some of them wanted, first of all, to take revenge on the robespierristes. There were also those who set their main goal to redistribute power. The once all-powerful members of the Committee of Public Safety and the Committee of General Security planned to remain in power, agreeing only to cosmetic changes in the political system and abolishing only those terrorist laws that endangered the deputies of the Convention. However, their plans were not fated to come true. They were unable to control the ongoing reforms and find an adequate response to the general desire for renewal. The beginning of the dismantling of the system of Terror led to radical changes in the political system. The study gives an answer to the question what was the mechanism for the loss of power by the members of the Great committees, which seemed firm and was not questioned, how in a few months from the organizers of the coup de Thermidor they turned into the "tail of Robespierre" and lost political influence.

AB The paper considers trending matters of the history of World War II based on views of contemporary Russian and foreign representatives of neoliberalism. The present topic is relevant since neoliberalism supporters attempt to reconsider the key events of World War II, which is especially noticeable just before the 75th anniversary of its end. Instead of serious historical research, numerous works of neoliberal authors contain highly ideologically charged representation of the events considered, which usually has anti-Russian trends. The present paper investigates neoliberal judgments and views of Russian and foreign authors on the reasons of World War II, its beginning, the Eastern Front (which in Russia is called the Great Patriotic War) and on the image of the Soviet army. These particular aspects are usually payed special attention and considered from the perspective of the new neoliberal reading. The aim of this paper is to perform the analysis of neoliberal views on some key aspects of World War II. The authors consider the rationale proposed by neoliberals and try to identify the grounds for reconsideration of a number of events of World War II. The key method of analysis performed was the dialectical method. Such specific methods as those of analysis, synthesis, comparative-historical and problematic-chronological methods, methods of actualization, of specific and logical analysis and some other ones were applied as well. As the result of the research conducted, the authors ascertained that in both Russia and foreign countries neoliberal views on important matters of World War II stem from ideology and political interests. In fact, there is the aim pursued to substantiate the responsibility and blame of the Soviet Union for starting the war, inhumanity of soviet regime and barbarity of the Soviet army. To attain this, in the context of informational war that is currently taking place all means are used from distortion of facts to fabrications and outright lies. Such methods are obviously unscientific and have nothing to do with historical research. The political objective of the ideological campaign run is to show Russia, which is the legal successor state of the Soviet Union, as the aggressive country that treats the free liberal world. The proceedings of the present paper may be relevant for historians, political analysts and theorists as well as for those who are engaged in World War II and particularly its Eastern Front.

DE anti-Machiavellianism; Machiavelli; monarchism; absolutism;
   westernisation; eighteenth-century Russia
AB This article studies the role of the anti-Machiavellian vision of politics in the development of political thought in westernising eighteenth-century Russia. The author disputes S. Whittaker's idea that the images of good and bad monarchs in eighteenth-century Russian "advisor literature" (rooted in the tradition of "princely mirrors") served as a kind of political programme which the ruler was to follow (i. e. imitate good models and avoid bad ones). In "advisor literature", one can distinguish a descriptive component, which, using the image of ideal monarchs, consolidated the status quo in the minds of subjects, and "advice" proper, suggesting a situation with several competing solutions. This type of advice was available in various spheres of state administration, including the political life of the court itself. Tracing the transformation of the genre of "princely mirrors" in Europe makes it possible to identify and understand the political implications in its Russian counterpart, Being challenged by Machiavelli, who replaced Christian ethics in politics with an immoral "state interest", sixteenth- and seventeenth-century European intellectuals produced a set of anti-Machiavellian ideas to incorporate the Machiavellian idea of political efficiency into Christian morality, prove that the most effective system of behaviour was following the ethical norms of Christianity, and develop some practical guidelines for success at court. In the eighteenth century, a number of anti-Machiavellian writings from previous centuries were translated into Russian (circulated as manuscripts and published works) and were in demand among the intellectual elite. Therefore, researchers have to consider the anti-Machiavellian influence on Russian political culture in the Enlightenment, particularly in the development of ideas about the relationship between politics and morality and the status of politicians.

DE historiography; China; USA; World War II; The civil war in China
AB The historiography of the problem of researching the image of China in the USA is considered. A comprehensive analysis of the evolution of the historiography of the image of China in 1931-1949 in the United States is proposed through the study of the specifics of the perception by the political elite, the military, the public and the US media of the most important events of the "Chinese crisis". It is noted that this approach allows us to talk about the formation of a special phenomenon of the socio-political life of the United States, the reconstruction and explanation of which are impossible within the framework of the traditional methodology of historical research and require an interdisciplinary approach based on historical imagology. It is shown that the formation of the image of China in 1931-1949 in the historiography of the United States by the American press is represented with several thematic areas: the first - the studies of American assessments of China in general works on the history of international relations before the Second World War and during its course; the second is a study of the history of the formation of American assistance to fighting China; third, analyzing China's assessment of the United States in the context of the history of colonialism and decolonization; fourth, examining the image of China in the context of a study of public opinion in the United States. It is pointed out that the analysis of historiography indicates that China in the crisis period of history was in the focus of attention of both journalists and the academic community.

AB Introduction. As a social group with its specific features and motivation, students have been long characterized by their active involvement in social and political unrest. However, the behavioral analysis of students in different historical situations has become an independent research topic as late as in the 1960s. Numerous nuances of student activity remain for that reason unexplored. That is true of the process of student politicization and nationalization in the multi-ethnic Austrian empire during the tumultuous year of 1848. In literature, this issue is either pushed aside or based on an image of a radical "Austrian" student helping proletarians to fight against the regime on barricades. The latter is not relevant in view of the diversity of student sentiments and ideas that were present in the vast Habsburg hereditary lands. Methods and materials. This article analyzes students' sympathies and actual participation in the rebellious events of 1848 considering the cases of two universities - that of the capital city of Vienna and the university of provincial Innsbruck. The study is based on students' memoires, pamphlets, letters and newspapers of that time, as well as official documents and appeals by the government. Analysis. The analysis shows that Viennese students had an effective voice in revolutionary events, but their demands were of relatively moderate liberal character, while they largely remained loyal to the emperor. The revolutionary activity of provincial students was much more modest and peaceful than in Vienna. In case of Innsbruck, in particular, an image of a patriotic student fighting with arms for his emperor and fatherland replaced the image of a student fighting for political freedoms. Results. The participation of students in the revolutionary events of 1848 resulted in politicization of the "Austrian" student body and its consolidation as an independent social group.

AB The correlation of national, supranational, trans-regional, and international legal systems is a concern of comparative legal (including their political science and international relations aspects) studies because it has decisive influence on how States position themselves within the family of nations, perceive themselves in the surrounding world community, and build relations with other nations, international organizations, and the international community as a whole. At the same time, the correlation has immense pragmatic significance, for it is the essential basis for determining which of the multi-level management legal systems operates and/or prevails when the rules binding on individuals, societies, businesses, civil services, international organizations, and interstate communities are formed within or outside of national jurisdictions. Study of this correlation is of particular importance in the context of the growing complexity of the international legal field and multilevel management systems, as well as in the light of current trends in the development of international economic and political processes. On the one hand, the growing international confrontation and misuse of international legal instruments are forcing States to take measures to protect their internal law systems. On the other hand, the need to build harmonious international cooperation requires them to open their legal systems to some extent. The article discusses the experience of various integration structures in this context. The authors claim that the project of the Greater Eurasia has the advantage of sharing a common Soviet legal heritage, which already establishes a common legal language and cohesive terminology - factors that have, for example, restrained EU integration efforts. Whatever the CIS may or may not have achieved, meeting expectations or otherwise, it represents nearly three decades of integration experience.

AB The article discusses opposition to extremism in modern Russia. We have to admit the fact that, along with the positive characteristics of the younger generation, alarming symptoms of social and political immaturity began to appear; loss of national cultural identity; individualism and egocentrism; deviant behavior, militant nationalism; diversification of cultural and spiritual values, lack of life perspectives and self-actualization. Therefore, special attention is paid to the processes of integrating youth into the social life of society. The analysis of documentary materials shows that for the period from 1993 to 2015. inclusively adopted a number of Decrees of the Government of the Russian Federation on issues of reforming youth policy.
   The reasons that lead to the formation of antisocial and extreme groups are shown. The emergence of an all-new subcultural youth organization of an asocial orientation is an unconditional relapse caused by the lack of a program to prevent extremist attitudes among the younger generation that is adapted to modern socio-cultural and economic conditions. The tendencies of students' perception of the problems of extremism and interfaith tolerance in Russia are manifested in the fact that the majority of the population consider extremism a negative, unacceptable and condemned phenomenon. At the same time, the growth of extremist attitudes is possible, depending on the political situation and the intensification of the struggle for power of ethnopolitical movements.

So, in memory of the executed anarchists, the Paris Congress of the Second International declared 1st May as the Day of Solidarity of Workers of the World. But these events had a deeper influence on the three great women of their time: Lucy Parsons, the widow of one of the executed anarchists, who actually began her political career with the defense of the memory of her husband, Voltairine de Cleyre, then a young girl who was to become the "poetess of American anarchy", and Emma Goldman, the most famous anarchist in the United States.

The main sources of the study include archival documents, especially the materials of investigation cases and statistical outputs that are introduced into scientific circulation for the first time. The study defines two migration flows of the Bulgarians to the Ural - from the places of their traditional settlement in the Western regions of the USSR due to collectivization and dispossession of kulaks and from different regions of Bulgaria - as a consequence of political emigration. Ural Bulgarians that came to the region as a result of voluntary and forced migrations took part in industrialization process and worked mainly in i industrial enterprises and forestry administration. Many of them were subjected to repressions during the period of 1937-1938.

TI LENIN'S NOTION OF CLASS AS A CASE OF POLITICAL CONCEPTUALIZATION
SO SOTSIOLOGICHESKIE ISSLEDOVANIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Marxism; classes; class interests; class differentiation; mobilization;
   revolution
AB Vladimir Lenin is known primarily as a practical revolutionary, his contribution, however, to radical transformation of society involves introduction of considerable changes into the class concept. He treated class as a social group that stands apart from other social groups due to its employment and its own specific world outlook. Classes are heterogeneous social groups that make it impossible to solidify them in the struggle for social change. Real, not theoretical classes, are disposed to compromises and appeasement. In a country with a backward agricultural economy in which society was under constant pressure from the authoritarian regime, real changes could only be effected by way of mobilizing a small, unwavering minority, organized into a network of underground local groups. Small militant party with cadres capable to work underground should be placed at the center of the network. Lenin believed that the party must stay in power even after the revolution in order to withstand the pressure of petty bourgeois elements. The Leninist concept of class as an ideal type with a set of social interests maintained by a small group of revolutionaries dovetailed with the reality of an agrarian society in which socialist modernization could only be effected through utmost centralization and mobilization. Lenin's concept of constructed classes was losing its relevance in the Soviet society that was evolving towards modernity.

AB This article questions the reemergence of scientific antireligious activist movements in the last centuries. Considering intellectual and political aspects of scientific materialism, Monist and New Atheism movements' programs as well as the historical context of their development a number of structural similarities is being drawn. Notably, the Darwinian theory of evolution in monistic dysteleological interpretation represents the main rhetoric weapon of atheistic science popularizers against opponents. Also, science is employed as a tool of 'freethought' communities' formation and campaigning for irreligious rights and against creationism's intellectual expansion. However, if earlier atheistic science popularizers were quite explicit on their world change ambition, contemporaries show no interest to author some new science-inspired worldview systems or political projects.

DE autocephaly; orthodox; religious studies; history of Religion in Russia;

AB The article is devoted to the study of the problem of autocephaly of Orthodox Churches in Russia during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Interest in this aspect of aspect of Orthodox ecclesiology and canon law intensified not only because of the development of Orthodox theology in Russia, but also due to the fact that this problem acquired political significance. It was connected with some matters of domestic and foreign policy of the Russian Empire. The annexation of Georgian in the early nineteenth century and liquidation of the autocephaly of the Georgian Church by the decision of the secular authorities provided the enduring source of the anti-governmental mood among Georgian elite, traditionally closely connected with the local clergy. The foreign policy interests of the empire in the Near East and Asia Minor also contributed to the intensification of research in the field of ecclesiastic history and the modern structure of ancient patriarchates. The greatest factor that contributed to an increase in such research interests was the emergence of new autocephalous churches: the Greek and Bulgarian churches separated from the Patriarchate of Constantinople. Separation of the Bulgarian Church provoked an aggressive polemic in the Russian press. The problem of nationalism was highlighted, which is significant for the Orthodox tradition. As an attachment to the article, the authors include the text of a report on the possibility of the autocephaly of the Georgian Church composed by Vladimir Beneshevich in 1917. The report was made upon request of the Provisional Government and it is preserved in the collection of Beneshevich at the St. Petersburg Branch of the Archive of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE Korean Peninsula; denuclearization; American-North Korean and
   inter-Korean relations; comprehensive peaceful resolution in Korea;
   Korean War; Armistice Agreement; Peace Treaty; security arrangement in
   the North East Asia
AB The article considers a wide range of issues related to the tasks of providing permanent and durable peace on the Korean Peninsula. The problem of concluding a Peace Treaty instead of the Armistice Agreement is a cornerstone in building a new non-confrontational framework capable to provide the security of all parties involved as well as in establishing the conditions for equal cooperation between them. The authors argue that the realization of those tasks was possible due to positive developments in the American-North Korean and inter-Korean relations. In accordance with the Panmunjom Declaration signed by the leaders of the DPRK and the ROK, the two sides agreed to cooperate in bringing an end to the state of armistice and establishing a firm peace regime through multilateral meetings involving both sides as well as the United States and China. Another important step was the Comprehensive Military Agreement signed between two Koreas, which envisaged promoting arms control and introducing confidence-building measures. However, despite a certain warming of the climate on the Korean Peninsula, the transition from political declarations to practical steps for benefit of a comprehensive peaceful resolution has proven to be very difficult because of existing deep contradictions between the parties involved. The authors' view is that as of now, the parties concerned have failed to launch any ad hoc multilateral arrangement aimed at outlining the contours of the future peace-building order on the Korean Peninsula. The reason is that the failure to settle the long-standing nuclear issue has obstructed progress on all the tracks, including the peace process there. In this vein, special attention is devoted to Russia's approach and perspective. The authors illuminate that participation in the process of peaceful settlement of the key issues on the Korean agenda meets the vital interests of Russia in the context of tasks related to the establishment of the security and cooperation arrangement in the region of North East Asia.

DT Article
DE Archival documents; human capital; students; Soviet higher education;
   family; youth; socio-cultural values
AB The article addresses various aspects of the Bolsheviks' policies in formation of the new Soviet student community in the 1930s. In the view of the Soviet government, new man, obedient and energetic builder of the socialist society, should not be burdened by the past, its images, traditions, and customs, be it at mundane or social level. As a result, there were major changes in the family policy aimed at equalization of men and women and at fighting patriarchy. The article discusses the implications of this policy for the student environment and changes in the Soviet policy toward students in the 1930s. As has been mentioned in the preceding article, In the 1920s the state regarded higher education as an institute for "production" of "human capital," as well as that of specialists. In its social and political practices of the 1930s, the AUCP (B) continued to realize the concept of Soviet higher education system and formation of the "Soviet human capital." But these years saw certain changes and adjustments: while in the 1920s the emphasis was placed on essential radical measures, in the following decade the ruling party returned to traditional, classical models of educational process in its activities in the field of higher education, with due regard to grandiose plans for socialist construction. The authors reveal a correlation between the negative consequences of the 1920s transformations and the subsequent reaction of the state aiming at resolution of problematic situations.

DT Article
DE identity; Kryashens; nationalism; national movement; religious revival;
   Russian Orthodox Church; ethnopolitical mobilization
AB The article is devoted to the analysis of the role of the religious factor in the development of the sub-ethnic national movement studying the case of the Kryashens. The study is based on Jose Casanova's concept of the religious revival. Following Casanova, the author assumes that religious identity can become the basis of an ethnic identity only if religion transforms from a state-oriented institution into an institution oriented towards the society and actively participating in its improvement. At the same time, revealing the dynamic nature of the formation of the (sub)ethnic groups, the author relies on the ethnosymbolic concept of John Hutchinson, which focuses on the importance of the ethnically significant symbols. In the case of the Kryashens a religious marker represents such a symbol.
   The article examines in detail two stages of the Kryashens' religious revival. The first stage occurred in the second half of the 19th century and was associated primarily with the missionary activity of Nikolay Ilminsky. The second stage started in 1989 and continues today. The research carried out by the author lends unequivocal support to the idea that religion played a key role in the formation of an original Kryashen ethno-cultural identity. At the same time, it shows that within Kryashens' religiosity the vector is directed from society to religion rather than from religion to society. Their religious identity is instrumental. However, although there are very few ultra-religious people in the Kryashen community and most of the Kryashens are secularized, religion remains one of the most important markers of their ethnic identity.

ID CHIEFS
AB Histories of the countries of West Africa and their peoples are very diverse, yet in terms of political traditions, these states share more similarities than differences. Among the factors permitting us to make this claim is the viability of the institution of chieftaincy, i.e., the preservation by traditional leaders of power and influence on the economic and socio-political development of local communities, regions and even nations. The present paper is dedicated to the institution of chieftaincy in West Africa, particularly in Ghana, where this institution has significantly evolved over the past hundred years amid the struggle for survival, power and control over local resources. Existing research on this subject is primarily concerned with the role of African traditional institutions during the pre-colonial and colonial periods. This paper attempts to fill this gap and consider the evolution of the institution of chieftaincy until the present time.

AB In the article the author reviews the peculiarities of the Taiwan modern political system development and the conditions of the "normal" opposition to DDP ideological platform formation in the presence of the "deep-state" management and the mass media influence in the electoral campaigns on the island, in conducting of which (as well as in the main parties' structures) there are outlined some changes in the nearest future. Also, there are analyzed the main perspectives of Taiwan development especially under the influence of the already arisen world economic crisis at the background of the pandemic COVID-19 consequences. At the general elections held in Taiwan on January the 11, 2020 there won the victory Tsai Ing-wen, the candidate from the DPP and current President of the Republic of China in Taiwan since 2016, and represented by her party which won more than half seats in the Legislative Yuan. Guomindang party, which won only one third of seats, remains the main opposition force. The DPP victory fixed and strengthened the course on turning away from the policy on gradual rapprochement between the two sides of the Strait pursued by the Guomindang former administration of the island. The DPP victory also aggravated the main contradiction inside Taiwan socium concerning the development of the cross-Strait relations, apparently revealed itself in the opposite approach to these relations on the part of the considerable number of the young voters and on the part of the aged generation.
   Tsai Ing-wen and the DPP got the demonstrative support on the part of the officials of the USA, Japan, France and other states and expected negative reaction on the part of Beijing administration, the more so, after Tsai Ing-wen and Taiwan administration other representatives' sharp declarations, which followed the DPP victory at the elections, containing demonstrative non-recognition of Beijing formula "one state - two systems",
   At the background of the existed on the island social-political contradictions and external @ANNOT2 = situation, which is characterized by the aggravation of the global economic crisis, being deepened by the growing contradictions between the USA and the PRC and the COVID-19 global pandemic outbreak, simultaneously there is growing the factor of uncertainty in the further situation development in Taiwan and around it.

AB The article is devoted to the secured in the PRC Constitution political and ideological principals of the CCP power and suggested by the party directions and tasks on the state management. First of all, the question is about the place and the role of the CCP in the PRC political system, about the party, which came to power as a result of the victory over the Guomindang after a long-term revolutionary war, which for so many years has been leading the state along the "curving way" of socialism with Chinese specifics construction. Here calls attention the absence or on the contrary the presence of the direct indication of the CCP leading role in the first Constitution of 1954 adopted soon after the PRC formation, in the Constitution of 1975 adopted at the end of the "cultural revolution" period, in the Constitution of 1978 adopted after the "cultural revolution" coming to an end and in the Constitution of 1982 adopted at the beginning of the policy of reforms and opening conduction before amendments introduction in 2018.
   Also, in the article, there are discussed secured in the Constitution main compounds of the CCP ideological-political platform. In fact, it means, the compounds forming the PRC official state ideology from "Mao Zedong's ideas" to "Xi Jinping ideas about the socialism with Chinese specifics of a new epoch". This ideology, as it is seen from the process of Constitutions adoption and amendments introduction in them, is being continuously reviewed following the deep changes in China's political and economic life, including at the current stage of its historic development.
   Besides, in the article, there is touched upon the subject of the happening during the last quarter of the century process of the state unification which, in fact, means assumed by the CCP constitutional obligation to complete this process.

DT Article
DE ODA; soft power; infrastructure; Japan; Central Asia; Shinzo Abe
AB The article analyzes the official development aid (ODA) as a tool for ensuring Japan's interests in Central Asia. The author puts forward an idea that ODA reflects the complex nature of Japan's foreign policy which is a combination of a strategies based on national interests, efforts at implementation of liberal values and seeking common Asian identity. The research starts from the brief overview of history of the ODA and then proceeds to the coverage of Japan's ODA towards Central Asia to demonstrate how the evolution of Japan's political priorities manifested itself in the country's assistance policy. The author uses quantitative and qualitative analysis of ODA to Central Asia as well as content analysis of the key documents on diplomacy and ODA. The research then focuses on the main directions of assistance and studies how they relate to Japan's foreign policy goals. Further attention is given to the role Japan plays in the region, by assessing her position among the main donors of Central Asia as well as the significance of its aid from the point of view of economic development of the region, ODA's security role and Japan's efforts at preserving the cultural heritage of the region. The author comes to the conclusion that realism-based objectives such as getting access to the natural resources of the region, securing its geopolitical stance in the heart of Eurasia and ensuring the support for Japan's bid to the UN Security Council seat by five Central Asian states dominate Japan's ODA policy. It is also influenced by external factors, such as US-Japan military alliance and Japan's geopolitical rivalry with China. At the same time, much of Japan's efforts are directed at liberal goals such as promoting democracy in the region with Japan being a role model for democratization, supporting modernization and market economy. Assisting economic development and helping settle security issues with an emphasis on human security projects demonstrate not only Japan's desire to boost its positive image in the region but also enhance its international reputation and its vision of Central Asia as a ground for cooperation with other countries. The author comes to the conclusion that cultural ODA is directed at objects related to shared history, mainly at preservation of the Buddhist heritage which Japan sees as a foundation for common identity and which underlies its connections to the Silk Road.

AB The article explores the process of changing the emperor's opinion regarding Russian policy on the Korean Peninsula, which led to the war with Japan in 1904, based on previously unpublished documents of the Russian State Historical Archive addressed to Nicholas II. The main goal of the article is the historical and political characterization of the reasoning for securing Russian strategic interests on the Korean Peninsula and East Asia, presented to Nicholas II by representatives of "Bezobazov Circle" between the time of N.G. Matyunin was the first charge d'affaires with Korea and the creation of viceroyalty in the Far East. A related goal was the introduction into the scientific circulation of new documents containing the reflection of events that were turning points for Russia and entailed irreversible social and political processes that led to the disaster of 1917. Having regard the poor amount of scientific material and research positions on this issue, and a number of cliches formed in the Soviet period in relation to the events and personalities studied, the scientific novelty of the work presented are an attempt to rethink the arguments and actions of the participants of the "Korean project" is not from the perspective of court intrigues and struggle for influence and in the light of the imperial ideology and the natural needs of the process of expansion of the Russian empire in the Far East. For the first time in Russian historiography, not extracts from documents are presented, but parts of them that allow the reader to independently conclude the validity of the author's judgment. Particular attention is paid to arguments calling for the strengthening of Russia's position in the region and the mechanisms for their support, since, after a century, this task has not lost its relevance. In the end, conclusions are drawn that differ from the position established in science about the reasons for the failure of the investigated project and the role of each of its participants. The main conclusion is that Nicholas II often received "refined" information during active attempts to manipulate his consciousness and beliefs, which led to a change in his opinion about Russia's foreign policy in this direction but did not ensure the success of the project.

AB This year marks the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Russia and the Republic of Korea. Very soon after their establishment political and economic realities highlighted the limits of bilateral cooperation, and these limits became even more evident in recent years with international politics growing increasingly polarized. Nonetheless, this rigid and narrowing framework does not prevent the parties from maintaining a remarkable level of mutual understanding and avoiding major conflicts, which is quite rare in current global politics. For Moscow, South Korea is a partner that is unwilling to discard previous achievements when international climate changes, making Seoul important for Russia's 'pivot to the East' strategy. Seoul sees our bilateral relations as valuable, since they are not riddled with historical disputes, like interaction with Japan, and are free from reservations that come with 'over-engagement', like relations with China or the US. 'Weakness' of our ties is not necessarily a negative trait; it can be viewed as an asset. It allows Moscow and Seoul to remain flexible in their policies, and lower stakes mean lower risks. Although Russia and the Republic of Korea often pursue hardly compatible political goals, their relations are free from major controversies, they are develped enough to yield tangible results and are yet to peak. This combination leaves room for optimism about the future.

AB The article analyzes how the 'comfort women' issue influences current relations between the Republic of Korea and Japan. In the early twentieth century Japan annexed Korea, and the memories of colonial-era humiliation are vivid in Korean collective consciousness. As a result, issues of the past often sour bilateral relations even today. Recently, Seoul has been actively pressing the issue of sexual slavery in Japanese military brothels, and differences over this seemingly irrelevant issue have impeded political and military cooperation.
   Articles on former sexual slaves (also called wianbu in Korean) have resurfaced time and again in Korean press throughout the 1940-80s, but the problem internationalized only in the 1990s, when broad public discussion started. Although Japan maintains that the 1965 bilateral normalization resolved all issues of the past, Tokyo has several times offered official condolences and compensations to the victims, however Seoul found these steps or the tone unsatisfactory. Most recently, in 2015 Abe Shinzo and Park Geunhye signed an agreement to close the wianbu issue, but the document irritated South Korean public and opposition, so Seoul abandoned it. President Moon Jaein, who came to power in 2017, continued this course and added pressure on related historical problems, such as Korean forced laborers in imperial Japan. As the crisis deepened, Tokyo introduced economic sanctions against South Korea (technically on unrelated grounds).
   Conflicts stemming from collective memory are a characteristic feature of North East Asian political culture. They are a popular tool in foreign and domestic policy of many countries. This, coupled with irrational nature of nationalism and imperfection of regional security, makes issues of the past a very real threat to the present.

The US move to China's overt containment is most pronounced in the economic, commercial and technological areas. D. Trump administration has also significantly increased pressure on China over the most sensitive political and humanitarian issues.
   The trade war unleashed by Washington was suspended in early 2020 in result of the signing of the first phase of a trade deal between the United States and China. Obviously, this agreement represents a way to a truce, but not to final settlement of trade and economic contradictions. Both sides got the opportunity to regroup forces in anticipation of a new round of confrontation.
   The rivalry between the two great powers covers a wide range of technologies. It is highly likely that during the 2020s, China and the United States will create two competing and increasingly incompatible global ecosystems of the development of the Internet of things, big data processing technologies, 5G mobile communications, additive technologies, robotics, etc. The choice of one of the ecosystems will at the same time become a geopolitical choice, which, obviously, during the next decade all states in the system of international relations will have to make.
   The pandemic of coronavirus COVID-19 has become a new important factor in the further aggravation of the bilateral relations. China was the first major state to achieve a turning point in the fight against the disease. In turn, the US administration gave a new impetus to escalation of anti-Chinese rhetoric. The implications of these developments for the existing world order are discussed in the final part of the article.

DE Xiang gang (Hong Kong SAR); Catholicism; civil activity; generations'
   distrust; new identity; protests; demonstrations; religion
AB In the article there is analyzed Hong Kong religious (Catholic) organizations' experience in attracting the potentially protesting part of the population with the aim of social changes achievement. Filling the space in the thoughts, theory and strategy of the participants of the social movements for asserting Hong Kong's right for its own future, the religious organizations herewith managed to become part of the SAR's arising civil society.
   The reason for the high civil activity (in this research it is considered since 2013) in Hong Kong is not only in the "generations distrust", but also in the growth of inequality and difficulties in finding employment, in the disbelief in the justice, low belief in the government and elites, in the apprehension about reinforcement of suppression for the part of the Central government and curtailment of the main human rights and freedoms. The appearance of the youth protest movements representing "a new generation of local identity", autonomous and critically minded, is quite natural. It is just that very growth of a strong local identity of a Hongkon? ger which the continental China authorities are so anxious about to the extent of not permitting to introduce universal suffrage in the SAR in order to avoid Hong Kong secession simultaneously to avoid similar things in the contiguous regions of the continental China.
   The difference of the protest movements lies in the management and in the "generations conflict": the movement "Occupy Central" in 2013 used to have efficient managing force and organizational structure, when the "Umbrella Revolution" in 2014 was relatively loose, the participants acted proceeding from their own motivation without special leadership. In the second movement there dominated the young people distinguished by ideological persuasion, while the movement itself was more intensive and large-scaled.
   Catholic Church actively participates in the social movements, including their participation in the management on a definite stage for the purpose of fundamental and universal values preservation such as human rights and freedom. Catholic Church happened to be involved in the struggle for democracy and religious freedom, as middle and professional class has become politically active because of the fear facing the authoritarian Communist management of the continental China and this class required Church's support. This Catholic Church's role, isn't played due to the political motives, but religious ones, thus there are made efforts to defend the main Christian values and human rights. At the same time Buddhists and Taoists didn't participate in the social movements (though among Taoists there were exceptions) as they have been in quite a long time agreement with the government's activity.

DT Article
DE identity; identification; discursive practices; autobiographical text;
   Uralmash
AB The article is devoted to the study of factory identity based on the material of autobiographical texts of Uralmash workers written in 1967-1984. The novelty of the research is in the theoretical approach to identity as a discursive concept, which is structured by systematically recurring themes in personal narratives. The main focus is on ideological meanings in autobiographical texts. Their ritual and integrative functions are established, which are realized in the analyzed texts. The leading role of ideological meanings in describing the construction of a plant and in constructing the image of the enemy and the threat posed by it for the plant and the collective is shown. The ways to include memoirs of the theme of victims of political violence in the 1930s in the texts and to restore their names in the factory biography are discussed in the article. It is proved that the introduction of the theme of victims of political repression, as well as ritual formulas of ideological loyalty, reproduced by naive authors with involuntary distortions and deviations from the norms of written literary speech, results, among other things, in "corrosion" of the Soviet official discourse and is one of the factors that led to the "performative shift" characteristic of the late Soviet era. The analyzed text material has not previously been the object of research.

AB The purpose of this work is to identify the potential and limitations of online network communities to strengthen the position of the democratic political regime. The study was conducted using the example of Internet communications in the USA and France. The principles of comparative analysis and quantitative content analysis were used as a methodological basis. Additional methodological optics were elements of SWOT analysis. The analysis showed that the American and French democratic political regimes actively use online network communities to strengthen their positions in society. At the same time, it is revealed that the largest online political communities are groups of leaders, which is interpreted by the authors as a general pattern in the two studied countries - the growth of populism. The increasing role of populism is associated with the phenomenon of mediacracy - the dependence of the modern political process on media corporations and media platforms, including online ones, which establish a specific format of media journalism for political actors. The strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of online communities for preserving democracy are also identified.

TI "DEEP" DEMOCRACY AND POLITICAL AUTHORITY
SO POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY
   OF POLITICS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE political authority; evolution; cooperation; supernatural punishment;
   democracy; biopolitics
ID POWER; EVOLUTION; BEHAVIOR; BRAIN
AB The article is devoted to the problem of political authority and its features in the modern democratic communities. The author interprets authority as a socio-political institution that is rooted in the biological nature of a human and has been evolving throughout the history. According to his concept, trust in political authority is determined by faith in the external force that delegates this authority - God, imagined community in the form of a Nation or a State, or a value system - this is what Democracy is. Subordination to democratic authority (unlike other types) is based on a "new" normative (moral) foundation: it is "this country is right, therefore it is mine" rather than "regardless of whether it is right or wrong, this is my country".
   The author's argument in general justifies the traditional defense of liberal democracy. Although he admits that the postmodern and anarchist critics of democratic authority have their own logic and reasons, he points out that some of their statements are inconsistent with the latest empirical data, including data from the field of biopolitics. From his point of view, since the main institutional foundation of democracy is the value system and citizens' belief in this system, democracy in principle is not jeopardized by the "emergency situation" that predisposes reconstruction of the authoritarian practices. This is also because a high level of interpersonal trust, solidarity, faith in democratic values and accountability will restore the "open society" regime. Liberal democracy is threatened by the sentiments of frustration, panic and fear, and if they prevail, democracy can really be hurt.

TI Transnational Diaspora: Interaction of Jewish Elites and the Poliakovs
SO VESTNIK SANKT-PETERBURGSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-ISTORIYA
LA English
DT Article
DE Jews; transnational; intimacy; sociability; philanthropy; the Poliakovs
AB Recently historians have come to recognize the need to go beyond national history and to acknowledge the transnational, which became so important in the globalization of 1870-1914. It is no less essential to expand the focus beyond economics alone and to consider the array of other factors, especially cultural and religious, that were ever more powerful and capable of transcending national boundaries. One key analytic framework in recent scholarship is "intimacy," which focuses on the social nexus and political connections that were so critical in the rise of the new industrial-financial elites across Europe. This paper examines the case of the Poliakovs, a Russian Jewish family that began as petty merchants in the Pale of Settlement but became leading bankers, railroad barons, and factory owners in late Imperial Russia. Drawing on family records (especially the diaries of two family members) but also an array of archival and printed sources (including the societal pages of leading French and German newspapers), this paper examines: a) how the Poliakovs learned to "perform" successfully in aristocratic high society; b) how and why that performance was so critical to the family's perceived affluence (and hence the credibility of their various businesses); c) how the transnational served simultaneously to cement the family's status in the Russian elite and to become part of the Jewish diaspora (not only to promote business but to avoid intermarriage). This was a family business in the fullest sense: the family was the business.

TI EXEMPTION OF A JOINT STOCK COMPANY FROM THE OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE
   INFORMATION TO A SHAREHOLDER
SO PRAVOPRIMENENIE-LAW ENFORCEMENT REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE Corporation; business company; joint stock company; shareholder rights;
   information; disclosure of information; provision of information;
   sanctions
AB The subject of research. Issues concerning the exercise of the right of shareholders to receive information are analyzed. The focus is on the issues of exemption of a joint-stock company from providing information. The development of the institute of the information provision to shareholders by joint stock companies are consistently analyzed. The main trends in the development of this institute are shown: gradually narrowing the ability of shareholders to exercise their right to receive information through such means as restriction, differentiation and exemption from providing information. Special emphasis is placed on the institute of exemption from providing information.
   The purpose of the article is to show the main drawbacks of the existing model of exemption of a joint-stock company from the obligation to provide information to shareholders and to formulate directions for the development of legislation. The author's main scientific hypothesis can be summarized as follows. The Federal law "On joint-stock companies" contained an initial defect in the description of information exchange between a shareholder and a joint-stock company. The shareholder's right to information was not described, in fact, it was "embedded" in the obligation of the joint-stock company to provide information. The subsequent changes to the law resulted in a narrowing of the rights of the shareholder, practically depriving the minority shareholder of the right to information. This defect has led to significant legal uncertainty when the joint- stock company exercises its right to be exempt from providing information. This uncertainty should be eliminated, because the regulatory goals for granting joint-stock companies an exemption from the obligation to provide information to shareholders (article 92.2 of the Federal law "On jointstock companies" that counters sanctions pressure) are absolutely correct. At the same time, some of the grounds for exemption from the obligation to provide information to shareholders (article 92.1 of the Federal law "On joint-stock companies") must either be excluded or reformulated. The author notes the complete "break" between the current regulation and the ideas about information exchange between a shareholder and a jointstock company, that initially inspired the creation of the law on joint-stock companies. The inclusion of sanctions in the law on joint- stock companies as a factor affecting the performance by a joint-stock company of its obligation to provide information to shareholders should be fully welcomed. However, the legal and technical design of the corresponding political and legal idea cannot be considered optimal. In this part, the legislation requires a complete renovation based on the principle of balancing constitutional values and the interests of the state, majority and minority shareholders.
   Description of research methodology. The research is based on a systematic analysis, as well as the interpretation of Russian legislation and doctrine.
   Information about the main scientific results. The development of legislation on joint-stock companies in terms of providing information is shown. It is shown that if legislator taking into account sanctions when regulating the obligation of a joint-stock company to provide information, the goals of legislative regulation fully comply with constitutional principles, but specific legal decisions cannot be considered optimal. Conclusions. It is concluded that development of legislation on joint-stock companies has led to a significant restriction of the ability of shareholders to receive information. The author formulated the priority of regulatory goals in countering sanctions pressure and offered specific directions for improving legal regulation.

AB This article explores the features of the implementation of individual parliamentary rights by members of the Federation Council, the upper house of the Russian legislative assembly. The relevance of the study is since in recent years there has been a transformation in informal practices of political influence on parliamentarians. In this sense, the object of the study was the analysis of individual legal norms, the regulations of the Federation Council and the practice of holding parliamentary hearings. The authors focused on the negative consequences expressing the responsibility of senators, considering the ambiguous statutory regulation of such measures in modern Russian politics. During the development of the scope of activities carried out by the upper house of the Federal Assembly, the reasons by which its members could lose their powers were significantly expanded. By way of conclusion, it was noted that, despite the rarity of the application of such sanctions, the authors recorded a systematization of forms and measures of responsibility used for political purposes. Such tendencies create artificial barriers to the implementation of certain senatorial powers and acquire a political character.

DE Nyintso-gonpa; Tibetan Buddhist monastery; Eastern Tibet; Hor states
AB The Nyitso-gonpa monastery is one of the Thirteen Hor monasteries of Kham. It is located in the town of Xiangshui, Tau county (Chin. Daofu), Kandze Tibet Autonomous Prefecture (Chin. Ganzi), Sichuan Province. The Hor region was one of the traditional Kham polities. Historically the Nyitso-gonpa monastery had great influence in it, not only in religious, but also in political and economic spheres, exercising political power in the region in close relationship with secular rulers. Yet, the separation of religion from the state, executed during the 1956 'democratic reforms' and the 'cultural revolution' in 1966-1967, undermined the subsistence of the monastery, and it practically ceased to exist. In turn, the full-scale reforms promoted after the death of Mao Zedong stimulated its blooming revival and restoration of its former functions in the local society.
   Since the topic is poorly investigated in Tibetan and Chinese Studies, the main task of the article was to present the phenomenon of Hor and the Nyitso-gonpa in its historical perspective and present stage in the context of the Mongol-Tibetan and Sino-Tibetan relationships in Kham. The principal trajectory of research and the main conclusions are the following: The history of Hor goes back to the 13th century and is connected with the conquest of Tibet by the Mongols of Genghis Khan. By the 17th century representatives of the Hor clan have become the secular leaders of the local population, the Five Hor states were established, and the Thirteen Hor monasteries of the Gelugpa order had emerged. During the Qing reign, the Hor states fell under the nominal control of the empire, but were in fact autonomously ruled by their secular chiefs and monasteries. At the end of the Qing dynasty, Beijing gained, for a short time, full control over the region, which, however, was again lost during the period of the Republic of China. Since those times the Hor states along with Nyarong and Derge have been a disputed object in the Sino-Tibetan conflict, but by balancing between these two centers of power, could maintain their autonomy until the communists' victory in China and the establishment of the PRC. During the period of its incorporation into China the region has undergone tremendous changes, from the total destruction of all traditional institutions to the restoration of religion and the monastic system. Using the example of the Nyitso-gonpa, one can see both the transformation of the Tibetan monastic system and its role in the Sino-Tibetan borderlands at the present time. Constituting still the core of traditional Tibetan politics and identity the Tibetan monastic system not only ensure the preservation and continuity of Tibetan culture and lifestyle, but also restore its own social functions and, moreover, make a significant impact on the local political agenda.

AB Introduction. The article is devoted to the analysis of the protest political mobilization in the regional political space of Volgograd region. Particular attention is paid to the study of the main conditions and causes of protest activity in the context of implementing public policy in Volgograd region. The relevance of the problem field is due to the need for a political analysis of the characteristics of the population mobilization at the regional level, including their comparison with federal trends. Methodology and methods. The authors conceptualize political mobilization on the basis of the theoretical principles of the theory of collective behavior of G. Blumer, E. Hoffer, T. Garr and the rational basis for the mobilization of D. Gupt. The methodological basis of the study is the theory of collective action (Ch. Tilly), on the basis of which it is concluded that political mobilization is defined as a combination of institutional and social conditions that allow actors to rationally evaluate transaction costs and possible gains from mobilization actions. The analysis of the regional public policy system is based on the conclusions contained in the works of Yu.O. Gaivoronsky, S.I. Morozov, S.A. Pankratov. The empirical basis of the study is the public opinion polls of the Levada Center, expert and analytical materials on the state of protest activity of the Institute of Regional Expertise, as well as the results of monitoring data from Internet resources obtained with the direct participation of the authors in March 2020. Analysis. The modern Russian socio-political system is a synthesis of two opposites: a hermetically "closed" institutional political structure, which is determined by the situation of internal uncertainty, and an active social component. At the same time, the specifics of the regional public space of Volgograd Region is a combination of the subject composition of the institutional design of the regional political regime based on copying the features of the federal regime, as well as the diversity of the regional themes of socio-political protest. Based on the results obtained by the case-study method, it was found that the protest dynamics in Volgograd region show a downward trend, however, any manifestations of public protest activity in the region implicitly imply a political nature in direct proportion to the number of participants: the greater the number of participants in the protest stocks, the higher the degree of its politicization. Results. According to the results of the study, it was revealed that the protest political mobilization in the public space of Volgograd region is characterized by: firstly, the prevalence of regional problems over federal ones in the protest discourse; secondly, the lack of strong institutional structures that can mobilize material and organizational resources; thirdly, a critically low number of protesters; fourthly, the spontaneous nature of mobilization. A special feature of political mobilization in the regional dimension is the low social potential of the protest and the lack of effective mechanisms for political and communicative interaction between government institutions and the population of Volgograd region on a specific range of problems of a public nature. In order to overcome the shortcomings of dialogue communication, within the framework of representative democracy, the authors propose recommendations for the main actors of the public political space (regional authorities, expert community and civil society institutions).

DT Article
DE political journalism; I.M. Grevs; Russian Medieval Studies; Liberalism;
   Cadet Party; Russian Revolution
AB The article attempts to consider the political journalism of the famous Russian medieval historian, professor of the Imperial St. Petersburg University, Ivan Grevs, as a form of legitimization of the academic discipline "general history" in the public space of the Russian Empire. Ivan Grevs' political journalism, practically, has never before become the subject of special analysis either in works devoted to the history of Russian liberalism, or in works devoted directly to the historian himself. We managed to identify more than 30 Grevs' articles on politics and published in the liberal periodicals "Rech", "Pravo", "Polyarnaya Zvezda", "Svoboda i Cultura" from 1905 to 1918. These articles were used as the main source in our research. At the same time, two peaks of Grevs' publication activity can be chronologically revealed. These are 1905-1906 (13 articles) and 1917-1918 (15 articles). Articles of these two periods differ thematically. Grevs criticized state policy in the field of higher education and tried to justify the political program of the Cadet Party in 1905-1906. In 1917-1918, the subjects of his articles were much more diverse, but at the same time, they clearly contain criticism of the Bolsheviks. During the study, we came to the conclusion that there is an "ideological" and discursive similarity between the political journalistic and professional, academic (scientific and popular science) works of Ivan Grevs. The historian analyzed contemporary processes in education, science, state, party life through the prism of humanism, historical idealism, the "genetic" principle, cultural and historical progress, and continuity. Universal human culture and values, personal freedom, individuality, progress, faith in unity, etc. - that all filled the space of Grevs' journalistic texts no less than professional academic ones. At the same time, professional scientific texts, or rather symbolic capital that exists due to them, perform the function of implicit argumentation within the framework of the communication regime chosen by Grevs. The reader "must believe" the author, also because the author is a "professor". If this turns out to be insufficient, the reader can check with the author's scientific works and find in them a detailed substantiation of the position outlined in the journalistic articles. The communication strategy chosen by Grevs suggests that, on the one hand, the academic historian can position himself in public space as a competent expert in analyzing current political processes, and on the other hand, his journalistic activity is an effective way to legitimize professional academic activity.

AB The article is focused on new understanding of Modernity as a synthesis of civil/structural and religious/nonstructural forms of communality. Civil and religious types of community are considered as two basic components of modern sociality, cyclically supporting and replacing each other as the social space expands and new civilizational segments are included in it. Based on the work of a number of researchers, the author hypothesizes that at the present stage the crisis of Modernity is connected with the limits of existing forms of civic/structural communication in providing a real connection and inclusion of different cultures and societies on modern stage of Globalization. The development of new nonstructural emotional forms of social identification, based on compassion could prevent split of global community and prepare global social space for another step of civic/structural integration.

AB Analysis of political cartoons as multimodal metaphors requires a complex set of methods and techniques to be incorporated into a research project. We believe that network analysis could help to explore the explicit and implicit meanings of this type of text, especially in a case of drawings based on world politics topics. To introduce our approach to building networks from visual metaphors and to demonstrate essential issues connected with its coding we have taken cartoons created by Kevin 'KAL' Kallaugher, one of the premier modern caricaturists. In this paper, our data consist of 50 images published in 2018 in The Economist's special section "The World this Week," which is dedicated to the most important events in global affairs. The main aim of our paper was to show a research design that allows us to turn pictures of political leaders into a multilayer international relations network inconspicuously drawn by an artist frame by frame within a year. We have also found that the use of multiplex networks allows to capture patterns of interactions in a very explicit manner and brings many benefits to qualitative research that deals with specific issues, such as Brexit or Eurocentrism.

AB The article is devoted to the study of the creation and development of a brand with national specifics in the modern Tibet Autonomous region on the example of the villages of the national minorities of Menba and Loba. The main regulatory and legal acts that state the need for the production of the above-mentioned type of products are considered. In modern China, the formation of a brand with national specifics is one of the main tools for the economic development of national regions, which was mentioned in "The plan of promotion of the development of national regions and relatively small national minorities [within] the 13th five-year plan" (2016).
   Creating a brand with national specifics in China is closely related to traditional crafts, artistic crafts of national minorities living in territories that occupy about 64 % of the area of China. Which products of traditional crafts undergo transformation and become a modern brand with national specifics in a particular territory is of interest for research in the field of Economics, Anthropology, Ethnography, History and other scientific fields. The article provides examples of products of the most famous local brands with national specifics, produced in the villages of Menba and LobA. The article emphasizes that there is no complete correspondence between the "ethnic brands" of the past and the present. The article analyzes the main sources of creating a brand with national specifics in modern Tibet: local natural resources; products traditionally imported to China from Tibet throughout history; products created by Tibetans for local consumption. The economic effect of the development of enterprises that produce products of brands with national specifics is considered.
   The author of the article raises the question - what factors do influence the formation of a brand with national specifics in Tibet? What does the concept itself include? The article presents various forms of implementation of the brand concept with national specifics: from traditional ethnic household items to the creation of entire villages with national specifics. In addition, the paper deals with the topic of product contact with a geographical indicator and a brand with national specifics.

DT Article
DE political theory; international relations theory; political philosophy;
   language; practice; John Gunnell; Ludwig Wittgenstein
AB This review was prompted by the publication of John Gunnell's latest book, "Conventional Realism and Political Inquiry: Channeling Wittgenstein." (Chicago, London: The University of Chicago Press, 2020). Theoretically and methodologically, his approach develops the popular current agenda of practical and linguistic turns, and also illustrates well its drawbacks. The review aims to identify the contribution of Gunnell's work and problems in this context. We fulfilled three objectives - reviewing the book's main ideas; its particular shortcomings; and the problems representative of the aforementioned broad topic. The first two objectives are fulfilled in parallel, followed by the third. Drawing on Ludwig Wittgenstein's ideas, Gunnell unfolds his position of 'conventional realism' as applied to politics. Gunnell systematically showed that politics largely resides in human collective linguistic practices, which are plural and changeable. They cannot be reduced to any dogmatic paradigm abusing the rhetoric of metaphysics, 'the natural', or 'science' to justify a specific policy. The making of multiple practices and their change manifest humanity's collective creative freedom; it also implies their responsibility. However, we note the vulnerability of the general idea, which overstates the unity of thinking and language. Three closely related, representative problems directly concerning politics are shown. The first and broadest one is a combination of trivialness and relativism. It is not clear enough how to compare different practices and grasp relations between them, and the risks remain of reifying the social 'given' or trivially noting an arbitrary 'switch' between 'givens'; more attention should be paid to conceptions of rationality that are critical, and neither relativist nor dogmatic. The second problem lies in lessening the role of philosophy and political science in a rational and critical assessment of political practices. The third issue is that Gunnell himself firstly criticised the grounding of practices by scholars, but then largely made the same mistake himself by defending the normative benchmark of democracy.

AB The relevance of the study is due to the increased scientific and practical interest in the particularities of representing various socio-political processes characteristic of globalized reality, as well as the use of linguistic and extralinguistic resources for politically beneficial manipulations, instilling certain norms and stereotypes, and rethinking existing realities, including designing an attractive or, conversely, repulsive image of a country. In this regard, the issue of ambiguous media image presentation of Russia in the international arena deserves special attention. The purpose of the study is to identify the main linguistic mechanisms by which a negative, neutral or positive tone of messages about Russia and determining its political rating in the Iberoamerican mass media is formed (2017-2019). The study analyzes the specifics of the selection and combination of language techniques (evaluative vocabulary, various stylistic and rhetorical figures, political terms and cliches), as well as the features of their application in the framework of special manipulative strategies and tactics (selection of information, filtering, overload and amortization, labeling, falsification, solidarity and opposition, the ideology of "post-truth", the phenomenon of "politainment", theatricality and "visualization" of political discourse, etc.). The interdisciplinary nature of the study involves both the use of methods of the linguistic analysis proper (structural-semantic, descriptive-analytical, contextual and stylistic), and methods of related sciences (linguocognitive, linguopragmatic, linguocultural, linguopolitical, etc.). The results obtained during the study allow us to clearly demonstrate how the choice of a strategic vector contributes to the popularization or discrediting the country's political image.

AB Introduction. The article is focused on reconstruction of the practices of forming a disciplinary group of classical philologists in the Russian Empire universities in the 1830s - 1850s. Methods. For this purpose, the archival materials of the Ministry of Education, as well as Saint Petersburg, Moscow, Kazan and Kiev Universities are considered. The research methodology is based on a combination of both traditional general historical methods and methods of classical source studies, and approaches developed in the framework of the history of science, the sociology of knowledge and the history of disciplines. Analysis and results. It is important to analyze three points: the political context, practices in building career trajectories and academic networks of professors of Greek and Roman literature and antiquities at Russian universities. The transformation of the existing network of universities into the system of public education was carried out by the Minister of Public Education Sergey Uvarov in the 1830s. Transferring to Russia the European model of secondary education based on the study of classical languages, Uvarov created a system of general education and relentlessly promoted antiquity studies in the Russian Empire. Teaching classical disciplines was expanded at gymnasiums and universities. Following the academic personnel reform of the late 1830s, a number of "antiquity chairs" at universities was headed by young philologists and historians who had spent two or three years of training at universities in Germany, mainly in Berlin, attending lectures and seminars of leading German classical philologists. In the 1840s - 1850s, an artificially constructed group of classical philologists gradually transformed into a disciplinary community.

DT Editorial Material
DE President; Address to Federal Assembly; National Security Strategy; RF
   Constitution; transit of power
AB In January of 2020, Russian President V. V. Putin delivered an annual Address to the Federal Assembly and announced a number of significant proposals in order to change the Constitution of the Russian Federation. There were broad discussions about the proposed amendments and changes of the entire Russian political system, internal and external aspects of public administration, which they entail, in the socio-political space. This article presents the author's view on this issue. The researchers analyze V. Putin's main historical steps, which have been determining the vector of the development of post-Soviet statehood over the past 20 years. The authors review the President's program articles, his public speeches, public meetings, his key decisions in foreign and domestic policy, strategic system documents, etc. The authors conclude that V. Putin has been consistently building the framework of a new Russian statehood throughout all his presidential terms. He publicly and extensively described the contours of this system in his first program article "Russia at the Turn of the Millennium" (1999). The article also includes the analysis of expert evaluations of the motives of the 2020 Presidential Address; the examination of the implementation of national projects and the National Security Strategy, for which V. Putin took personal responsibility in 2015; statistical data, describing the state of affairs in the areas of demography and health, science and education, economic growth and population's quality of life over the past 30 years. The results of the study allow us to say that the President's initiatives, aimed at the transformation of the country's entire political system, are largely forced. It is a necessary condition for the completion of the goal, set by him in 1999, until the end of his presidential term, limited by the current Constitution of the Russian Federation - the creation of a strong, independent social state with a stable political system, which effectively adapts to internal and external challenges.

AB Over the last 10 years, the journal "Economic and Social Changes: Facts, Trends, Forecast" has been presenting articles on relevant problems of Russian society and government in its "Editorial" section once in every two months. Based on expert opinions of a wide range of scientists, sociologists, economists, political and social activists, and a set of factual data, acquired using sociological and statistical tools, a long-term monitoring of the public administration efficiency has been conducted, which allowed assessing the current situation in the country in real time. In Editor-in-Chief's previous article, published in the journal "Economic and Social Changes: Facts, Trends, Forecast" no.4, we focused on the results of the all-Russian vote on amendments to the Constitution of the Russian Federation, held on July 1, 2020. Amended Constitution significantly strengthens social obligations of the government, and it is aimed at the protection of Russia's national interests. Besides, the nature of the new Constitution turned out to be relevant in terms of civilizational challenges, because common practice of border shutdowns during COVID-19 epidemic forms new outlines of the world order that strengthen a value of national interests and weaken globalization values, which have been dominant over the last 50 years. Nethertheless, many experts noted after the all-Russian vote that the consolidation of society around constitutional amendments did not work out. The results of our analysis, conducted according to data of the Central Election Commission of the Russian Federation, showed that the share of people, who voted against amendments, exceeded average national numbers in 47 Russian regions out of 86; it was even higher in some oblast centers. Its main reason is people's disbelief in a desire and abilities of the ruling elites to implement election promises of the President. This situation is primarily caused by a lack of noticeable positive changes in the dynamics of the level and quality of life in the last ten years. In order to enhance this topic, we decided to analyze some key aspects of the whole process of the formation of the new post-Soviet statehood. The President himself initiated and publically announced this reform back in 1999, and he has been controlling its implementation ever since.

AB The article is the final part of the series of publications "From the Editor-in-Chief", published in 2020 in the journal "Economic and Social Changes: Facts, Trends, Forecast". Its central problem is the unsatisfactory quality of the ruling elites in Russia which, for almost the entire post-Soviet period, has been the main problem of stalling reforms and achievement of national development goals. The authors analyze the causes of this phenomenon; provide expert assessments and statistical data that allow us to assess the current state of the ruling elites in the country. The article examines the trends of public sentiment as an indicator of the negative consequences of the public administration inefficiency and the unrealization of social expectations from the government and from the President personally. We pay special attention to the content and results of the anti-corruption campaign initiated by the President of the Russian Federation in the mid-2010s. For this purpose, we analyze data of monthly reports of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation on the state of crime in the Russian Federation for the period from 2003 to October 2020, statistics of the Judicial Department at the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation on the state of criminal records in Russia for the period from 2012 to the first half of 2020, materials of mass media, and opinions of experts. The authors come to the conclusion that it is necessary to move from episodic, or "demonstrative", criminal cases with a common motive being an internal political processes to systematic preventive work on the nationalization of the ruling elites. Its purpose is not to maintain a balance of interests within the elite groups but to solve the key tasks of national development: achieving social justice, reducing inequality, dynamic growth in the level of income and quality of life of the population. This approach mostly corresponds to the new socially oriented Constitution of 2020, and, ultimately, it allows hoping for the solution of many problems in the system of state administration, as well as for the development of Russian statehood in the civilizational and historical context.

Kilin, which focuses on the topic of private trade under the NEP and considers it in a wider chronological context. The monograph analyses the NEP as a model of managing and regulating the economy, trade, and commodity turnover in the Urals. It also considers private trade as an object of state control, the credit system, social aspects of private enterprise under the NEP and the trading and intermediary activities of workers. The monograph provides a heterogeneous picture which enables the reader to gain a comprehensive idea of the NEP and the place private trade occupied in it. Of crucial historiographic importance is the author's conclusion that private trade was an organic part of the mixed economy's structure under the NEP and served to connect the producer, the consumer, different spheres of economy and economic setups.

One of the leading national and confessional forces in the late Imperial period in Russia were the Muslim Turks of the Volga-Ural region. After the February revolution, the goals of the national movement became the creation of religious and national-cultural autonomy, ensuring the official status of the Tatar language.

AB In IR studies into the most prominent patterns of how great powers conduct themselves under anarchy, a special emphasis is placed on the concepts of great power, dominance, and hegemony. However, concrete manifestations of these phenomena, as well as applied tools through which leading international players seek to structure the international environment, often remain outside the scope of detailed investigation. This study aims to appraise the significance of asymmetric alliances, as a tool of military and political dominance in the toollkit of power politics. The article shows that, although the traditional capabilities of appliances' aggregation function in large part lost their value after the Second World War as part of the bipolar structure of the international power balance asymmetric alliances still became firmly woven into the practices of American dominance - this time as a mechanism for the consolidation of U.S. hegemony. They assured control over a select group of privileged partners in key regions of the world and helped advance the power projection of the United States. Currently, alternative centers of power aspire to delegitimize this mechanism of military-political interaction, denouncing it as a tool for subordinating weaker states, contrasting them with the egalitarian nature of inclusive dialogue formats. The USA itself is, too, often burdened by the institutional constraints of allied relations, questioning their relevance on, above all, operational considerations. Against this background, the significance of asymmetric; alliances in international politics may decline in the coming decades, following the weakening of the hegemony they were originally designed to shore up; this will require creativity on the part of rising powers, who will be in need of new institutional mechanisms to back up their regional, and possibly global, hegemony.

AB The article is devoted to the heritage of the Roerich family - Nikolai Konstantinovich, Elena Ivanovna, Yuri Nikolaevich, Svyatoslav Nikolaevich, and its role in the current situation of world crisis, especially for the Eurasian geopolitical space. The authors substantiate the thesis that the political and cultural views of the Roerich family matured parallel to the movement of the Eurasians and in a number of aspects specify many their ideas. The authors reveal and explore the relevance and predictability of the key principles held by the Roerich family concerning the perspectives of Russia and the areas of Eurasian cooperation. In the legacy of the Roerich family, the main features of the impending global crisis are described in a visionary way. They saw a way out of the crisis in establishing the primacy of culture over economy, the primacy of the spiritual over the material. The Roerichs warned of the dangers of a barbaric relationship with nature, robotization and decomposition of consciousness. Their warnings about the dangers of a mechanical civilization are confirmed in the work of modern analysts. According to Roerichs, the ideal of cooperation and cooperation should become the basis of relations between peoples. The Roerichs emphasized the special importance of the Russian-Mongolian and Russian-Indian ties forming a geopolitical and spiritual "middle cross" of Eurasia. The commonality of the environmental, cultural and economic problems of the two great mountain regions of the Earth is a solid foundation for future cooperation between scientists in the space of Eurasia.

DT Article
DE Cold War; regional conflict; US Foreign Policy; Soviet threat; Greece;
   Yugoslavia; Turkey; NATO; Balkan Pact of 1953
AB The article examines the actions of the US diplomacy aimed at strengthening the US military and political presence in the Balkans and the Eastern Mediterranean in the first half of the 1950s. The United States began creating mechanisms for mobilizing its allies to contain possible Soviet aggression in the event of a new local conflict on the Balkan Peninsula. This policy led to the need to develop plans for internationalization of alleged conflict. The author uses materials from the US National Archives, the State Archive of the Russian Federation, the electronic archives of the Central Intelligence Agency, North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the US National Security Council, as well as published sources. Special attention is paid to the position of the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff on military strategy in the Eastern Mediterranean. The outbreak of the Korean War became an important milestone in American politics not only for the Far East, but also for other regions of the world. In the Balkans, the Americans were mostly afraid of the aggression of Soviet "satellites" against Greece and Yugoslavia. In response, in the early 1950s the United States formed a new security model in the Balkans, which based on a differentiated approach: Greece became a member of NATO, while Yugoslavia entered the anti-Soviet Balkan Pact affiliated with NATO. Yugoslavia became a bridge between the NATO countries - Italy and Greece. Documents held in the US National Archives show that American military leaders spoke out in favor of Yugoslavia's membership in NATO and insisted on coordinating the military plans of Italy, Yugoslavia, Greece and Turkey. The author concludes that the rapprochement of Yugoslavia, Greece and Turkey was situational. The improvement of the situation in the Balkans after the death of Joseph Stalin led to the collapse of the Balkan Pact. The analysis of American policy in the Balkans made it possible to contribute to the study of the means and methods used by the United States to internationalize military conflicts in various regions of the world in the mid-twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.

AB Introduction: the cluster of alphabetical editions has its own history. In their formation, the socio-political and cultural aspects of time played an important role. In this context, the Udmurt alphabet compiled by N. N. Blinov was also created. The considered monument of Udmurt literature is interesting as the material for study and analysis from the point of view of the presence in it of historical and methodological materials, the formation of the idea about letter reform and development of literary genres. In this key alphabet by N. N. Blinov has never been considered before.
   Objective: to consider N. N. Blinov's alphabet in the context of educational and methodical principles, formation of written and literary traditions of the XIX-XX centuries.
   Research materials: Udmurt alphabet by N. N. Blinov "Lydzon" ("Reading") (1867).
   Results and novelty of the research: the paper substantiates the idea about the typological similarity of the textbooks of the XIX-XX centuries, explainable by the fact that the texts were borrowed from existing books, subject to creative processing. Works of Russian writers placed in the content of the textbook paved the way for interethnic communication practices, literary experiments in native language. In general, the new teaching algorithm proposed by N. N. Blinov was predetermined by the sociocultural context and was later used by other compilers of textbooks for Udmurt children.
   The Udmurt alphabet by N. N. Blinov, characterized by methodological innovations, was first considered in the context of the educational and methodological principles of teaching and written literary traditions that were formed in the XIX-XX centuries.

DT Article
DE fascist occupation; Ostland; Lithuania; Latvia; Estonia; SS legions;

AB In many ways, the perception and comprehension of the Second World War form the basis for the historical self-identification of several generations. They are also a sphere of political manipulation. For instance, in the Baltic states, the Nazi occupation, interpreted as a means of "the liberation from the Soviets", is a widespread ideologeme. Participation in military activities or service in the rear divisions under the swastika flag are interpreted as a "struggle for independence" there. Reference to archival documents about the actual plans, methods, and results of the leaders of the Third Reich as related to the Baltic states and their titular nations makes it possible to study the events that took place in the region between 1941 and 1944. The author refers to a collection of materials of the operational headquarters of Reichsleiter Rosenberg in Riga kept in the Latvian State Historical Archive (Latvijas Valsts Vestures arhivs), the documents of the "Riga Trial" kept the Central Archive of the FSB of Russia, and the most recent historiography. Special attention is paid to the actual plans of the Reich leaders concerning the process of granting Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia independence, the functioning of self-government, and the actions of the occupational authorities towards the national languages, cultures, and education of the "unpromising nations", i. e. Lithuanians, Latvians, and Estonians. The article also examines the establishment of SS formations and other military units made up by representatives of the Baltic peoples and the economic aspects of Nazi policy in "Ostland".

TI ON DEMOCRATIC FETISHISM
SO LOGOS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE democracy; crisis; political culture; elitism; fetishism
AB A sizeable section of American public opinion along with that of many political scientists have interpreted Donald Trump's victory in 2016 as a token of a profound crisis in democracy, or of an ongoing and dangerous deepening of that crisis. The urge to fathom the nature of this (supposed) crisis and to find ways to overcome it has resulted in a substantial rethinking of some of the mainstays of the conventional democratic theory that has been dominant until recently. This article scrutinizes and assesses these recent and ongoing metamorphoses in mainstream democratic theory by focusing primarily on How Democracies Die by Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt, which has been much praised by Trump's opponents. The paper argues that these theoretical metamorphoses are still taking place within the ambit of the elitist political culture and are perhaps even augmenting its characteristic features.
   The nature and the logic of this avowedly elitist response to Trump's populist challenge call for a thorough investigation, but theories of political culture are inadequate to grapple with this problem. Instead, the author suggests turning to the fundamental categories of fetish and fetishism and constructing the concepts of political fetishism and democratic fetishism as derivatives from them. The author borrows certain elements of the concept of democratic fetishism from Alain Badiou, who has recently elaborated and popularized it. There are, however, at least two departures from Badiou's account. First, although Badiou sees democratic fetishism as an apolitical degeneration of politics, it is not here interpreted as a completely negative factor in current politics. Second, the author makes a distinction between popular democratic fetishism and its elite version and finds that the "fate of democracy" now depends heavily (especially in the West) upon the nature and dynamics the interactions between them.

AB Political hermeneutics is a relatively new trend in the development of philosophic, philological, political and elitological science characterized as an interdisciplinary direction, with all typical features. The attention of political hermeneutics is aimed primarily at the analysis of the text-culture produced by the political elites and their leaders, revealing the meanings and symbols that contain their words and deeds. Special attention is paid to the issue of verification of political text, criticism and exposure of political disinformation and falsification of history. Political hermeneutics measures the weight of the word subject uttered by the elite and through the analysis of the quality, reveals the level of quality of the elite, weight measure of its authority, responsibility and professionalism. For elitological political science hermeneutics serves an important method for studying the intrinsic qualities of the elite (its eliteness), opening up the opportunity to penetrate the depths of the individual personalistic of the politician, establish dialectical links of the text of the elite with its historical context and psychological overtones. This more "dense work" with the subject of the elite allows us to give a more adequate diagnosis of its current state, to overcome subjectivism apology, evaluate its professional capabilities and resources of hidden power objectively.

   of life
AB The study of the reception of Tolstoy's teaching in Japan is of interest both in terms of the history, opportunities, and prospects of intercultural communication, consideration of ways to strengthen mutual understanding between the two countries, and in terms of the determination of the importance of certain ideas of domestic thought through their impact on the consciousness of people in different parts of the world as a whole.
   The article overviews the history of the initial stages of perception and influence of Leo Tolstoy's teaching. The main channels of its transmission and dissemination are traced and the reasons for its popularity in Japan are investigated. Among them, it is possible to single out such reasons as this teaching's practical orientation and humanistic nature, its consonance with the Buddhist worldview in a number of aspects, the philosophy of pacifism and non-resistance, ecumenism, idealization and ethization of agricultural work in harmony with nature, reflections on the humanitarian problems of progress. The author's analysis is focused upon the ways of rethinking and applying Tolstoy's concepts by contemporary Japanese humanities thinkers in their search for approaches to solving the civilizational, political, sociocultural, humanitarian problems of the 21st century. The subject of special attention is the incorporation of Tolstoy's ideas by modern Japanese Buddhist thinkers, in particular, Ikeda Daisaku, as well as comparative studies of Tolstoy's major philosophical concepts and key doctrines of the Japanese Buddhist tradition. The issue of particular interest is the appeal to the Russian thinker's spiritual heritage in the Japanese pacifist discourse in line with the present-day debate regarding the future of the peace clause of the Japanese Constitution and Japan's determination of its new role in the world. The article is the first attempt to generalize views on Tolstoy's heritage and its assessments in contemporary Japan in recent decades. The author aims to complement significantly the existing knowledge about the interpretation of Tolstoy's thought abroad, thanks to the determination of the spectrum of problems for which the resource of Russian philosophy is being used today and the identification of ways and forms of perception of its ideas.

TI ON SOME PROBLEMS ON INTERPRETATION OF THE IMAGE OF GOD SETH IN THE EARLY
   DYNASTIC PERIOD
SO VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA ISTORIYA-TOMSK STATE
   UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HISTORY
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Seth; Seth-Ra; solar; Ombos; Peribsen; title; Khasekhemwy
AB The article discusses the evolution of the cult of god Seth in Predynastic and Early Dynastic Period that is reflected by royal seals, stamps of seals, vessels, and reliefs. Primarily the name of Seth appears in the queens' titles during the reign of the First dynasty. During the reign of king Den, who ruled in the middle of the Frst dynasty, it was first mentioned that Seth was connected with Ombos. It was the Upper Egyptian city and cult center of Seth, where he was worshiped and with whom Seth was closely associated in almost all periods of ancient Egyptian history. During the Second dynasty, in the reign of Peribsen, the cult of Seth was continues to be honored in Ombos, and Seth got the status of the main god of this center in Upper Egypt. In author's opinion this process was accompanied by changing royal titles where Seth factually begun to be associated with the solar god. This hypothesis can be proved by the serekh of Peribsen with Seth accompanied by the sun disk. Religious and ideological doctrine introduced by Peribsen played a key role in further development of the Seth's cult in Egypt. Peribsen promoted Seth as a patron god, replacing them with god Horus, revered by the preceding kings. This could be due to a military conflict or the disintegration of Egypt into two parts, since Peribsen, ruling in southern Egypt, made military campaigns in Lower Egypt with the aim of uniting the country. An analysis of the monuments showed that Peribsen pursued an conquest policy in Lower Egypt, which is indicated by the toponyms %Tt and &A-mHw. Under the last king of the Second dynasty Khasekhemwy Seth became the god who patronized royal power along with Horus. This could be due to the fact that Khasekhemwy was able to reunite the two parts of Egypt, which in the reign of Peribsen were not a single state. The symbol of this unification of the country was the premises of Horus and Seth in the double crowns of Egypt over the serekh of Khasehemwy. During the reign of Djoser, being the first pharaoh of the Third dynasty, the cult of Seth continued to be one of the main cults of the ruling dynasty maintaining in Heliopolis. Thus, the connection of Seth with royal power can be traced throughout the Early Dynastic Period. As the monuments show, the cult of Seth has acquired important political significance since the late Predynastic Period. In the future, his political role increased and during the reign of the first three Egyptian dynasties, the cult of Seth played an important role in substantiating of royal power.

TI ANALYSIS OF DISCUSSIONS WITHIN THE CHINESE SOCIETY ON CHINA'S POSITION

DT Article
DE coronavirus pandemic; foreign policy discussions within Chinese society;
   May 4th Movement; values and historical memory in Chinese society;
   Chinese foreign policy; Sino-American relations
AB During the pandemic, Sino-US relations have remarkably deteriorated. The institutionalization of such destructive practices as toughening rhetoric in the media and sanctions is becoming obvious. As the model of bilateral relations is now aimed at decoupling the degradation will continue. These trends inevitably affect the mood of the Chinese society. The article analyzes opinions on foreign policy in Chinese society in the context of Sino-American relations within the pandemic period. The work is divided into two parts: the first assesses general trends in US-China relations. The second part traces the current trends in the modem ideological and political atmosphere in Chinese society. The episode with congratulations to the Chinese public from the American administration on the occasion of the 101st anniversary of the famous "May 4, 1919 movements" is analyzed as a case study. The research shows that this event received ambiguous and even opposite assessments: part of the society saw in it as an attempt to accuse China of the spread of coronavirus and the imposition of Western values. Another part emphasized M. Pottinger's rather high level of spoken Chinese and noted that the very fact of congratulation can be viewed as a positive moment for bilateral relations. There were also positions combining both approaches. Tire case under consideration reveals the danger of decoupling initiated by the parties. The tension between the PRC and the United States leads to the Net that the partners are starting to interpret each other's intentions as presumably hostile, even taking into account such a formally favorable occasion as congratulations on a significant historical date. Meanwhile, it seems that the presence of positive interpretations against the background of a general deterioration in bilateral relations also cannot be ignored. Although public opinion cannot he unambiguous and does not always directly influence specific political steps. it is important to take into account the full range of opinions for an objective and comprehensive analysis of Sino-American relations.

TI SOVIET HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ARCTIC IN THE
   MIRROR OF CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS

   UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HISTORY
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Arctic; strategy; state; business; science
AB The purpose of the article is to compare the modern and soviet experience of the development of the Russian Arctic zone (AZ). The tasks of the article are to find out: 1) why the policy of development of the AZ turned out in the captivity of situational decisions? 2) how can the soviet experience of developing the AZ be useful? 3) where bottlenecks in the development and implementation of modern strategies in the AZ?
   The tasks are solved within the framework of the modernization and mobilization conceptual approaches, related to the dynamics and features of the all-Russian development. If the interrelation between the political, economic and social components of the development of the North is broken, the systemic links are broken, which leads to fragmentary modernization.
   The source base is the corpus of documents, related to the activities of the government, regional state bodies and scientific organizations on the development of the AZ. The materials of the periodicals and unpublished documents from the Tyumen archives are used.
   Conclusions of the article: 1) the industrial framework of the Russian Arctic today is made up of territorial-production complexes, created in the USSR. They were formed in accordance with the "General schemes for the development and deployment of the productive forces of the country and its regions"; 2) in the post-soviet period, the infrastructure of the Arctic turned out to be thoroughly destroyed, the number of settlements decreased by a third, the total population of the Russian Arctic was halved; 3) in the absence of a long-term program for the deployment of productive forces in the AZ, the government's decisions to allocate state funds will be dictated not so much by economic considerations and prospects as by political motives and immediate interests; 4) the institution of public-private partnership cannot yet be called effective: a) the state and private companies have their own interests and plans, and the government does not know how to balance them; b) the business does not trust the state, whose decisions are not transparent and there are no state guarantees of business security; c) private companies are engaged not in the development of the territory, but in the exploitation of rich deposits, more in their own interests than in the interests of the AZ, the country and the population. Without effective cooperation of the state, production and science within the framework of the long-term program for the development of regions, it is impossible to ensure the necessary result in the Arctic.

AB A special review on Global Governance and Strategic Mutual Trust was published in the final issue of the journal "Social Sciences in China" dated November 2018. The main feature of this material is that it scientifically explores some of the newest approaches of a group of prominent scholars of the PRC to a set of issues related to the genesis of the "new model of global governance" in the context of the onset of the "new era of globalization", "new globalization", etc. in response to phenomena, processes and trends of "deglobalization" and "antiglobalization".
   At the same time, some Chinese experts, including those authoring this review, claim the vision of almost "a new end of world history" in the form of the triumph of the initiatives of the "One Belt, One Road", "Community of the Single Destiny of Humanity", "International Relationships of a New Type", etc. initiatives proclaimed by the modern leadership of China (PRC) and CPC, evidently, in the spirit of well-known ultra-nationalist ambitions of the "Great China".
   These potentially extremely dangerous conceptual neo-hegemonic illusions (essentially in the spirit of the ideas of the "pax cinica" as, according to some Chinese extremist-minded scholars, the historical alternative to the theory and practice of the "pax america") should be given a timely and adequate theoretical and practical repulse in domestic and world science and practice from the standpoint of the inter-patriotic ideology of the true good in the spirit of "the world truly good idea-dream". Herewith, it's necessary to remember than at least a sizable part of the Earth population in general and of the great Chinese nation in particular bears a notable potential of the true good.

AB Introduction. The authors attempt to trace the evolution of relations between students and superintendents based on archival materials of Pedagogical Institute and St. Petersburg University. Methods. The research is carried out within the framework of the systems approach using historical methods to determine the specifics of the power relations in Russian universities in the first half of the 19th century. Analysis and results. University relationships were changed under the influence of social and political factors, the evolution of the organizational foundations of the university. The relations of students and a superintendent, who was initially chosen from professors, were of a "patriarchal" nature, and the small size of the university community and its isolation from the urban life of Saint Petersburg contributed to the design of a special "family style" of communication. With the increase in the number of students, it becomes necessary to clarify the legal boundaries of student freedom and strengthen police supervision. A detailed system of norms and prohibitions was legislated, and supervision of its implementation was entrusted to a superintendent, who was elected from civilian or military officials. Excessive strengthening of disciplinary supervision of students ended in all sorts of conflicts between students and superintendents.

AB Under the conditions of international economic and political instability, corporate risks exacerbate. Reserve funds and resources in the businesses on the basis of estimated reserves and liabilities are one of the risk management tools, that in their turn have quite a high level of variability as they largely depends on the current accounting policy and a professional opinion of an accountant. This influences significantly the development of financial indicators for commercial organisations, and serves as an additional corporate risk, Among others such as fraud. The conducted research explores the methodological toolkit of internal risk audit that is associated with estimated reserves and liabilities in commercial organisations. Scientific results are aimed at the creation of a corporate identification and control system for corporate risks with the help of estimated reserves and liabilities. Methodological recommendations on accrued expenditure allow to identify risks of inefficient costs, including fraud. The results of the research with empirical materials that were accumulated during the test of internal risk audit method associated with the creation of estimated reserves and liabilities in industrial organisations, audit companies, and in R&D at Plekhanov Russian University of Economics.

AB Impedance coatings of cylindrical bodies' synthesis in order to The authors of the article made an attempt to reveal the main causes and motives of mass collaboration in European countries during the Second World War. Mentally, European man has recognized himself as part of a single space for centuries, under one-man rule: the Roman Empire, the Empire of Charlemagne, and the Holy Roman Empire. The imperial idea initially suggested the European peoples' unification under the auspices of a strong center. The second component of the European mentality was built on the idea of Eurocentrism, proclaiming the superiority of European nations over others, and Western European civilization over the rest of the world. The ruling elite of the German Empire made plans to create "Middle Europe", proclaimed in 1871, which incorporated the economic union of Germany, Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Poland and trimmed France. In 1923, a new idea was published in the manifesto of an Austrian political scientist, Kudenhove-Kalergi - "pan-Europe." The author meant a new, political, single space, spoke about pan-Europe. At the beginning of 1925 the United States of Europe appeared as a more recent idea. These were concrete steps towards creating a united Europe. On the eve of the war years and during that period, leaders and population of European countries were increasingly inclined to take joint actions with Hitler to create a new European device to be able to oppose communist expansion. Mentally, Europe was ready to create a strong core that organized the European space.

   Political Science; EPSA; mass education; mass science; effects of

AB Major international scientific events have their own specifics for their ideological content, methodological tools, methods of organization, and established academic traditions. At the annual conferences of the European Association of Political Science, this specific was in the overwhelming dominance of quantitative research and a strong emphasis on the methodology of research: the method of processing of natural language, and the "difference-in-difference". The analysis of the conference program was a thought-provoking look into the development of domestic and foreign political science, joined by trends of mass education and, consequently, the development of social science under the influence of the principle of "publish or perish". The EPSA conference manifested such common postmodern scientific trends as the fragmentation of scientific knowledge and the lack of "great meanings", democracy and leveling differences and status, humor, and irony. The non-academic (i.e. social) program, which this year was dedicated to diversity, is growing in importance. There was also a focus on Russian themes in political studies by scientists from the USA and Europe, which is reduced to a very narrow range ofproblems - mainly to the criticism of the Russian political regime and the study of the role of new media in the protest mobilization of the masses.

TI Modern political science: Methodology
SO MGIMO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
LA Russian
DT Book Review
DE political science; methodology; world order; resentment; populism;
   identity; demand for dignity; populism
ID RUSSIA
AB The article examines some of the resentment related issues of modern politics, using a number of methodological approaches (identitarian approach, constructivist institutionalism, cultural and civilizational approaches, psychological-political and elitist, as well as gender approaches), described in the collective work of the Russian renowned academics "Modern political science: Methodology". These are the cleavages between traditional politics vs post- and pseudo-politics (shift from the normal politics made by consolidating broad strata to self-centered, exclusive, and increasingly differentiated and closed groups of pseudo-policies), conventional political leadership vs populism and anti-elitism (the rapid growth of populists on a global scale, the spread of anti-establishment sentiment, "populism of power" and the crisis of responsible leadership), formal and informal institutions vs personification of politics (reducing the role of institutions and increasing the importance of the human factor), socio-economic basis of policy vs socio-cultural basis (emphasis on ethnic, religious and gender factors). The resentment as both the cause and effect of identity politics, is a result of an unfair distribution of goods and evils of globalization, or the manifestation of accumulated negative emotions and unjustified expectations. It generalizes these trends and issues and requires new research approaches, since traditional rationalistic approaches based on the theory of rational choice become less effective. To meet the challenges of resentment era, political science should keep balance between rationalism and reflexivity. This balance provides a single epistemological basis for the study of current political reality. It has been successfully reached by the authors of the book "Modern political science: Methodology". The book posits the idea of the fundamental irreducibility of methodology to the sum of the methods. In this regard the volume differs from similar publications aiming to present a wide scope of political methodology. The logic of the representation used by the editors is moving from general to particular, from societal to human, from global to local. The book demonstrates the wide diversity of methodological approaches and the rejection of the ideas of universalism, which adequately characterizes the state of Russian political science. The work is remarkable because it not only reflects, but also structures the Russian political science.

DT Book Review
DE sociotechnical imaginary; imagination; technology; technology policy
AB The reviewed book aims at a more detailed elaboration of the theoretical concept of sociotechnical imaginary. It is a collectively supported, institutionally stabilized, and publicly executed vision of the desired future, inspired by a common understanding of the social order, science, and technology achievements. The book offers several empirical methods for working with this concept on the material of different countries and technologies: the Internet, gene modification technologies, and information technologies. The review draws attention to the connection of the social imaginary with earlier concepts of co-production and civil epistemologies of Sheila Jasanoff. The review presents the main characteristics of the sociotechnical imaginary, which were suggested by the authors of the collection. It touches upon the topic of potential researches that can be formulated to update the concept of the sociotechnical imaginary: how and by whom imaginary concepts are created, how these concepts can become collective. The review concludes with an attempt to describe the range of potential beneficiaries of the book. They are not only science and technology researchers, but also public policy researchers. For them, this book can be a starting point for reflection on most of the technologies that are embedded in our daily lives and exist in the field of political relations.

DE society; politics; Siberia; historiography
AB The author aims to identify the role and the place of the Encyclopedic dictionary "Social and Political Life in Siberia at the end of the 19th century - the beginning of the 20th century" (Novosibirsk, 2019) in the historiography of the social and political issues of the region. The analysis of the composition, structure, and the content of the Dictionary is based, on the one hand, on the retrospective overview of information and knowledge accumulated in the research works in this field, and, on the other hand, on addressing the characteristics of an encyclopedia as a specific genre of scientific and popular-science literature. The publication of the Encyclopedic dictionary is viewed as the first and generally successful experience of integration of the results of study of various aspects of political and social life in Siberia in the face of major social transformations. The main merits of this collective work are the following: 1) the multifaceted approach to historical reconstruction of the social and political situation in the region; 2) prominent historical and anthropological dimension that is shown in the vast amount of biographical information on key figures of the period; 3) focusing not only on major political processes but also on some local episodes and nuances that filled the social space of the region with unique content; 4) attention of the authors to "non-political" elements of people's life (such as charity, art, science, education, culture, leisure, etc.) which draws an adequate image of the social and cultural background. To present the information, the authors have chosen a format that is fully compliant with the requirements and canons of the encyclopedic genre. Representativeness, authenticity and verifiability of the data from the Dictionary are out of the question. It should be emphasized that the Dictionary has a scientific character. It is shown, in particular, in the high-quality historiographic reviews on all key topics and problems of the social and political life of the region. As a result, the reader has an opportunity to get an overview of the current state of the scientific comprehension and understanding of the problems that the Dictionary touches upon. As a whole, the analysis of the methodological basis, structure, and the content of the articles of the Encyclopedic dictionary provides valuable insights on the importance of the Dictionary as the summary of studying of the social and political processes in Siberia, and as a point for outlining the possible vectors and prospects for the future research.

TI THE CYBERNETICS MOVEMENT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE ANALOG/ DIGITAL
   DISTINCTION
SO LOGOS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE cybernetic movement; analog; digital; information; symbolic;
   poststructuralism; culture; science
AB The heterogeneity of the cybernetics movement, its blurred boundaries, its deep penetration into the scientific, cultural, political and religious institutions of different national communities - all these provide an opening for broadly different approaches to describing the cybernetics movement. Cybernetics was equally attractive to irreconcilable opponents - atheists and clerics, scientists and mystics, Communists and Liberals, cultural figures and counterculture activists. Any study, social or intellectual, of such heterogeneous movements requires simplification of that complexity. The main goal of the article is to find a basic unity that runs through the cultural, social, doctrinal, and institutional diversity of the cybernetics movement. The unifying feature had to meet three requirements: first, the starting point of the analysis should be the original problem that cybernetics addresses throughout its history to date; second, this problem must have a certain degree of universality, that is, its significance must be more than theoretical or applied so that it somehow resonates with philosophy, psychology, and with cultural, political or ideological forms of thought; third, the problem must be relevant in the context of current polemics.
   The distinction between analog and digital proved to be a convenient conceptual tool for drawing a sharp outline around cybernetics. The article does not attempt to provide a coherent treatment of its history but instead consists of several fragmentary ideas that are relevant to the history of cybernetics. It is also an experiment to show the potential of that approach. The main thesis presented is that an understanding of the history of the cybernetics movement can be systematic and productive when based on the analysis of the key cybernetic distinction between analog and digital. This approach reveals important shared problematics and genetic kinship in seemingly incompatible doctrines that make use of cybernetics (Wiener, Shannon) and poststructuralism (Foucault, Derrida, Lacan, Deleuze).

AB The purpose of the study: to identify the pedagogical conditions for patriotic education of future teachers in a university. Object of study: educational system of a university. Subject of research: patriotic education of future teachers in a university. In accordance with the purpose of the study, the following tasks were set: to identify the main theoretical aspects of patriotic education of future teachers and its features; to characterize the forms, methods and means conducive to patriotic education of future teachers; to identify pedagogical conditions for patriotic education of future teachers; to develop components for patriotic education of future teachers on the basis of the analysis of scientific literature.In this study, the following research methods were used: analysis, synthesis, analogy, abstraction, the study of psychological and pedagogical literature, questionnaires.The theoretical significance of the work is to comprehend and theoretically revise the problems devoted to patriotic education of future teachers in a university.The essence of patriotic education of young people in modern conditions is presented, which is understood as the formation of a patriotic consciousness (responsible attitude to nature, to oneself, as a whole with nature and society, to the world around and to the Motherland; focus on the value aspect of the formation of patriotism); patriotic behavior (activation of the activity aspect of future teachers), and patriotic feelings. The components of patriotic education are presented: motivational, cognitive, emotional, and activity components.It is concluded that the relevance of this problem is quite acute, and it is necessary to strengthen attention on patriotic education of youth. A survey conducted to study the level of patriotism of future teachers showed that negative qualities such as negativity towards modern political systems; negative attitude to their country; the desire of youth to leave Russia and live in Europe and the USA; highly developed individualism, egoism; disrespect for the older generation prevail in the minds of young people.

AB The paper is a review of a number of writings in the humanities and in social science devoted to George Martin's series of epic fantasy novels A Song of Ice and Fire, and the television-serial drama Game of Thrones. At the beginning, we analyze the researchers' most heuristically-fruitful intellectual reactions to Game of Thrones, that is, specific products such as texts that may be of interest to social theory. The main part of the article considers the institutional and discursive order of George Martin's saga through the research lens of the classics of modern social theory, such as Niccolo Machiavelli, Thomas Hobbes, and Max Weber. The paper then briefly touches upon the religious situation in Westeros, whose system of values and norms is paradoxically characterized by both post-secularism and a surge of religious fundamentalism. As a next step, it analyzes the political theology in the Game of Thrones, which is considered within the perspective of a transcendental legitimization of politics as proposed by Carl Schmitt. In conclusion, the paper considers Westeros' cognitive landscape which consists of various competing epistemic sets (maesters, septons, white walkers, etc.), and structurally reproduces the situation in the societies of late modernity.

DT Article; Book Chapter
DE North and South Korea; objects and subjects of international law;

AB In 1945-1948, before the DPRK and the ROK were established, Korea as a whole was an object, but not a subject of international law and did not play any role in the balance of power in Northeast Asia. With the formation of the DPRK and the ROK, they became subjects of international law. But their legal personality was limited for various reasons. The simultaneous accession to the UN in 1991 expanded the capabilities of the DPRK and the ROK to play a more significant role in the world, and also play a role in the balance of power in Northeast Asia. The participation of the DPRK in the six-party talks on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was a clear evidence of this. The ROK, having made an impressive leap in the economic development and deservedly becoming a member of the club of the largest economies in the world, the G20 and twice for the period of 1991-2020 becoming a non-permanent member of the UN security Council has significantly expanded its influence on world affairs and the balance of power in Northeast Asia. But limited sovereignty, dependence on military and political obligations to the United States, and the need to coordinate their actions on NEA issues with the United States, or rather, to get the approval of the United States, do not make the country a really influential element of the balance of power.

AB The article is devoted to the Chinese strategic culture and its manifestation in the implementation of the "one belt, one road" initiative as one of the most important directions of the modern foreign policy of the People's Republic of China.
   Strategic culture is defined as an appeal to ways of thinking and acting when dealing with issues of the use of force (including military) and security, rooted in the national historical experience, mentality and traditions of the people, reflecting the behavior of the state in critical situations.
   China's strategic culture is a body of elements of traditional Chinese culture that are applied in relations with other countries, which in reality is expressed in the struggle for the "historical" primacy and "central position" of China in the world. The desire to "revive the great Chinese nation" and return the country's "well-deserved" world championship is being implemented in the "One Belt - One Road " project, which combines the "land" and "sea" silk road. The initiative is a veiled external expansion of Chinese influence, as well as a tool of " soft power" of the ideological components inherent in Chinese strategic culture, extrapolating to the countries of the Eurasian continent. China is showing its new role in the international arena: China is becoming a different type of global hegemon, a "good" growing power, a reliable partner that leads humanity to a mutually beneficial community of common destiny.
   The "age of humiliation" gave rise to the desire of the Chinese people to restore global status and power, as evidenced by the slogans "revival of the great Chinese nation", "creation of a community of common destiny of humanity" led by the PRC, and the implementation of the "Chinese dream" of world domination. Confucius and Sun Tzu emphasized in their teachings that strategic defense, Alliance building, and the restrained use of force for clearly defined political purposes were preferred at the national level. The elements of Chinese philosophy clearly reflect the features of China's strategic culture.

AB The article considers the period of 1920-1930s as the time of building the Soviet society and the state, which took place under the influence of ideological foundations on the political, economic and social life of the country on the example of Buryat-Mongolian ASSR. The main attention paid to the analysis of education as one of the important means of statehood formation, which initiates the process of personality's spiritual development. The research source base consists of the materials of central and regional archives. Among them legislative and normative acts in the sphere of culture, art, enlightenment and education of the USSR and BMASSR; official documents and materials reflecting the activity of ministries, departments and structures of the All-Union Communist Party of Bolsheviks; analytical materials on the problems of ideological foundations of education in the 1920-1930s, as well as the works of representatives of the authorities and reminiscences of contemporaries.
   On the basis of archival materials, it is shown how extremely difficult tasks were solved: elimination of illiteracy, creation of the system of public education, formation of new intelligentsia staff, creation of conditions for development of humanities, literature and art, use of scientific achievements for socialist transformations. In order to analyze the conditions in which these processes took place, a set of scientific methods - general scientific (theoretical analysis and conceptualization) and special (historical and comparative, structural and functional, retrospective and historical and cultural methods) - was involved. The authors have identified the specifics of the cultural revolution of the national region, carried out on the basis of common patterns that took place in the country. First of all, Buryat-Mongolia has made a transition to socialism, bypassing the capitalist stage of development, which created additional difficulties - here for the first time were created national script and literary language, school, cultural institutions, literature and professional art. Territorial dispersion of the population due to nomadic and semi-nomadic ways of life, the presence of several socio-economic patterns were among the difficulties of a specific nature. In the course of the anti-religious campaign in the 1930s, the Datsan school, which was the basis of national education, was destroyed. The article traces the process of liquidation of traditional society institutions and their replacement with new ones, which determine the social context of a person's everyday life. It revealed that the general Soviet ideology in the national region served as a mobilization project for building a new society and growing a "new" person.6

AB The article is devoted to the problem of the perception in the USSR of C. Schmitt and his works. It is shown that the Russian Empire paid attention to and criticized Schmitt's 1912 work Law and Judgment. Soviet readers in the 1920s-1940s were already acquainted with the content of Schmitt's key works such as Political Romanticism, Dictatorship, The Historical and Spiritual State of Modern Parliamentarism, Political Theology, The Concept of Political, The Age of Neutralizations and Depoliticizations, and On the Three Types of Juristic Thought, and a discussion of these works was a part of the intellectual life of the USSR in the 1920s-1940s. Moreover, Soviet Marxist-theorists of law, while criticizing Schmitt's ideas, agreed with some of his ideas regarding the criticism of the bourgeois state and law until 1933. However, after 1933, Schmitt's works in the USSR turned into an object of harsh criticism, and he himself was proclaimed a key fascist theoretician of state and law. Since the late 1940s, because of the so-called struggle with "cosmopolitanism", Schmitt's works received less attention. In the 1950s-1970s, Schmitt's works appeared only in some critical statements, and the works of Soviet authors of the 1920s-1940s about Schmitt actually fell into oblivion. A new wave of interest in Schmitt began only in the second half of the 1980s, and his works can already be considered in the context of the intellectual history of modern Russia.

DE B. I. Siromiatnikov; history of historical science; Marxism; First
   Russian Revolution 1905-1907; Russian Empire
AB The article is devoted to the rethinking of theoretical and methodological foundations of the scholarly activities of B. I. Syromiatnikov, who was one of the leading Russian pre-revolutionary law historians. In historiography he has been described as a representative of critical positivism and a supporter of a factor approach to history. On the basis of information about his social activities and academic interests at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, the article demonstrates that he took a considerable interest in social problems and illegal socialist literature as well as in modern sociological thought, including Marxism. His European study trip from 1903 to 1905 only strengthened the interest in the works of Karl Marx. The examination of the journalistic articles by Syromiatnikov, published in the years of the First Russian Revolution, shows that by 1906 he had used ideas and analytical categories (socio-economic formation, class struggle) of K. Marx and his followers (A. Bebebel, K. Kautsky). In addition, he sympathized with right-wing socialists such as E. Bernstein and E. Vandervelde. Following the approaches of such thinkers, Syromiatnikov defined the contemporary political events in Russia as a liberal revolution, and considered that the socialist agenda was premature for Russia. Based on Marxist ideas and on the comparative historical method, the historian created in 1905 an original concept of the changes in forms of political organization of society in Russia from veche democracy to an absolutist state. Due to the fact that this scheme was developed with the use of Marxist ideas, Syromiatnikov was able to reproduce it in the framework of Soviet historical science.

   "Family Monarchy"
SO IMAGOLOGIYA I KOMPARATIVISTIKA-IMAGOLOGY AND COMPARATIVE STUDIES
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Russian literature; Russian epistolary culture; correspondence; Vasily
   Zhukovsky; royal persons; court culture
AB The article reviews the letters from royal persons to Vasily Zhukovsky. Based on these letters, the character of the epistolary dialogue between the poet and representatives of the Romanov dynasty and of the German dynasties is reconstructed completely for the first time. Zhukovsky was not the only writer who was warmly welcomed at court, but his case was unique. The poet organically joined the context of the new emerging ideology of "family monarchy", in which a small circle of the imperial family, professing family and domestic values, acted as a prototype of the all-imperial unity of subjects symbolically included in the sphere of paternal relations. Moreover, Zhukovsky was one of the co-creators and translators of this ideology. In addition, Zhukovsky, originally a reader under Empress Maria Feodorovna, entered the circle of royal persons as a poet and remained so until the end of his life. It was his tireless work that designated a new stage in the interaction of power and literature. The system of literary patronage, which determined the sociocultural functioning of the 18th-century literature, gradually faded into the past and was replaced by a system of literature friendly communities, in which informal groups were the centers of the literary process. The poet transferred these forms of communication to the court, transforming Pavlovsk and the circle of Maria Feodorovna, and then the circle of Alexandra Feodorovna, into a kind of a literary community. "Family monarchy" under the aegis of Zhukovsky acquired a distinct literary and aesthetic dimension. Art here became a necessary part of everyday life, which, on the one hand, set the standard for the royal persons' thinking and behavior, and, on the other, opened up channels for interaction with friendly communities outside the court. The conceptual framework of "family monarchy" legitimized private and home-centered topics of communication becoming a powerful filter that set etiquette forms that hindered the possibility of discussing many issues, be it business problems or politics. Based on the letters of Grand Duke Alexander Nikolaevich, the article shows how such etiquette communication worked, including how Alexander reacted to Zhukovsky's political reflections. On the other hand, the letters of the King of Prussia, Frederick William IV, demonstrate strategies for bypassing etiquette communication and going to informal friendly reflection. The appendix to the article is a chronological index of all known letters of the royal persons to Zhukovsky.

AB The article, with a brief tour into history, traces the evolution of Russian-Chinese partnership in modern conditions. It also describes main factors that play the most important role in the development of the dialogue and provides assessment of the US policy and its impact on the nature and depth of the interaction between Moscow and Beijing in international political, military-strategic and military-technical spheres.
   The author positively assesses role and place of Russian-Chinese co-operation in the security sphere within the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), justifies the need to increase its potential in the above mentioned direction, including by strengthening cooperation with the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO). In the face of attempts on the part of the United States to achieve changes in the international situation in their favor through subversive strategies, in order to counter them - it is proposed to develop a regulatory framework for coordinating interaction between the interested SCO and CSTO participants, as well as between these organizations themselves.
   Showing probable directions for further development of cooperation between Russia and China in the international political, military-technical and military-strategic spheres, the author takes a balanced approach in assessing both positive and negative sides of this process, arguing the need for high-quality content of the military cooperation between the two states.
   Revealing nature and concept of the "deferred military-political alliance" of Russia and the PRC, the author shows, that the demonstration by the RF and China of their ability and readiness to raise the level of mutual relations in the military-political sphere to the level of alliance (if necessary) can cause "sobering" effect on "strategic rivals" of Russia and China, keeping them from implementing aggressive intentions against our states and their partners by the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. That, in turn, contributes to strengthening of security and stability throughout the "Greater Eurasian Space".

DT Article; Book Chapter
DE Ho Chi Minh; Vietnam; USSR; China; Front Viet Minh; internationalism;
   political testament
AB The article analyzes 30 years of the life and work of Ho Chi Minh abroad, primarily in the Soviet Union (1923-1924 and 1934-38) and in China (1924-1927 and 1938-1940), partly in exile. Ho Chi Minh evaluated these years like this: in the USSR he studied the experience of party building, and in China the experience of the struggle against colonialists and feudal lords.
   Ho Chi Minh is one of those revolutionary leaders, whose name was known to millions of people during his lifetime and who has become truly legendary. Over the long years of his life in exile, Ho Chi Minh became a true internationalist, but in the first place he always had feelings of patriotism, the fate of his native country, enslaved by the colonialists. He has become a genuine symbol of national solidarity for the Vietnamese.
   The article discovers the genius of Ho Chi Minh in his creative choice of the path of the Vietnamese revolution, in particular: the strategy of a single broad national front at each particular stage of the re volution; a consistent course towards the implementation of the principle of freedom of religion of all participants in the front; a humane attitude towards the abdicated monarch and his family.
   The article confirms that Ho Chi Minh was a great friend of our people, he was unanimously called both in Vietnam and in the Soviet Union a man who laid the foundation of "fraternal friendship" between the peoples of two countries and contributed in every way to its development and consolidation.

DE Fred Dallmayr; international relations philosophy; non-Western IR

ID POLITICS
AB This paper attempts to analyze Fred Dallmayr's intellectual heritage through the lens of international relations philosophy. The author considers issues related to the construction of international relations philosophy as an independent discipline in the context of multiplicity of philosophies in contemporary world. As the volume "Cosmopolitan Civility: Global-Local Reflections with Fred Dallmayr" - a dialogue amongst scholars of various cultural backgrounds sharing Dallmayr's views - elaborates Dallmayr's notion of apophatic democracy, this paper contributes to the discussion by analyzing this concept as a local and global political ideal. The author examines the resources that non-Western cultures may use to conceptualize and practise apophatic democracy, and investigates the strengths of apophatic democracy as against liberal and agonistic democracy models from the standpoint of international relations theory. It is suggested that non-Western countries should employ not only their mainstream philosophical traditions when articulating domestic and external policies, but other schools of thought as well. Apophatic democracy may he regarded as a potential ethical ideal of wodd politics: its achievement is tooted in the reconceptualization of contemporary international relations theories within the framework of a global philosophy of international relations "to come" that would include non-Western epistemological, ethical, and other relevant philosophical notions. An example of such reconceptualization in international relations is E. Dussel's idea of three constituents of political space: human relations, political actors, and the common good as the political goal.

AB The author of the article holds the idea that the study of the theoretical and practical aspects of the problem of war requires constant reference to the methodological strategies of researching the subject. Some of these aspects have been in the focus of research attention for a long time, but in modem conditions, they acquire new dimensions and do not lose relevance. The article emphasizes that as methodological perspectives of this kind can be called primarily historical, economic, sociological and political science approaches to the study of wars. The author of the article considers a number of subjects requiring a comprehensive methodological analysis. Such is the study of military issues from the point of view of the state of the system of world politics; the role of the individual in matters of war and peace; analysis of the issues of war from the angle of correlation of military with non-military means of warfare. It is also emphasized that the study of scientific and technological factors that are acquiring an growing role in modem wars (as well as in solving the problem of preventing war) needs new special approaches. At the same time, the author states that the dynamics of scientific and technological factors stay insufficiently studied. The article says that the subject of war and peace must be viewed through the prism of optimal interaction between representatives of military science, on the one hand, and representatives of a number of social sciences, on the other.

AB The article is based on the results of the research project devoted to the role of the parliamentary diplomacy in the modern world politics. The project is realized by the Rethinking Russia and the Russian Center for Promotion of International Initiatives. The article deals with considering the phenomenon of the parliamentary diplomacy, analyzing its nature and sources. Based on observing multisided dynamics of world politics and global trends in the public-government relations, authors define parliamentary diplomacy with the overall context of public diplomacy as quite a relevant mechanism of the modern international communication. The parliamentary aspect is considered as one of the most illustrative and legitimate institutional conjunction of both government (parliament is a constitutional body of power) and public (MPs are representatives of people, of civil society) nature of the modern communication on the mega-political level. Authors also analyze some relevant practical aspects of the Russian parliamentary diplomacy both at bilateral and multilateral levels. Those include parliamentary assemblies of such international organizations as OSCE, CIS, CSTO etc. There is also some focus on parliamentary tracks at the mega-political level for getting over the challenges modern government and its policy face with.

TI SCIENCE POLICY PROGRAMS: A PARADIGM-BASED ANALYSIS
SO POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE science policy; scientific community; strategy of science and technology
   development; political sociology of science
AB The article offers an analysis of the conceptual sources of science policy, and the modem dynamics of its changes in program documents adopted by Russian executive authorities in the period from 1996 to 2016. The theoretical basis for the analysis is Kuhn's methodology, with particular emphasis placed on components such as distinguishing paradigms based on their incommensurability, and identifying paradigmatic documents that serve to form a common vision of reality as shared by a particular community. In relation to the formation period of modem science policy of the 1940-60s, two paradigms stand out - liberal and Marxist. The origin of the first is associated with support for research and development in the United States during and after the Second World War; the second is instead associated with the policies of the Soviet Union in the 1920s-1960s. The evolution of Soviet science policy starting from the 1960s followed the path of adopting the systems theory; this is the reason why it is more accurate to characterize it as a systems paradigm. This line of development was cut short in the early 1990s in connection with a sharp turn to the liberal paradigm, clearly manifested in documents of this period. However, in the 2000s, there was a return to systems vision. Now, the documents of the current decade are shifting to a new neoliberal paradigm, which is based on the notion of market organization as the main mechanism of governmental management, and within which autonomy for the scientific community is replaced by its organization according to market principles. At the same time, the 2016 Strategy for Scientific and Technological Development once again addresses the elements of the systems paradigm, trying to combine both elements of contractual organization of scientific research, which is one of the main components of the neoliberal vision, and direct management, which naturally follows from the systems approach. Paradigm analysis thus points to an internal contradiction inherent in Russian science policy, which complicates its implementation.

AB Drawing on archival materials from the State Archive of the Russian Federation and the Russian State Archive of Social and Political History, the article studies activities of the Yaroslavl gubernia organization of the RCP (B) and its interactions with the Left Socialist Revolutionaries on various political issues in June-July 1918. During this period, numerous conflicts occurred between representatives of two Soviet parties, which was reflected in the policies of local Bolsheviks, among whom there sprung several groups with different views on cooperation with the Left Socialist Revolutionary party. Studying the conflict in the Yaroslavl party organization and identifying its causes and main participants has its novelty. Archival documents are being introduces into scientific use that shed light on the circumstances of this conflict in the context of sociopolitical situation of summer 1918. The author examines the attitude of local leaders of the RCP (B) to regional representatives of the Left Socialist Revolutionaries and explores the relationship between the leadership of the Bolshevik Party and the Yaroslavl Bolsheviks on local politics issues. The analysis of archival documents suggests the existence of two opposing points of view on relations between the Bolsheviks and the Left Socialist Revolutionaries in the Yaroslavl party organization of the RCP (B), which caused controversy among Yaroslavl Bolsheviks. A significant role in strengthening of the controversy in the Yaroslavl party organization was played by the military commissar S. M. Nakhimson who succeeded in changing rules for electing delegates to the Congress of Soviets of the Yaroslavl province. The conflict in the Yaroslavl party organization was closely connected with activities of the Left Social Revolutionaries who had great influence in the gubernia. Some Yaroslavl Bolsheviks sought to continue cooperation and opposed strengthening confrontation. However, in early July, Nakhimson's position prevailed among the members of the Yaroslavl organization of the RCP (B). Having studied the archival documents, the author concludes that it was the irreconcilable position of Nakhimson on Bolsheviks and Left Socialist Revolutionaries cooperation that caused the split of the provincial Congress of Soviets and the crisis of power, which the White Guard used to organize the Yaroslavl insurgency.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE elections; electoral observation; electoral standards; Organization of
   American States
AB Although by the beginning of the 21st century the institution of elections had become an inalienable part of the political system of almost all countries of the world, it does not guarantee a genuine public control over the formation and activities of the authorities everywhere and often serves as a decoration designed to legitimize the autocratic regime. In order to fill this institution with the real content, standards are required to distinguish between real elections and imitation of elections. This naturally begs the question whether a priori attitudes or practice influence the formation of such standards to a greater extent.
   In order to answer this question, the author turns to the experience of the Organization of American States (OAS). The subject of his research is the connection between the recommendations of the OAS electoral observation missions and manuals on various aspects of the electoral process published by OAS. His analysis shows that the recommendations of the observation missions significantly influenced the structure and content of the manuals on the methodology for monitoring elections, media and campaign finance, as well as the International Electoral Standard TS 17582. On the contrary, the manuals for incorporating a gender perspective into the activities of OAS observers and monitoring the participation of indigenous population and African Americans in the elections for the most part form common attitudes, on the basis of which recommendations should be made. In many respects, this also applies to the manuals for the use of digital technologies in the election process. Manuals on electoral justice also dictate attitudes, but at the same time they have little effect on recommendations in the field of electoral justice, as well as political and legal systems, which are mainly empirical in nature and weakly correlated with the topics of the manuals.
   According to the author, the experience of Latin American countries clearly demonstrates that a positive answer to the fundamental question of whether the society should control authorities does not at all imply the ending, but rather the beginning of a long process of developing procedures and standards that guarantee the democratic nature of elections. Moreover, during this process there is a great risk of turning on the wrong path that leads to a dead end or trampling in place.

DT Article; Book Chapter
DE Japan-South Korea economic relations; historical experience; modern
   realities; prospects for development
AB In retrospect, the relationship between Japan and the Republic of Korea is quite a complex system. After the Second World War, the parties took more than a decade to develop a stable paradigm of bilateral relations with the predominance of mutual economic interests, rather than historical grievances. Japan was the first East Asian country to embark on a large-scale economic modernization in the 1950s; the Republic of Korea launched these processes a little later and took into account the Japanese experience, but there is no question of copying it literally. Currently, there is a significant cooling of Japanese-Korean relations, and an assessment of the past experience of overcoming foreign policy crises that led to a decrease in economic activity will allow us to predict the prospects and ways out of this situation.
   Despite periodic disputes over moral and material compensation from Japan for its actions on the Korean Peninsula in the first half of the XX century, both countries managed to find a mutually acceptable compromise, without bringing the situation to an open official confrontation with the prospect of imposing mutual sanctions. The political crisis in bilateral relations, which turned into a local trade war in the summer of 2019, promises to become the most intense in the past decades.

AB In early 1810, when the major part of the Iberian Peninsula was under the control of the French army, the impregnable Cadiz, unsuccessfully besieged by French troops for almost 30 months, turned into the capital of independent Spain. The press of Cadiz 1810-1812, represented by dozens of printed publications, reflected the process of activation of the social and political life of the city and became one of the strongest weapons of anti-French propaganda. The author of this paper attempts to analyze the material of three newspapers - El Conciso, Diario mercantil de Cadiz and El Observador - with the aim to identify the features of the representation of the images of the enemy and ally in the press of besieged Cadiz in 1810-1812. The text focuses on the opinions on France, the French Revolution, Napoleon Bonaparte, "josefinos", George III, British soldiers and the Duke of Wellington reflected in the newspapers. It is noted that the newspapers demostrated various attitudes towards the significance of the French Revolution and the role of French soldiers in the Napoleonic Wars, which was largely due to the political orientation of the newspapers. Nevertheless, the Cadiz press demonstrates the similarity of attitudes towards the images of Napoleon as the tyrant and usurper of the French throne, and the British soldiers and the Duke of Wellington as the blessed saviors of Spain from the French occupation.

AB The review article dedicated to the new book by K.M. Anderson "Utopians and pragmatists: episodes in the history of Western social thought" (Moscow, 2019) shows the author's unique approach, which combined various techniques and means of scientific research with a bright style of storytelling. The author substantiates the conclusion that K.M. Anderson was able to present theoretical generalizations that make the book an important contribution to the history of social and political thought of the past. This is a book-reflection on the currents of public thought in the West, important events and personalities, makes us think about many aspects of history, previously unnoticed, or taken for empty nonsense. The "worlds" discovered by K.M. Anderson show that utopia is a premature truth waiting for its time and its historian.

AB The dynamics of the memory policy aimed at forming in the historical memory of the readership of the Siberian Lights Magazine of the 1920s-1940s ideas about the historical past and traditional culture of Altai people is traced in the article. The relevance of the study is due to the growing attention to the features of historical knowledge in the public space, its structuring, the means of conceptual interpretation and the use in the processes of political self-regulation of society at various stages of development. The novelty of the research is seen in the fact that the history of the state policy of memory in relation to the past of Gorny Altai in its substantive and procedural aspects has not yet become the subject of independent scientific research. The contexts and conditions of creating journal representations of the historical past of Gorny Altai are revealed. The list of the authors covering this topic is characterized, as well as the factors that influenced the creation of journal representations of the history of the Altai people. The stages of this representation are established and characterized. It is shown how the memory policy techniques used by the authors of this journal at different stages changed. It is proved that at the stage of the 1920s, the Siberian Lights served as a platform for polemics of historians and subjects of regional politics, relatively independent in relation to the central government. At the second stage of the 1930s - 1940s, the authors of the journal were included, first of all, in the process of implementing the policy of memory of the central authorities.

AB The article examines the representations of the past and traditional culture of the Tuvan people on the pages of the "Sibirskie Ogni" ("Siberian Lights"), the oldest in Siberia (and one of the oldest surviving in Russia) literary, art and socio-political magazine. Founded in the 1920s, Sibirskie Ogni will be studied here in the context of developing a state policy of memory.
   Given that during the 20th century Tuva underwent enormous modernization, the authors explain why collective memory of the past is important for traditional society in terms of maintaining socio-political order. Also shown is how the Soviet periodical helped the state authorities politicize Tuvan history.
   The authors have examined over 30 publications on history, culture and literature of Tuva which appeared in the magazine, as well as editorial correspondence and documentation. The succession of these sources shows the transformation of how the magazine's authors represented traditional Tuvan culture. From harsh criticism and aversion the tone of these publications slowly changed to reveal an attempt to see it as a rediscovered source of the region's unique development model.
   The article traces four stages of constructing the representations of history and traditional Tuvan culture in the Sibirskie Ogni: mid-1920s to late 1940s, late 1940s to early 1980s, the rest of the 1980s and the early 1990s to present times.

AB Emergence of the new education as a global phenomenon rather than a local or national one has been prompted by the awareness of the planetary scale of the environmental, economic and political challenges of the 21st century as well as by the ongoing trend toward the globalization of the economic, political and cultural life. For this reason, the elaboration of the mechanisms of the innovation development in the universities has become an urgent need of the modern society. In this case, the innovation development of a higher education establishment is perceived as a goal-driven process of the university transformation by means of building up the innovation infrastructure and integration of the education, science and business with the purpose of developing technologies of the future and, thus, acquiring new competencies by the mutual effort of the university staff, students and administration managing the educational process.

AB Faced with global environmental and energy challenges, the Chinese leadership is striving to accelerate the development and introduction of new-generation of vehicles using alternative energy sources, in particular, those powered by hydrogen fuel, and is striving to overtake world leaders in the creation of production and refueling infrastructure. Realizing that the development of an innovative industry of the production of cars powered by hydrogen is impossible without creating an appropriate base for the production of hydrogen fuel cells and hydrogen gas stations, the State Committee for the development and reform has launched a targeted state investment and economic policy in the field of creating elements of urban infrastructure that supply hydrogen for a new type of transport, and has actively encouraged the construction of plants for the production of hydrogen fuel cells. Today, the growth rate of the innovative hydrogen charging stations' number in China is comparable to the growth rate of the fleet of new "green" cars, which demonstrates the importance of charging infrastructure for the further development of Chinese hydrogen transport and allows the country to become a world leader in creating advanced technologies that provide charging of "green" cars.
   While implementing the plans of the Chinese leadership for the large-scale construction of plants for the production and storage of hydrogen for "green" cars, as well as developing the adequate service infrastructure, in the coming years we should expect the appearance of a large number of cars running on public roads in China, using a new type of fuel - hydrogen.

   revolution of 1821
AB The article is devoted to the Russian-Greek ecclesiastical and political relations before and during the Eastern Crisis of the 1820s. After the start of the Greek uprising in 1821, Russia took an ambivalent position: as a patron of all orthodox Christians in the Ottoman Empire, it sought to support the Greeks, but Russia also had to recognize the Greek revolution as an illegitimate rebellion. Asa member of the Holy Alliance of European Powers Russia had no other choice but to adhere to the principles of legitimism. Russia had both political and economic interests in the region. After the Greek uprising, main powers in the Western Europe had no doubt that Russia would support the rebels. Nevertheless, Russia regarded the Greek rebellion as another European revolution. After a successful war of independence, Russia established its diplomatic mission in the Greek capital. The first ambassador was P.1. Rickman, who arrived with aim to provide political relations with this new Balkan state. If political support of the rebellion could find no understanding in the conservative European circles, the aid of the Orthodox Balkan Church was implied by the Treaty of Kucuk Kaynarca 1774. Special attention in this support, provided by the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church to the Greek monasteries, was paid to the Athos monasteries. This support was designed by a special document. It was adopted in 1735 under the Empress Anna Ivanovna and was subject to execution in subsequent years. The Archive of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has kept lists of all Orthodox monasteries on the territory of the Ottoman Empire that enjoyed material support from the Russian church; a significant part of this list are the Orthodox churches of Greece.

AB In the beginning of September 2019, there took place the anti-Chinese protests in Kazakhstan with economic and political claims. Participants stated against the construction in Kazakhstan of "55 Chinese factories" that were supposed to build according to the intergovernmental agreement.
   The article studies the hypothesis that Moscow has chances to face the same challenges as Nur-Sultan does within the cooperation with Beijing, because Russian and Kazakhstan have the similar model of political and economic cooperation with China.
   After the analysis of the reasons of anti-Chinese protests in Kazakhstan, the author introduces recommendations to reduce the risk of the similar protests in Russia, the protests which have negative influence to the development of Russian-Chinese relations. The findings show that the effective dialogue between citizens and politics and the transparency of joint bilateral projects should be organized and be oriented to explain to the local citizens the advantages and the interests of cooperation with Chinese companies.

AB The article discusses the evolution of the Greater Eurasian partnership, analyses geopolitical reasons for the initiation of the project and characterizes the GEP's integration with the whole system of international relations.
   Prerequisites for integration processes evolved in the beginning of 2010-th, when the countries faced the serious foreign policy challenges related to the growth of economic and political rivalry in Eurasia.
   The intension of Moscow to maintain and enforce its influence in the region has become the geopolitical motive of the GEP's introduction. The idea of the Greater Eurasian Partnership reflects perceptions of Russian political leadership of the future regional order. The GEP is promoted as an initiative oriented to maintain political stability, to provide security and to create conditions for trade-economic development and co-operation in the investment and finance areas.
   Regional integration in Eurasia is being developed predominantly by two main players, Russia and China, via mechanisms of Eurasian Economic Union and China's Silk Road Economic Belt initiative, with idea that the Shanghai Cooperation Organization may also be used as one of probable platforms for integration.
   The process of legal substantiation of the GEP is carried out by Russia with the support of the Chinese side during the exchange of high-level visits, when relevant statements are included in joint declarations of the parties. Besides, that both sides have created an efficient mechanism of regular interaction on different levels: from meetings of state leaders to the contacts of heads of departments in different ministries and agencies.
   Russia and China are conscious of risks of their geopolitical rivalry. In order to overcome them, both countries are diligently trying to avoid unnecessary competition and consistently demonstrate it the joint statements. Moscow and Beijing focus mutual efforts on building such frameworks of cooperation which can allow them to conjugate their flagship initiatives in Eurasia. The readiness of Russia and China to coordinate the integration process in Eurasia is determined by the fact that single-handed efforts of any country would not be enough to implement the full range integration potential of the region.
   The author comes to the conclusion that strategic partnership between Moscow and Beijing is the key factor for successful development of Russia's and China's integration initiatives in Eurasia.

DT Article
DE Johann Gustav Droysen; theory of historiography; methodology of
   historiography; theory of state; institutional theory; theory of modern
   society; institutional dynamics of modernity
AB The article analyzes several crucial aspects of Johann Gustav Droysen's theory of historiography (as presented in the collection of his lectures published under the title Historik). The significance and reception of Droysen's legacy in contemporary historiography are examined primarily in the American and Russian contexts. The fundamental features of Droysen's theory of historiography are then identified with emphasis on: validation of the autonomy of history as a science; radical constructivism; moderate relativism; presentism; and the extension of the subject matter of hermeneutics to existential and anthropological issues. The main part of the article is devoted to Droysen's institutional theory and maintains that Historik provides more than a theory and methodology of historiography by also advancing an original institutional theory which serves as a direct link between Hegel's philosophy and current social and political concepts. Droysen's position on Hegel's philosophy is considered, and the derivation of "the ethical world," Droysen's the principal category for institutional analysisis traced back to Hegel. Droysen's theory of the state, which identifies it as the only source of legitimate violence and a mechanism for neutralizing conflicts in civil society and distinguishes between the notions of "power" and "violence; is treated in detail.
   Three main aspects of Droysen's institutional theory are discussed. First, there is an analysis of his formal theoretical understanding of the concept of an "institution" as it compares to the basic modern philosophical and theoretical definitions of that concept. Then, the main substantive features of his institutional theory are examined. These include the three types of institutions (natural, ideal and practical), and the distinction between them will later play a prominent role in modern social theory and sociology. Finally, Droysen's account of the institutional dynamics of modernity is explicated as a taut equilibrium between the puruist of stability by institutions and the disruption of their stability by normative reflection and criticism.

AB The presented article contains a brief comparative analysis of the terminology used in the social sciences that study public policy to describe the characteristics of the "strength" / "weakness" of the state, using North American, Latin American, and Russian sources as examples. The article states that in most of the cases under consideration, the descriptive characteristics of the state's weakness used by researchers evaluate the political regime and its "relations" with society through civil society institutions. The main focus of the study is the conceptual variability of the terms describing statehood in the social sciences, namely: "weak state" / "fragile state", "failed state" / "failed state", "anocracy", "absent" / "absentee state" and desert state / "estado desertor" in the context of the relationship of the characteristics of the political system and economic development of the state.The article indicates an increased interest in describing the so-called "weak state" or "failed state", as well as transitional and "hybrid forms", as opposed to the primary interest of 20th century social scientists in describing, studying and comparing democratic, authoritarian and totalitarian regimes in the context of their influence on the economic potential of the state.

AB The article analyzes how global socio-political destabilization manifests itself, and how this is associated with the growing inefficiency of many international institutions due to an increasingly dysfunctional "unipolar" world order model. By focusing on the examples of the EU and the Russian Federation, this article studies the influence of global destabilization on the dynamics of political institutions both on the level of individual states and on the supranational level. Some general characteristics defining the modern political and institutional dynamics across EU countries are analyzed; these are associated with processes for strengthening socio-political destabilization. These trends, in particular, include: the decline in the effectiveness of traditional political parties, the growing polarization of party-political systems; the rise of populism, euroscepticism and right-wing radicalism; intensified contradictions in interactions between central and regional political institutions, amidst the growth of separatist sentiments; and the collapse and fundamental transformation of the structure and functions of the national state (nation-state) as an "ideal". It is shown that the supranational political institutions of the EU as a whole are not effective enough in responding to the new challenges of external cultural migration, political polarization within European societies, the crisis of the social state, and the global COVID-19 epidemic. The reasons for this inefficiency are analyzed. In Russia, which is yet to fully take the form of a Western European-type nation-state, the political institutions introduced in the 1990s are undergoing intensive changes, adapting to this global destabilization in accordance with the model of institutional tracks that is different from the model of the national state. This involves applying elements of an imperial socio-political organization. Therefore, the first part of the study is devoted to the analysis of the problems and symptoms of increasing global destabilization and the formulation of the research problem; this is then solved in the next three parts. In a comparative perspective, three cases of institutional dynamics were studied: the EU as a whole, the EU at the level of national states, and the Russian Federation as a paradoxical state (national in form, but evolving in a different direction). The final part discusses the results and main findings of the study. From 2020 to 2030, as the EU and Russia are entering a period of deep and critical institutional, it is predicted that they must transform and adapt to the upcoming dramatic remodeling of the world order.

AB The destabilization of world politics over the last decade has actualized the need fora deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the nature of a modern state and its ability to adapt to changes both in the sphere of interstate relations and in domestic politics (the relationship of the state apparatus with its national political community, i.e. outside and within the legitimate territorial control of the state). An major - and in many respects irreplaceable - contribution to solving this problem is the foundational monograph by Bob Jessop, translated into Russian last year (Jessop B. 2016. The State: Past, Present, Future. Cambridge: Polity). Due to the complexity and versatility ofJessop's monograph, this article it will inevitably be limited to only a partial reflection; moreover, this will be approached from an obviously subjective point of view, and in the format of free reflection. The purpose of the article is to draw readers' attention to the invaluable resource of conceptualization and polymorphic analysis of the state as still being the key concept of political science it remains today. Jessop combines his original approach (in his words, strategic-relational) to this phenomenon of our political imagination with a critical analysis of other, widespread approaches (Marxism, liberalism, con.savatism, realism, neorealism), In fact, he offers a method to fundamentally synthesise these approaches, leading to a new quality of political analysis. Historicism, comparativism, the global context, and the evolving nature of statehood are the basis of this alternative approach to the systemic study of the state and state power. Almost conventional in modern political science, the concept of the modern state as such - including its fundamental, institutionally separate components, as well as the principles that integrate it descnbes, according to Jessop, only a special case of the capitalist-type state. Along with this essentially "idealized" state, there are still states of a different type, which also effectively ensure the interests of their political communities, without possessing all the nonnative characteristics (as they are defined by the canons of political science) of the institutional structure and without strictly observing the general principles of organizing social , economic and political life.

AB Being the basis of the "Stalinist" economic policy, both due to the peculiarities of ideology and in the perspective of solving geopolitical problems, the struggle for the country's economic independence formed the post-war trajectory of the USSR. The purpose of the paper was to identify the influence of this factor on decisions taken by the Soviet leadership, both in domestic and in foreign policy. Archival materials that have become available to researchers make it possible to clarify the "Stalinist" strategy for solving the task of restoring the national economy and keeping countries of "people's democracy" in the zone of influence in the conditions of the formation of a bipolar world with an acute shortage of resources. The authors of the paper rely on a source database stored in the Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History (RGASPI), in the funds of the Central Committee of the CPSU, in the funds of V.M. Molotov and of A.I. Mikoyan. Continued work with documents in this area promises to open the curtain on the "white spots" of late Stalinism, which remain the subject of heated discussions in historiography. Moreover, it is the post-war period that allows analyzing the "Stalinist" managerial model in its most complete form. Thus, it is also important to investigate its mechanisms from the point of view of solving the problem of the effectiveness / non-effectiveness of the Soviet system.

AB The article gives an updated picture of China's economic engagement with Central Asia (as of beginning of 2020). It identifies the years of 2008-2009 as a fracture point in China's economic presence in this region. That was the time when China overtook Russia as Central Asia's major trade partner, and when Chinese loans and investment in the region started to enhance considerably and to be diversified between different countries and sectors of economy. Basing on the analysis of recent statistics on China's loans and investment in Central Asian countries, the article demonstrates the importance of China as a provider of financing, investment, and infrastructure expertise for Central Asian countries, specifically for Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The article is arranged in several thematic blocks with each block explaining Beijing's specific priority or goal in Central Asia and China's corresponding economic undertakings aimed to meet this goal. First of all, China's economic engagement with Central Asia is seen as targeted at ensuring socio-political stability and regional security through economic development. Beijing's second priority is to gain access to Central Asia's vast natural resources. In this respect, the article discusses major forms and accomplishments of China's involvement in Central Asian hydrocarbon, uranium, gold and silver sectors. Since 2013, the initiation of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the economic drivers or priorities of Chinese activities in Central Asia are changing. Beijing has shifted its focus from occupying a niche in the oil and gas sector of Central Asian countries to expanding its participation in the region's infrastructure development and the creation of international transport corridors passing through Central Asia and oriented to China. The article concludes that in the years to come China's efforts in Central Asia will concentrate on further expanding its activities in construction and infrastructure development - highly profitable areas where Beijing doesn't meet competition from other world economic actors.

AB The article is devoted to the problem of the impact of the "historiographic revolution" occurred at the turn of the XX-XXI centuries to the dissertation culture of contemporary Russian historians. The study is based on the full-text collection "Electronic library of dissertations of the Russian State Library", an online resource. On the example of doctoral dissertations on Russian history defended in 2015-2019, the author examines the priorities of Russian historians in choosing problematics and chronological framework of scholarly works, analyzes theoretical and methodological foundations of their studies as well as their ideas about the social mission of history. She proves that most authors of doctoral dissertations choose the post-reform or Soviet period of Russian history for study, and highlights two blocks of priority topics: the history of state policy and governance, and social history. An analysis of the methodology of dissertations (scientific and qualification works) led to the conclusion that the nature of Russian historical science has changed as a result of an anthropological turn, which allows us to take a fresh look at the problems of political, economic and social history. Historians are increasingly setting the task of understanding people of the past in the whole variety of their mental structures, social connections, strategies and practices, both in everyday situations and in extreme conditions. But in practice, writing a dissertation requires not only a high degree of professional reflection, but also the ability to fulfil the formal requirements for scientific and qualification work: original ideas are sometimes difficult to fit into template, cliched formulations that have become generally accepted in the scholarly community.

AB The article is devoted to the reaction of the American press to such an important historical event as the founding of the People's Republic of China. The emergence of a new communist state in the East was a great shock and blow to the foreign policy ambitions of the United States, which developed in the logic of a global confrontation with the Soviet Union. China, rich in resources since the end of the 19th century, has been the scene of a constant clash of interests of various states, as a result, on the eve and, especially, after World War II, the two main political forces operating in this territory the Communist Party of China (CCP) and the nationalist party Kuomintang - found themselves powerful patrons in the form of the USSR and the USA. The topic of the reaction of the American press to the actual failure or, as he later said, was dubbed by numerous experts and publicists who wrote about China - the "loss of China" is an interesting marker of how socio-political thought developed in the American media. American journalists are trying to predict the political consequences of the "loss", to level the image damage caused to the population by Washington's foreign policy, to convey the facts and at the same time assess the situation in the region. The study of US press articles will make it possible to better understand the development of American ideas about China and its place in the new paradigm of international relations, to better explore the level of media awareness of this region and the impact that ideas and assessments broadcast by journalists had on society, as well as generally to better understand the initial reaction of American society to the founding of the PRC. Many of the ideas formed at that time remain today an important component of the discursive practices of US public and political life, especially taking into account the complex relations between modern China and the United States.

AB The issue of how the an important and multifaceted aspect of domestic and foreign policy formed by US FBI, called the "Red Scare" is addressed in the article. It is shown that this political and ideological concept seemed unacceptable for distribution in the United States, since it created a danger of the penetration of communist ideas and their adherents into all government bodies and major public organizations. Factors that influenced the strengthening of the FBI's position in the fight against communist ideology in the United States in the 1920s, in particular, terrorist acts carried out by left-wing forces, which allowed the FBI to implement a program of struggle (Palmer raids) with organizations, adhering to communist views are examined. The measures taken by the FBI and its director John Edgar Hoover in the 1930s against Soviet intelligence, which contributed to reinforcing negative perceptions of the "Red Scare" within the agency are highlighted. The authors conclude that the position of the FBI influenced the building of the attitude of the entire US intelligence community in this vein, which in turn had a great impact on the development of the country's domestic and foreign policy.

AB Introduction. The popularity of images of birds of prey in Scythian art makes us pay more attention to the place of birds of prey in the life of the Scythian world. Birds of prey were actively used in the hunting practice, and hunting with hunting birds was an elite form of hunting common in open spaces. Materials. The first information about nurseries of hunting birds belongs to ancient China of the 7 th century BC. Images of hunting birds appear on Hittite basreliefs of the 13 th century BC. They are also known in the Assyria of the time of Sargon II. Analysis. The active participation of the Scythians in political events in the Middle East allows us to assume that the Scythians are familiar with this method of hunting. In Scythian culture, there are a series of images of attacking birds, which should be seen as naturalistic sketches. Results. The abundance of bone remains of hunting birds in the cultural layers of Scythian settlements and the presence of a burial of a man with a Falcon in the materials of the Elizavetovskoe hillfort directly indicates the use of hunting birds in the South Easten European continent steppe as early as the 4th century BC.

AB The article is concerned with the history of the existence and symbolic transformation of the lattice of the garden of the Winter Palace throughout the 20th century. The fence erected by the will of Empress Alexandra Fedorovna became a symbol of the Russian monarchy. The tragic events that unfolded in the immediate vicinity of the fence on January 9, 1905 "connected" the lattice and the First Russian Revolution into a single commemorative space. After the revolution of 1917 the lattice was disfigured (double-headed eagles and monograms were broken) and was installed on the working outskirts. The author tried to understand why that was happened, and turned to the analysis of archival paperwork and reconstructed the history of another attempt at symbolic transformation of the lattice in the mid-1920s. The lattice is a semantically complex monument, the struggle of various actors for the "recoding" of which continued throughout the 20th century. Both research methods traditional for historical science are used, as well as those associated with the concept of "symbolic politics", including the comparison method of B. Forest and D. Johnson, who consider monuments as symbolic capital for which political actors are fighting. Drawings of the monogram filling of the lattice are first introduced into the historical science.

DT Article
DE Russian Orthodox Church; church-state relations; coronavirus pandemic
AB The widespread idea about the Russian Orthodox Church as an institution incapable of development needs to be substantially modified. The conservatism inherent in the Church should not be confused with reactionism, which is not its immanent attribute. Moreover, it is possible to talk about the internal polyphony of the Church, which incorporates a fairly wide range of views.
   Historically, the Russian Orthodox Church has been distinguished by an extremely high degree of adaptability, the ability to integrate different traditions even in such conservative areas as worship, but in the Soviet years it was "encapsulated" and largely turned into a hermetic structure with the focus on preserving tradition. The current situation in the Russian Orthodox community is characterized by a huge gap between the number of "nominal" and "practising" believers. At the same time, the low and diffuse mass religiosity is compensated and, so to say, replaced by the increased activity of the practising minority and priests. But the active minority in the Russian Orthodox Church is heterogeneous and is split into several groups, the most important of which are conservatives and pragmatists.
   The internal polyphony of the Russian Orthodox Church was clearly visible during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. The situation touched upon the church-state relations, as well as the question of the role of confessions in modern society, rather than boiling down to the usual confrontation between liberals and conservatives. The pandemic not only exacerbated the contradictions between pragmatists and conservatives, but also led to the serious disagreements between the state and the Church that looked up to its influential conservatives in the decision-making process. However, since the Church as an institution is not ready to oppose state power, the prevailing model of relations between them is likely to remain, although it may become less idyllic.

AB In 2017, a collective work of German specialists in Slavic Studies was published in Berlin. This book was Handbuch des Russischen in Deutschland: Migration, Mehrsprachigkeit, Spracherwerb (Guide to the Russian Language in Germany: Migration, Multilingualism, Language Mastery and Proficiency), which considers the fate of the Russian language in Germany in the historical and cultural perspective and in terms of its study and teaching over recent decades. Although the emphasis in the book is primarily on sociolinguistic issues, which is mainly associated with the large Russian-speaking diaspora in Germany, a number of works are devoted to mutual perception stereotypes of Russians and Germans, translations of Russian literature into German, and the role of the Russian language in the multilingualism policy of the European Union. Our article presents a detailed critical analysis of this collective work, highlights the main trends of modern Russian studies in Germany, and draws attention to biased manipulative moments in some works related to the political situation in the world. In general, the Guide is designed in an objective analytical manner and represents an impressive collection of extremely diverse materials, which form an integral image of the knowledge and development of the Russian language in Germany.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE revolution; political order; Modernity; world economy; political
   subject; consensus; rentier society
AB Revolution is simultaneously a legitimizing and deniable center of the ideological coordinates of Modernity. In terms of the speed of social changes, the historical evolution of Modernity from an early industrial, class-national political form to a recent, or global, state, should be described as nothing else but a revolution of low intensity. On the other hand, this permanent modernization is not revolutionary in a sense that periodic splits of elites, elite coups, national liberation movements etc. by themselves do not imply fundamental changes in the value-institutional constitution of the modern political order. Therefore, the possibility of a new revolution is due to the potential rejection of contemporary society from Modernity in favor of an alternative political project that surpasses the current configuration of social forces in terms of its ability to provide political legitimization, universalization and totalization. If capitalism, liberal consensus, and nationstate as the dominant format for their synthesis are the value-institutional quintessence of the political order of Modernity, then it is the challenges to free markets, liberalism and nationalism that will be the most obvious way to crystallize revolutionary movements. Currently, despite postmodern and neoliberal criticism of the liberal consensus, growing populism, the obvious limits of the market model of capitalism, flaws in a representative democracy, the weakening of the social state and other challenges to the political order of the late Modernity, it is about the internal transformations of modern societies rather than a full-fledged alternative to this order. In the long run, the increasing "rentier" reshuffling of capitalism might lead to a serious and, possibly, revolutionary, correction of Modernity.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE capitalism; post-capitalism; limits of growth; legitimation; democracy;
   inequality; political form; populism; market society; rent society;
   utopia
AB The natural limits of capitalism are expressed not only in the global suspension of economic growth, which has been considered endless. It is also a crisis of its non-economic legitimization, of those political forms that have made possible smoothing of inequality generated by capitalism. The nation-state, the model of social state and representative democracy were the mechanisms of access for the most citizens to the fruits of the economic growth generated by capitalism. However, the growth limits of available public resources did not significantly change the strategies of political and economic elites. Attempts to redistribute the non-growing public pie were expressed in neoliberal rhetoric; devaluation of the political nation model as co-citizenship; reduction of forms of social policy; the crisis of democracy, expressed in a return to its narrow interpretation as Schumpeterian competition of the elites. The tendencies related to the fact that the elites would like to keep receiving an additional piece of the public pie at the expense of the majority, reinforce inequality and deprive capitalism of convincing value-institutional regulation that have earlier ensured its stable existence. There is a growing demand in society for return to a more egalitarian model of the distribution of public resources. Its options are less and less associated with capitalism as a society dominated by market metaphor that ideologically represents modernity, but for many reasons has ceased to provide acceptable prospects for the majority. It seems that rental society is becoming an alternative to capitalism without economic growth and with a shrinking labor market. In the rental society, the key mechanisms of stratification and access to resources are again moving from the market to the nation-state, non-market types of public exchanges are strengthening, and social policy is striving for a model of basic unconditional income. The room for social construction is reduced to local utopias and virtues of various minorities, while populism becomes the dominant form of political discourse, which instead of decaying economic classes turns to the majority and is compatible with both the right and the left political value systems.

DE energy; renewable energy sources; Energy Transition; the Strategy of
   "energy dominance" of the United States; China
AB The article discusses prospects for the development of the world energy market, associated with the growth of its instability, the imbalance of supply and demand for oil and natural gas. At the same time, the factor of the imbalance deepening is the expansion of production and industrial use of shale hydrocarbons in the United States, which increase inter-fuel competition in national and global markets and provoke new "shock" phenomena in the world economy.
   The article analyzes new trends in the development of global energy, which have an impact on China.
   One of the main trends in the global energy sector is the "Fourth energy transition", i.e. the transition to the widespread use of renewable energy sources that replace fossil fuels. The author assesses the current success of China in the field of renewable energy, especially in heliogeneration, and puts forward forecasts for the future prospects of alternative energy in China.
   A serious challenge to the world community is the "2017 Energy Dominance Strategy" of the United States, which lays basis for American energy policy in the medium term. One of the "nubs" of the Strategy is its full support for intensive development of American shale resources on the coasts of the United States.
   The American political establishment is currently discussing the possibility of using the country's energy potential to protect USA interests. In practice, the strive for this has already been shown at the first stage of trade negotiations between the US and China. A similar situation is developing when the United States contacts the European Union on the issues of ousting Russian energy carriers from the European market.
   Actions of the USA in the energy market, resulting in a giant growth of production of shale hydrocarbons and expansion of their exports by early 2020, has led to a global imbalance of supply and demand of energy. This imbalance was exacerbated by global economic recession and COVID-19 pandemic, which sharply reduced demand for energy resources.
   The article also analyzes positive and negative consequences for China of the oil prices' falling. It is concluded, that the current crisis situation in the world energy sector also brings constructive opportunities due to the competition between traditional and alternative energy.

As a result of the analysis, the categories underlying the formation of the immigrant figure, illustrated by specific examples, were identified, the need for further study of the social media discourse as part of a critical discourse analysis is justified. The use of both verbal and non-verbal means in the media texts that are studied expresses the intention of the authors of the messages to use all possible communication channels when constructing an immigrant image. The results show the members of the Immigrants in EU group oppose the conflict between immigrants and indigenous people.

AB The article has been written in the framework of scientific research project Language Modeling of the Image of Russia in the Ibero-American Media and deals with the reaction of the Ibero-American media to the key foreign-policy events of 2019-2020 and the analysis of language devices of discourse strategy of melioration of the Russian external policies. Topicality of the research question is conditioned by the fact that tactics and language manipulative devices which target the mainstream audience in Spanish-speaking political discourse have been poorly studied so far. The article uses comprehensive methodology which includes both linguistic analysis (semantic, contextual and stylistic) and methods of related sciences (CDA, linguopolitical, method of comparative historic assessment) aimed at defining a positive reaction to the Russian foreign policy. The study has been conducted through the lens of the argumentation theory widely used for the analysis of various discourse practices. Among lexical devices of the discourse strategy of melioration the most frequently used ones are self-explanatory headings, evaluative language, phraseological devices, modern coinages, precedent phenomena, which form a positive image of the country and its leader. Among positive goal-oriented substantiation of evaluations are Russia's successful policies in the Middle East, selfless aid of Russia to Italy and other countries in their fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis of language devices used in Spanish-speaking readers' commentary to articles in the Ibero-American media, which interpret the Russian image in a negative way, mostly demonstrates the discourse strategy of melioration of the image of Russia and its leader.

AB The article presents a brief review of the studies of political extremism and separatism and the processes associated with them published in Russian and English over the past 10 years. In the center of the analysis is an attempt to describe the specifics and features of the dominant centers for the formation of a new academic and propaganda language that creates the content of ideas about the modern stage of separatism. The results of the study show that the current stage of the global world order and thinking form a different scale and priorities of the reasons and motives for the separatism use. The structure and significance of separatism factors and ideas about it change, but the content of power and politics and the dominant groups of influence, do not change. The separatism tension points have shifted from the traditional causes and motives for the growth of separatist sentiment to a combination of crude and veiled support for separatism and the use of its potential on a global scale by the governments of the leading countries. The process of reformatting the consciousness and politics of the supporters of separatism, who have created their own nation-states, has gained momentum.

AB Relatively recently. students of authoritarianism have not paid much attention to institutions. It was believed that since authoritarian rule is generally an arbitrariness, its institutionalism is not really important. Modern approach, however, is that institutions in authoritarian regimes are no less important than in a democracy. This is also applicable to such a political institution traditionally associated with democracy as elections. Recent works on comparative authoritarianism provide more evidence that holding election may help autocrats to survive. Starting from the third wave" of democratization, the political regimes of "electoral authoritarianism," that means regimes that are authoritarian in nature, but successfully implementing initially democratic political institutions including elections. are becoming more widespread. The regular holding of moderately competitive elections is characteristic of two the most important types of electoral authoritarianism, both hegemonic and competitive authoritarian regimes. This article attempts to generalize and systematize the conceptual views available in literature on the elections role in authoritarian regimes. Four main functions of authoritarian elections are identified and analyzed: legitimation, display of strength, co-optation and information acquisition.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE The League of Arab States (LAS); Arab-Israeli conflict; Palestinian
   issue; identity; Middle East settlement
AB The article analyzes the reasons that prompted the Arab states to consolidate their efforts and create the League of Arab States. Attention is focused on the deep differences that existed between the states that came forward with the idea of strengthening Arab unity and determined the nature of this regional organization and the features of its charter, which provided its members with the opportunity to preserve their political system, sovereignty and the specifics of foreign policy.
   The heterogeneous nature of LAS had an impact on its the goals and objectives.The focus of this organization was to protect pan-Arab interests and support all Arab states in achieving political independence.
   The aggravation of the situation in Palestine after the Second World War became a central item on the agenda of all the Arab League meetings. This organization indicated its position on the Palestinian issue in the preparatory period for its official proclamation. The article discusses the activities of the Arab League, aimed at introducing a complete boycott of Israel, which, amid expansion of the Arab League, other Arab states also joined. The Arab-Israeli conflict, due to the targeted efforts of the Arab League, consolidated the Arab geopolitical community and contributed to the formation of a national Arab identity. The LAS in its documents built a common Arab narrative, having two underpinnings: the recognition of the Palestinian Arab people as a victim of the Western powers and Zionists, as well as foreign policy of Israel.
   The article traces the relationship between the activities of the Arab League and the changes that have occurred in the regional and international environment. The gradual transition of the Arab League to the search for a political settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict was influenced by the emergence of a new balance of power in the Middle East region, as well as the gradual transformations of a new system of international relations.
   The further demarcation of the Arab countries that occurred after the mass protests in 2011 influenced the activities of the Arab League, which tried to maintain Arab unity by using the traditional tool - the unresolved Arab-Israeli conflict. The LAS member-states should have taken a pan-Arab stance on the settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict in order to preserve national identity. The refusal of all Arab League members to accept the American settlement plan, proposed by D. Trump administration in early 2020, was a confirmation that this regional organization retains its position as a defender of Arab unity and pan-Arab interests.

AB This analytical review reflects some particularly important ideas of 14 selected scientific documents and materials published in 2019 by a number of leading foreign English - speaking "think tanks" about Chinese external policy. The work aims to give the reader an idea of the views of foreign (North American, West European, Israeli and Australian) experts on the status and prospects of socio-economic development of modern China, the dynamics of its foreign policy. It also characterizes how English-speaking political scientists assess prospects for relations between China and the leading world centers of power - the USA, EU, Russia, India, etc.
   Most of the materials considered in the review testify to the undoubted interest of their authors in the phenomenon of the "rise of China" and the specifics of the international "expansion" of the PRC as a rapidly developing regional and world power and even a new superpower.
   The review shows that outside China, especially in the West and in those countries where the expert community is strongly influenced by Western political science discourse, not only critical, but often purely negative thinking has formed in relation to China, from the perspective of which internal and foreign policy of the modern leadership of the PRC and the CCP is studied.
   Acquaintance with the considered works leads to the conclusion that researchers brought up in the spirit of the Western political science school generally have a similar analytical and conceptual approach to the topic under discussion, which made it possible to prepare this review in a holistic manner. The sources for this work are represented by the materials of the specialized publication McGann, James G.

   anniversary of Japanese Empire; Nagata Hidejiro; Kono Ichiro; Kano

AB Sport occupied an important place in the ideological speculations of Japan both in the prewar and post-war periods. In the twentieth century, Tokyo twice successfully applied for the Summer Olympics. However, the Japanese government refused to support the 1940 Olympics and it did not take place. The Tokyo Olympics of 1964 won full support of the government and became the first Olympics to be held outside of Europe and America. The process of Tokyo nomination and the preparation for the Olympics sheds additional light on the political and cultural situation in pre-war and post-war Japan. A comparative analysis of the two Olympics allows us to evaluate the way that Japan had walked during the quarter of a century. During this time, Japan managed to abandon its pre-war totalitarian past and come to a radically different understanding of its place in the world.
   The Olympics is inherently an instrument of "soft power", which has come into dramatic conflict with the prevailing sentiments in the pre-war political elite, who relied on "brute force", and this led to the refusal to hold the 1940 Olympics. In present-day Japan, these failed games are commonly referred to as the "Ghost Olympics" (maboroshi no orinpikku). Instead of the "true" Olympics, the Far Eastern Games (which were informally called the "Asian Olympics") were held in 1940. In the post-war period, Japan became a peaceful country, and all her hopes were associated with "soft power". This policy allowed Japan to host the 1964 Olympics successfully and it increased country's self-esteem and international prestige. After the 1964 Olympics, the government's attention to the sport of higher achievements has been weakened and the country's prestige has been enhanced primarily through the development of the economy and science, the improvement of living standards, and the promotion of cultural achievements. The bet on soft power proved to be much more effective in ensuring Japan's rightful place in the world.

DT Article
DE Historical source; Soviet science; World War II; economic recovery;

AB The article introduces into scientific use a report of Nikolai N. Kolosovsky, founder of the Soviet local school for economic geography. It was written in 1945, in the last months of the Great Patriotic War, for a dispute held in at the Commission of the USSR Academy of Sciences on mobilizing the resources of the Urals, Western Siberia and Kazakhstan for needs of national defense. During the war, N. N. Kolosovsky supervised deployment of war industry in the Urals and solved related transport organization problems. In his report, Kolosovsky expounds his views on restoring Soviet economy in light of approaching victory. The published source captures the author's temporarily determined socio-political attitudes, as well as his professional considerations. The report was compiled several months before the beginning of the Cold War. A contains a number of references to the international cooperation of the USSR and its allies from anti-Hitler coalition. N. N. Kolosovsky does not question neither imminent assistance of the Western countries in the economic development of the postwar USSR, nor Soviet successful entry into the European market, which is subsequently to become Eurasian. The report reflects the mood of the euphoria that briefly engulfed Soviet society, soon to be destroyed by the confrontation of the two superpowers. Another valuable aspect of the report is the author's steadfast habit of looking at any given topic through the lens of further development of Soviet Eastern regions. It allowed N. N. Kolosovsky to juxtapose direct military damage caused by the Nazis to the the occupied Soviet territories and "indirect" damage caused by forced reorganization of industry of the rear regions according to wartime demands. His observations allow Kolosovsky to predict the future problems in territorial development of the USSR and to point out concrete ways for their resolution.

AB The religious grounds of Vladimir Monomakh's political views are analyzed in the article. The author reconstructs the points of the political testament of Monomakh. The main ideas of his ethic and political program are reconstructed. The Grand Duke recommended to evade sin, to be a just judge, to protect the weak, to have a mortal memory and to keep in their heart the fear of God. Actions in such paradigm imposed considerable restrictions for governors of the power because they held down them in the choice of means. The author compares the ethical and political program of Monomakh with the facts of his biography. It is shown that in real political practice Monomakh retreated from his own moral program. The author concludes that Monomakh was the first Russian leader to formulate requirements to the power itself proposing an ideal image of the Christian Prince.

   Unlocking of Potential?
SO MGIMO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Germany; Iran; Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action; Armed conflicts;
   Syria; Near East
AB The article explores the current relations between Germany and Iran in politicalmilitary sphere. Both countries belong to the category of emerging powers (the Germany is perhaps the single emerging power among Euro-Atlantic states). Outlining the contours of bilateral relations, the authors underline the presence of imperial historical code in each country, the growing internal political problems (dwindling authority of the ruling elites) and mutual interest in deepening trade-industrial partnership with Germany becoming a technological modernizer of Iranian economy.
   The authors show that Iranian factor has a growing impact over German policy in the Near East and the Middle East, especially in Lebanese, Syrian, Iraqi and Yemeni armed conflicts. In the first three cases Germany tries to limit the scale, the character (non-combatant capabilities), geographic area (not in deep regions) of the Bundeswehr usage. One of the key reasons of it is that Germany avoids being drawn into action against the Iranian troops or its junior allies ("Hezbollahy", in Lebanon, Shia combatants in Southern Iraq). Germany also recognizes that ignoring Iranian interests in each of these cases will make it difficult to maintain its political-military presence in the region. Because of the Yemen conflict with active participation of Saudi Arabia Germany has imposed arms embargo for the Kingdom.
   Germany attempted to keep the Iranian nuclear deal after Trump's administration withdrawal from the agreement. The authors try to estimate the probable position of Germany towards possible military-political crisis in the region involving Iran and especially towards a potential US war against Iran.
   What result will Germany strive for in the Iranian direction? According to the authors, this is a significantly expanded formula of 2015. In addition to maintaining the JCPQA and mutually beneficial growth in trade and economic cooperation, this formula includes:
   - minimizing the threat of a military conflict against Iran (which has become especially important after the assassination of General Qasem Soleimani on January 3, 2020);
   - in exchange for this clear limitation of Iran's influence in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen.

DE Procedures unit; Justice Court; punitive court of Iran; clash of laws;

AB The principle of respecting the separation of political forces in a society gives the legal system the right to issue orders on people's complaints based on the laws approved by the legislative power. There is no question that laws, like other man-made things, have shortcomings. These decisions include the rupture and even the conflict between two or more articles of the law that provoke the creation of different policies in the court of justice and the punitive court of Iran. With a documentary methodology, this article attempts to study the conflicts between different punitive laws and their effect on the creation of different policies in the courts of Iran. It is concluded that, in many cases, due to different reasons there may be defects in the law or in the interpretation of the law that generate defect, ambiguity, clash between laws and contradiction. The existence of all these failures in different cases will cause conflicts between the judges of the criminal courts and these conflicts are the source of the creation of different legal procedures in the criminal courts and in the short time analyzed.

The reception of Western corporate norms is, as it seems from comparative analysis, not an easy-going process in neither of the jurisdictions. State-owned enterprises, which play significant role both in China and Russia have their separate challenges, i.g. an 'absent owner' problem and the lack of minority shareholders' rights protection. Such institutes as independent directors, disinterested directors, cumulative voting on elections of the Board members are compared and analysed.

The purpose of the research is to formulate a general definition of the socio-philosophical concept of national security. In this concept, the education system occupies an important position, since it ensures the quality of human preparation for a decent life in a healthy society, and also forms the intellectual and practical potential of the country's population, which can ensure all aspects of the national security of our society. The development of this concept will allow us to form a complete picture of the country's national security by creatively integrating the achievements of specific national security Sciences - military, state-political, economic, legal, as well as education security that has not yet been specifically identified.

AB The article examines China's global position in the modern world and its development prospects in the XXI century. The author analyzes the role of China in the global economy, where the country intends to play a more significant role, since it has a huge potential, able to make a vast impact on global political and economic processes. This is evidenced by China's "Belt and Road" or "One belt, One road" initiative, among key goals of which is to deploy the globalization of the world economy under the aegis of Beijing. In addition, the article analyzes probable ways to improve the "hard power" of the PRC, and describes challenges and risks for Russia in its interaction with China.
   The author points out, that China in its development seeks not only to strengthen economic leadership in the current century, but also to acquire the role of a truly global political force. However, the main obstacle hindering China's ambitions is the ambivalent perception of the PRC by the West. From the economic point of view, China is perceived by the world market community as a "friendly one", and from the political point of view China is "alien", since the country retains the monopoly of the CPC in the socio-ideological sphere. At the same time, Beijing's strategic activity has crossed the national borders of the PRC, which, due to its intensive economic expansion, has become a participant in the redistribution of spheres of global influence in its favor, displacing rival actors from those regions of the world where they until recently dominated. To achieve the general goal of becoming the world's leading economic power, the country under the leadership of Xi Jinping is implementing a number of important auxiliary tasks, including: expanding external markets for Chinese products and finding new commercial partners and sources of raw materials; export of high-quality high-tech products and improving the standard of living of Chinese citizens on the basis of accelerating national economic growth. Principal components of this strategy are: agrarian reform, granting farmers broad rights to use land that is still not subject to sale; encouraging private entrepreneurship, especially in trade and services; attracting foreign capital and developing export production; creating special economic (export) zones with high production infrastructure and tax benefits, etc.

AB Although much attention has been attached to the role of strategies and tactics in understanding the nature of political communication, the methodology and the metalanguage of this approach have not received all the attention they deserve. Having chosen integrity strategy as an object of analyses, the author considers its realization in terms of the three-level method, which proved to be effective in establishing the interrelationship between the global purport of the text and linguistic means of its expression. The paper presents the results of comparative analysis of public speeches of the two American presidents, B. Obama and D. Trump. The author argues that on the semantic level integrity strategy is mainly realized by means of stylistically neutral nouns related to the basic American cultural values. The metasemiotic content (a positive image of the United States as a superior country) is created by a limited number of stereotyped rhetorical devices, the most typical of which is based on semantic proximity of speech units. The content and the expression plane of these units serve to create the meta-meta-message which consists in the idea of America's political dominance. The author reveals invariable and variable features in the speeches of the two politicians and comes to the conclusion that in his attempt to ensure integrity of American citizens, D.Trump, apart from the tactics of inspiration and uniting, makes extensive use of accusation and critics of political opponents, which is mainly achieved through the rhetorical device of synonymic condensation.

ID DISCOURSE
AB The article is devoted to assessing the state of Russian soft power. The author was prompted to address this topic by a contradiction. On the one hand, a review of the scientific literature shows that experts appreciate the level of development ot' Russia's soft power in the near abroad. On the other hand, international political analysts state that the CIS States have chosen one or another form of multi-vector activity in the international arena, and Moscow's influence in the post-Soviet space has been declining in the past few years. Based on a Grounded theory developed by A. Strauss and J. Corbin, which analyzed the policy documents of political parties that passed national parliaments, the author comes to a number of conclusions. The attitude of party and political elites to Russia differs from one country to another and is inversely dependent on the attitude to the EU. When assessing the impact of Russia's soft power, it is necessary to follow an "individual" (country) approach rather than a region-wide one.

Of the materials included in the book, the most interesting is the article by Professor Josip Badalich, which briefly describes the history of the creation of this monument The translation of this particular text is presented. For researchers of the history of socio-political thought, his article is interesting not only by mentioning the name of L.N. Tolstoy in a certain historical context, but also because Tolstoyism is interpreted as a manifestation of Slavophilism and Pan-Slavism, and these very concepts are used by Badalich as synonyms.

TI BUREAUCRACY OF POWER AND OF THE POWER BUREAUCRACY. REVIEW ON THE
   COLLECTION OF ESSAYS BY V.P. MAKARENKO
SO SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS
LA Russian
DT Review
AB This is the review of the three-volume book by V.P. Makarenko, the author of over 500 works, Doctor of Philosophy and Political Sciences. Professor, Honored Scientist of the Russian Fedora-tion, Academician of the Academy of Pedagogical Sciences of Ukraine, Chief Researcher, Head of the Center for Political Conceptology of the Institute of Philosophy, Social and Political Sciences of the Southern Federal university. This is the work of a person who devoted his life to the study of socio-political processes taking place before his eyes, which required understanding from the point of view of time, history, and civilization.
   This collection comprises essays written from 1980s to 2010s. The author included them to illus-trate his cross-cutting idea of the relationship between power, bureaucracy and society. The au-thor's successes and failures are also noted. V.P. Makarenko understands bureaucracy as a 'trans-conned form of expression of universal interests'. a social organism-parasite throughout its his-torical existence, reflection of social contradictions and conflicts. materialization of political and managerial alienation. The methodological thought of Makarenko is devoted to the explanation of this phenomenon. whose task is to develop his own concept and destroy long-term myths about bureaucracy as an example of 'rational management of society'.
   Makarenko proceeds from the difference between name and description and on this basis de-scribes bureaucratic ontology, epistemology and axiology. V.P. Malcarenko's concept of bureau-cracy can be understood as a version of a theory that can fall under the status of error (according to K. Popper's theory). It implies the transformation of the common good as an ideal idea into an embodied common evil, a particular case of which is civilization and any power. The errors of various theories of state structures, relations and power are also described. The bureaucratic state created by Lenin and Stalin is a formally developed system of total lies, the consequences and incarnations of which still exist in Russia.

DT Article
DE Russian epistolary; Vasily Zhukovsky; Friedrich Wilhelm von Schadow;
   religious painting; Romanticism
AB The article presents, for the first time, an attempt to reconstruct the context and the object of creative contacts of Vasily Zhukovsky and Friedrich Wilhelm von Schadow (1788-1862), a theorist of painting and head of the Academy of Arts in Dusseldorf. The sources for the reconstruction were the previously unpublished eight letters by the German artist written in the period from 1838 to 1846 and now stored in the Manuscript Department of the Institute of Russian Literature and materials from the creative heritage of the Russian poet and artist. The article establishes new facts about the institutional role of Zhukovsky in the Russian-German cultural ties in the 19th century. Von Schadow gave some of his paintings in the original, in copies or prints for Zhukovsky' s personal collection and for the imperial collection of the future Hermitage. The list of these paintings is, for the first time, compiled in the article. The textual material is illustrated with images from von Schadow's works discussed in the epistolary dialogue. Von Schadow's published manifestos on the theory and criticism of Christian religious painting, which Zhukovsky read and which influenced his artistic worldview in the 1840s, are attributed. The article presents, for the first time, the most significant fragments from von Schadow's letters of 1838-1845 translated into Russian. The fragments fill in the gaps in the objective representation of the scale of Zhukovsky' s activities at court on compiling a collection of Russian paintings both in the institutional and ideological artistic aspects. At the same time, the communication between the German artist and the Russian poet found reflection in Zhukovsky's creative heritage of the late period: in his criticism, works on art theory, prose, and reflections. Von Schadow, in his last letters, and Zhukovsky, in his diary entries, pay special attention to reflections on pedagogical activities and works on the theory of fine arts, as well as on their social and political activities. The parable of the prodigal son was the fmal touch in the creative dialogue of the poet and the artist. Zhukovsky reflected this parable in his unfinished poem about the Wandering Jew. The lines of the poem paint in words fragments from the Sacred History quite in the spirit of von Schadow's paintings: Zhukovsky compares the Wandering Jew who ascended Calvary with the prodigal son and depicts the holistic canvas of the inner and outer space of the character through his eyes. The conclusion is made that the discovered letters from von Schadow to Zhukovsky reveal the adherence of the both to the lofty romantic idea of a synthesis of arts based on the poetics of heartfelt feelings, artistic imagination, active teaching, and religious and mystical experience. Fine arts, science and history, issues of faith and politics of the mid-19th century were a background for the concentration of the correspondents on the rethinking of substantial religious and philosophical issues on the material of eternal biblical plots on the entombment of Christ, taking Christ down from the cross, on reasonable and unreasonable maidens, and, finally, on two parables about the lost sheep and the prodigal son, which became the ultimate embodiment of the dialogue of a poet and an artist in fine arts.

AB Based on a review of publications about the development of social science in Greece this article discusses social and political factors which impact the development of Greece sociology. The methodology comprises a review of the scientific articles as well as the websites of research institutions and associations of Greece sociologists. Until recently, there has been little research on Greek sociology conducted in Russia. However, the set of translated publications revealed that the problems discussed by the Greek sociologists coincide directly with the ones of their counterparts' in Europe, including Russia. Research studies by Greek sociologists are frequently published, research activities are represented in European sociological associations. The fact that some Greek sociological journals were established in the first half of the 20th century indicates the scope of studies and an academic nature of Greek sociology. The content-analysis of articles and websites of research institutes, as well as analysis of political and social discourses, have resulted in the understanding of social problems relevant to modern Greek society. The purpose of this article is to examine major dimensions of modern Greek sociology, social situation in the Greek society, therefore to complement the overall picture of European sociological paradigm.

DE Great Britain; Members of Parliament; parliament; immigrants; political

ID SUCCESS
AB The share of parliamentarians of non-European origin in the parliaments of Western Europe is steadily increasing given mass immigration in the recent decades. Studying distinguishing features of the political behavior of immigrants is becoming particularly relevant. Does the expansion of the representation of ethnic minorities in the highest authorities lead to the radicalization of their demands or, on the contrary, stimulate integration into the host community? In order to answer this question, the author turns to the experience of Great Britain, which has more than a century-long history of the presence of immigrants among its parliamentarians (MPs).
   Having carefully analyzed the life trajectories of British MPs of non-European descent since their first appearance in the House of Commons, the author reveals a clear tendency that the share of particularists, those focused on aggressively defending the narrow interests of their own ethnic group or immigrant communities per se, was decreasing, while the number of generalists, who position themselves as Britons and aim to represent all their constituents, regardless of their race, ethnicity or religion, was increasing. While back in 1987, particularists and radicals constituted 100% of all non-white parliamentarians in the English Parliament, in 2017 they constituted only 8%. His research suggests that increasing the participation of immigrants in the political life of their new homeland helps to weaken group thinking and reduce demand for particularist policy.

Based on the analysis of modern literature, the author comes to the conclusion that the reason for which, for a significant amount of time, the limits of constitutional regulation were not the subject of scientific research is the politicization of the categorical-conceptual apparatus, its variability and dependence on the ideology of the elite. According to the author, it is now possible to observe in Russia an increasing politicization of constitutional law. This cannot but influence the expansion of its sphere, which in this historical period of time includes a fairly wide range of relations that are of fundamental importance for a country - the underlying relations and ties that define the foundations of the constitutional system, the relationships that define the basis of the legal status of a person and citizen, his rights, freedoms and obligations, the relations that determine the order of interaction for federal bodies of state power with the bodies of state power of the subjects of the Russian Federation, and the relations that define the basis of the legal situation of the state bodies and relationships that specify the principles of local self-government in the Russian Federation. Recognizing the opinions of scholars based on the theoretical dogmas of representatives of legal science, the article proposes to expand the content of this concept by incorporating the distinctive features of constitutional regulation, describing their role (purpose) in the process of constitutional regulation.

AB The relevance of the research is determined not only by the centenary of the Russian revolution and global political instability, but also by the attempts of overcoming the academic science's dependence from the government propaganda. Purpose of the research is to analyze the driving forces of the revolution of 1917 and causes of the Bolsheviks' victory. Research methods: The author uses the dialectics, positivism, principle of historicism, and deconstructivism in the paper. The selection of methods was due to avoiding party and political impact. Marxism was in use in the field of the terms like the masses, classes. Research results The study analyzed actions of social groups and individuals like townsfolk, soldiers and sailors, representatives of all-Russian and regional governing bodies. The paper provides a brief characteristics of the problem's historiography. Th author proposes new explanation to the causes of the rise of the Bolsheviks popularity in late 1917. Practical relevance lies in the fact that this study explains meaningful and unconscious actions of the government towards possible prevention of revolutionary bursts in future.

DT Article
DE European Union; Syria; migration crisis; refugees; international aid;
   Brussels conferences; reconstruction; sanctions
AB The war in Syria, which broke out in 2011, turned this Middle Eastern country into a major hotbed of instability across Europe's southern borders. To date, the European Union and its member states have been key donors of humanitarian assistance to Syrian refugees and provided limited non-humanitarian assistance to areas controlled by the opposition. At the same time, the EU has imposed and maintained strict sanctions against the Assad government and denied any support for reconstruction of the Damascus-controlled areas pending the political transition. The growing disagreements among member states and a rapidly changing political landscape on the ground in Syria in favor of the Assad government may hypothetically lead to a transformation of the EU position. However, for the European Union to develop a viable approach that reflects new realities will require solving some very complex political dilemmas. European politicians found themselves in a difficult situation - they do not want to legitimise the Assad government by funding reconstruction, however they cannot ignore the humanitarian situation in the country and their interests in the field of security and migration.

AB An interview by Grigoriy Konson with Artem R. Oganov, PhD, FRSC MAE, Professor at the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, Professor at the Russian Academy of Sciences, is devoted to crystallography-the science of solid crystalline substances surrounding us, containing an ordered periodic system of atomic positions. Crystallography is at the forefront of the science of matter. It contributed to proving the atomistic hypothesis, which dates back to antiquity. This field of science enables studies of the world around us, and can lead to the creation of new materials with unique properties. Its methods helped to understand the structure and function of proteins, how living matter works-DNA and heredity, enzymes, hemoglobin, the working of drugs. In the interview, not only the structure of crystals is discussed, but also their laws, the correlation between the structure of a material and its properties, the possibility of selecting substances for various applications, the construction of new materials on the computer, which in fact leads to the creation of a new reality. This is facilitated by studying how the structure of crystalline substances behaves at high pressures, the conditions prevailing in the interior of the planet. Analyzing matter under pressure helps to explore the interiors of our and other planets, as well as the processes occurring within them. At the same time, predicting previously unknown crystalline substances is a new thing in crystallography-and until recently was considered impossible.
   Tracing the origins of crystallography, the scientist proceeds from the phenomenon of symmetry in living nature (often used in their art by the Sumerians, especially mirror symmetry), which found its vivid manifestation in regular polyhedra called Platonic solids. In 360 BC, Plato described these polyhedra in his dialogue Timaeus and compared them with all the known "elements"-fire, air, water and earth. Studying crystallography, the scientist finds parallels in art, giving examples of non-trivial patterns of Islamic artists and contemporary ones, such as Escher's. In the context of this topic, the interview also addresses a number of more general issues related to the development of science in the modern world (through the example of models adopted in the USA, China, and Russia).

AB Relevance is determined by the riskogennostju social, political, economic, social and cultural living conditions of Russians, growing uncertainty, fragmenarnostju the functioning of many social institutions. Relevance also lies in the intensity of the negative development orientations of youth as a result of the socio-economic changes and the growing public controversy, resulting in loss of life smysloobrazujushhih ideals, loss of confidence, changing values in public and individual consciousness. The problem of trust/distrust of youth to social agents, personal safety, self-actualization become relevant. Aggressive behaviour becomes the norm of the time. The role of trust as one of the most important factors in the implementation of dialogue in society. Prerequisites for the actualization of the destructive problems are complex and diverse in many respects, part of the Russian society and the socio-economic and political contradictions. The novelty is that the necessity of an interdisciplinary approach in the study of the phenomenon of "trust"; on the basis of a theoretical and comparative analysis of the factors forming confidence as conditions for social dialogue shows that supports socio-cultural situation in the society. Category "trust/distrust" appeared to be integrative, structural and properties of multicomponent, developing and undergoes a transformation.

AB Since the 19th century - the period of the destruction of the traditional way of life, urbanization, mass migration, the formation of new directions and entire scientific disciplines - the city and society have become objects of close study of representatives of existing and newly emerging areas of science. "Community" is becoming one of the most popular concept of sociological language. Communities are considered in the context of urban development. The foundations of occurrence, modern understanding and significance for participants in urban communities are revealed. The object of the study is the global community of young people, acting in the city of Tomsk as an initiative of the World Economic Forum. The subject is the grounds for the formation and reasons for young people to enter the community. The subject is the grounds for the formation and reasons for young people to enter the community. The urban community is considered as a significant agent in complex processes (economic, political, social, cultural, etc.), in which today, without exception, all city residents are involved. Important facts highlighted for studying the phenomenon of urban communities.

AB All that man needs for his existence come from the natural environment. Advanced modern technologies often only increase the consumption of natural resources, since the material benefits produced by human labor are made from them. As a natural resource, land is a unique and most valuable source that forms the basis of life and activity for all humankind. All the processes of establishing a human society, which take place in the social, political, economic, communal, industrial and environmental spheres, are directly linked to land resources. This issue is of ongoing global concern. Therefore, the activities of any state must, first and foremost, be aimed at their effective management and protection from the negative impact of natural factors and consequences of human activity.

AB The article refers to the problem of the ruling aristocratic groups in Dagestan in the first half of the XIX century. The attention is paid to the issues related to the relations of representatives of the mountain nobility with the Russian military administration and with the structures of Muslim statehood (Imamate) in the specified period. The opus presents the results of an analysis of military-political events during which the region became part of the Russian Empire. Particular (Special) attention is paid to the issue of the struggle for power and the subsequent change of traditional power groups in Dagestan. It is concluded that this process took place not only under the pressure of Russian military officials who doubted the loyalty of the mountain aristocracy, but also due to the fact that only a few of the representatives of nobility were able to integrate into the new system of power relations within the framework of the Imamate. The question also arises of the degree of influence of individual owners and their relatives on the genesis of the Imamate and its further functioning, including the extent to which their actions contributed to the spread of the ideas of muridism in Dagestan and Chechnya. The novelty of the study is seen in an attempt to present these events using the terminological apparatus adequate to describe the Islamic society. The work is relevance due to the acute controversy taking place in the scientific community on the role of individual historical figures in these events and ambiguous interpretations of their heritage. All this is analyzed on the basis of a system-historical approach, using the achievements of social science and attracting a wide range of material, including unpublished archival sources.

AB The paradigm of multiculturalism, which had been largely recognised by both academic and political circles in the last third of the 20th century, is in crisis and requires either rethinking or replacement by another model; this could combine the virtues of multiculturalism in supporting cultural diversity with the need to consolidate society. The article analyzes the advantages of a new paradigm of diversity management known as "interculturalism", and provides an overview of intercultural policies and practices through the example of the province of Quebec and the Council of Europe's Intercultural cities program. The article focuses primarily on the possibility of implementing the latter model in Russia in order to regulate ethnopolitical relations. It is argued that the conception of the Russian "nationalities policy" could benefit from the including elements of the concepts and methodologies of intercultural policies and practices. Although the article highlights the existing limits in regard to the application of interculturalism in the Russian context, it also points to the substantial convergence of ethnopolitical trends in Russia and other Global North countries. The present article draws on the results of the research project "New approaches and methods of regulation of ethnopolitical relations on the territory of the largest urban agglomerations of Russia", and particularly on the sociological data from three Russian million-cities (Perm, Rostov-on-Don and Ufa). Each case is scrutinized with regard to practices of mutual accommodation deployed by different ethnic communities.

DT Article; Book Chapter
DE Christianity in Korea; Christian Church; Catholicism; Protestantism;
   Christian theology of liberation "Minjun"
AB The split of Korea and the Korean War contributed to the numerical growth of the Korean Christians. It is no accident that the first South Korean government, headed by Rhee Syngman, included 40 % of Christians. During that time the Christian Church became close to power and actively supported his policies, thus continuing the old Japanese colonial tradition of successful integration of the Christian community into state structures.
   However, everything changed after the military coup of 1961, when Park Chung-hee illegitimately came to power in South Korea. Some Christians decided to fight against the authoritarian regime, having managed not only to create a network of their organizations for resistance, but also to organize their original religious doctrine "Minjun" ("theology of the liberation of the people"), contrasting it with the official rhetoric that covered the lawless acts with the mythical interests of the entire nation ("minjok").
   Christians not only made a significant contribution to the formation of the ideology of today's ruling elite, but during the period of military authoritarian regimes in power, they actively fought for democratic rights and freedoms, without losing sight of the problems of national unification. Today, the Korean Church is not only an important part of the Korean national tradition and culture, but it also continues to play an important role in the political life of South Korea.

AB Introduction. The article is devoted to the problematization and conceptualization of influence, as well as the potential for participation of higher education institutions, as educational and scientific centers, in the formation and implementation of gender and sexual policies in modern European countries, which are widely debated and ambiguously perceived in society. Methods. The article conceptualizes the concepts of gender and sexual policy in two senses: as a sphere of the struggle for power, as well as a system of technologies and actions in solving socially important problems. As a theoretical and methodological framework, the principles of social constructionism are used in interpreting the content, meaning and research of technologies for the formation of public representations and culture on issues of intimate and inter-sexual relations. Based on the use of general scientific methods and the heuristic potential of the Overton window concept, a scheme is proposed for explaining and studying the participation of universities in the "promotion" of relevant policies and politics. Results. The heuristic potential of the concept of "Overton's Window" to the political science problematization, interpretation and explanation of the "soft power" potential of modern universities in shaping, discussing the social and political agenda on sexual and gender culture in Europe is revealed. It is shown that sexual and gender policies in society can be aimed at changing the values, perceptions and norms of the organization of interactions in the relevant areas of life, both at the level of individual practices and social institutions. Social and communicative technologies (informed discussion, events, creation of terms, name-calling) that are (un) intentionally used in the framework of higher education institutions to normalize and politicize ideas, perceptions and values regarding gender issues, the organization of sexual life can be interpreted as important tools for transforming unthinkable practices and beliefs into the category of not only acceptable, eligible on the existence of a pluralism of views, but also dominant in political discourse. Discussion. The issue of the ethical principles of the implementation of the "soft power" strategy by European universities, as well as the political and social sense and consequences of radical transformations in gender and sexual culture and the structure of society, present in the discourses of European academic science and education, remains open and poorly studied.

DE Church Councils; Council of Constance; Council of Basel; Church Union;
   Byzantium; Poland; Lithuania; Teutonic Order; Holy Roman Empire
AB Introduction. The article is aimed at studying the negotiations on the Greek-Latin Church Union at the Church Councils in Constance (1414-1418) and Basel (1431-1449), which were the predecessors of the Council of Ferrara-Florence (1438-1439) in this matter. Since they were generated by internal processes in the Latin West, they originally had not direct relationship to Byzantium. Methods and materials. The reason for the appeal of Councils to the problem of the Church Union should be sought in the field of Western international policy. It acted here as a tool for solving political problems by different actors. Analysis. At the Council of Constance the discussion of the Greek-Latin Union was initiated by Poland and Lithuania, who used it as a means of political propaganda against the Teutonic Order. The Council of Basel subsequently entered into direct negotiations with Byzantium. The reason for this was at first internecine strife in the Duchy of Lithuania, which interfered with Poland, the Teutonic Order and King Sigismund. The Council initiated consideration of the Church Union in order to support the Lithuanian Duke Svitrigaila in the struggle for the throne. As a result Byzantium was included also in the negotiations with the Council of Basel. But in 1435 Svitrigaila was defeated in the clash with Poland and its ally Duke Sigismund Kestutaitis. This defeat undermined the influence of Sigismund of Luxembourg at the Council of Basel. The King began his rapprochement with the Pope and Venice, and the Council of Basel was influenced by their political rivals, such as Milan and France. The theme of the Church Union at the Council became an instrument of struggle for political interests between these groups of political subjects. As a result, the struggle led to sharp disputes over the choice of the place for the Greek-Latin Council. The main options were Italy and French Avignon. The Byzantines chose the first option. But Byzantium was not the subject of the policy that created the situation of this choice. In the West this policy has led to significant changes. Results. The results of the negotiations on the Church Union at the Council of Basel displayed the fall of the role of imperial policy in the Latin West, which was represented by the King and Emperor Sigismund Luxembourg. The Empire was losing control of Italy. The result was the withdrawal of the papacy from its influence and the strengthening of Venice. Their union stood behind the Council of Ferrara-Florence. Outside Italy this Council has not received recognition.

AB The article is devoted to the study of the formal legal and actual status of the (State) Chairman of the PRC in the state mechanism. Attention is the (State) Chairman is not the head of state (chief of state). According to the Constitution of the PRC, the head of state (chief of state) is the National People's Congress. The (State) Chairman of the PRC is only the executive and administrative organ under him. The National People's Congress to elects all the highest authorities, including the (State) Chairman of the PRC, the Premier of the State Council, the Chairman of the Central Military Commission, the Chairman of the National Supervisory Commission, the Chairman of the Supreme People's Court, the Chairman of the Supreme People's Procuratorate and others. The National People's Congress has the right to remove them from their posts.
   According to the first Constitution of the PRC of 1954, the head of state (chief of state) was a collegial organ represented by the NPC and the (State) Chairman of the PRC. However, the role of the chairman of the state in political processes of that time was invisible. In 1968, the (State) Chairman of the PRC Liu Shaoqi was declared to be removed from chairmanship by the CCP by unconstitutional means. The Constitution of the PRC of 1975 (the period of the "cultural revolution") abolished the post of the (State) Chairman. He was not even in the Constitution of 1978. Only the 1982 Constitution restored the (State) Chairman of the PRC to the system of higher government authorities and administration (the office of state chairman was not re-installed until a fourth Constitution was made in 1982). The powers of the (State) Chairman are extremely limited and he acts mainly in accordance with the decisions of the NPC. In fact (not legally) the head of state (chief of state) is the General Secretary of the CPC, the head of the ruling Communist Party, which determines the direction of the country's development as a whole. The post of the (State) Chairman of the PRC is formal and not important in the political system of China.

AB The article is devoted to the study of the features of legal regulation of the electoral system in modern Chinese state. The article analyzes the basic principles of the electoral system, the mechanism of recall of deputy, discusses the current regulatory legal acts regulating for elections to China's public authority (the people's congress system or the People's Republic of China). The China's electoral system is based on an indirect (electoral choice) and direct (popular choice) elections. Highest agency of State power - the National People's Congress - is elected in-directly. The National People's Congress is composed of deputies elected from the provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government and of deputies elected from the armed forces. Deputies to the people's congresses of provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government, cities divided into districts and autonomous prefectures are also elected (indirect election means deputies to the people's congresses at the next higher level are elected by deputies to the people's congresses at the next lower level). Deputies to the people's congresses of counties, cities not divided into districts, municipal districts, townships, nationality townships and towns are elected directly by their constituencies (popular choice).
   The basis of the electoral system of the PRC were created in the period of the China's sovet districts and the Chinese Soviet Republic. After founded the People's Republic of China in 1949, the electoral system was regulated in the first Constitution of the PRC (1954) and some other legal acts. However, during various destructive political campaigns, especially during the "cultural revolution", there were no parliamentary elections in country, the electoral system was destroyed. For the adoption of the Constitution 1975 in violation of electoral legislation, the deputies of the NPC session were not elected, but appointed by the "revolutionary committees". Only after the end of the "cultural revolution" and the beginning of the "policy of reform and openness" the electoral system begin to recover on the principles and rules laid down in the early years of the PRC.
   The election legislation adopted in the years of reform and openness in a slightly modified form continues to exist to the present time. The country's population participates in elections only at the county level. At a higher level, the population does not participate in elections. This allows the Chinese Communist Party to tightly and totally control the electoral process, opposition cannot get into people's congress system. The Chinese Communist Party is not interested in giving up its monopoly on political power to experiment with multiparty democratic competition.

AB When describing the history of twentieth-century Russian architecture, it is common to separate (and even oppose) the pre-revolutionary decades and the early Soviet period of the 1920s. Thus, the revolutionary months of 1917 proper have been completely overlooked by researchers as unworthy and capable of shaking the existing historiographical model. Such an approach, dictated by ideological considerations, is no longer justified today and requires revision. The study of periodicals of the second half of the 1910s and archival materials, a great number of which have not been introduced into academic circulation, convince us that the years of the First World War and the revolution were marked by significant changes in the minds of architects. Many things which had previously seemed fundamental for the collective identity of architects became subject to problematisation, and aesthetic categories were replaced by political criteria in the professional press. The architectural process started to be described by its participants in terms of struggle, while the self-identification of members of the architectural corporation lay between the search for survival tactics and taking part in the transformation of the country's inner life. The novelty of the data presented in this article is due to the virtual absence of special studies devoted to this extremely important period in twentieth-century Russian architectural history.

AB Taiwan, a former colony of Japan (1895-1945), due to a host of different factors, still remains one of the few regions that doesn't place an emphasis on the negative sides of a rather long period of colonial rule. Though the problems of the historical past do not have a great impact on developing the traditionally close relations between Japan and Taiwan, they play an important role in forming the "Taiwanese identity" and are closely related to current issues of foreign and domestic policy of the Republic of China. The still ongoing feud between Mainland China and Taiwan, coupled with the current international political situation, in their turn, also have an effect on the evaluations of the colonial past, the policy of the Japanese Empire in the first part of the 20th century, and the perception of contemporary Japan in Taiwan.
   The article discusses approaches of Taiwanese authorities to problems of the historical past under president Ma Yingjiu (2008-2016) - the period when Kuomintang built up similarly good relations with Japan and China on the basis of a new conception of "Taiwanese identity". Making an effort to harmonize pro-unification and pro-independence parties, the president tried to form in Taiwanese society a balanced approach to understanding the Japanese and Chinese periods of Taiwanese history, as well as the role of Japan in the formation of the modern Republic of China. Calling himself "the best friend of Japan", Ma Yingjiu continued to strengthen ties between Tokyo and Taipei, and, at the same time, pursued a hard line in the territorial dispute with Japan - the question of sovereignty over Diaoyudao Senkaku islands (or Diaoyutai islands... as they are called in Taiwan), which reappeared on the agenda of relations between Japan and Taiwan. However, problems of the historical past in the Ma Yingjiu era did not hamper the development of cooperation between Tokyo and Taipei, while the image of Japan remained constantly positive.

AB The UN has played an important but controversial role in inter/Korean relations over the past decades, from the beginning of the Korean War to the present, when the UN Security Council is discussing the possibility of easing and lifting sanctions against the DPRK depending on progress on the US/North Korean denuclearization talks.
   The Korean War was the first serious test of strength for the newly created United Nations victorious powers. In the context of the outbreak of the Cold War, the great powers, having rejected their mutual promises, experienced a great temptation to act exclusively in the name of their interests and ambitions, to the detriment of the logic of compromise and collective action. With the outbreak of war in Korea in 1950, the imperfection of the UN Charter and other norms of international law in the event of an open confrontation of the interests of superpowers became especially apparent.
   The lessons of multilateral diplomacy around inter/Korean relations within the UN are more relevant than ever. Today, the UN needs a scientific and political "audit" of the experience of its participation in the Korean War and subsequent attempts to resolve the situation on the Korean Peninsula.

DE Actor-Net Theory; translation of interests; social constructivism;
   highenergy physics; international cooperation
AB Actor-Net Theory (ANT) as one of the leading directions in science and technology studies (STS) is a group of approaches based on the works of Bruno Latour. Most often, the main thesis of ANT is considered the claim that non-human actors act as participants of interactions equal to people. The notion of the active role of non-human actors constitutes a fundamental difference between ANT and the early social constructivist approaches that limit the construction of facts to sociality as specifically human. In this paper, we examine the history of international scientific cooperation in high-energy physics, which arose in the 1970s-1980s between the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (Dubna) and the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (USA) in connection with experimental studies of small-angle proton scattering on protons, in the framework of ANT. We show that the experiments under discussion can be represented as a network of heterogeneous actors in which mutual translations of epistemic and political interests occur, and any clear division into context and content cannot be established.

AB The proposed study is devoted to Chinese policy towards Venezuela in the 21st century. It is noted that the modern leadership of the PRC pays great attention to expanding relations with the countries of Latin America. Venezuela is one of the world leaders in oil reserves. China is interested in gaining access to those oil reserves, considering Venezuela as one of the leading areas of its energy diplomacy. It has been determined that in achieving its goals, China builds relations not only with the official regime, but also with representatives of the Venezuelan opposition. The paper gives a characteristic of the specifics of the bilateral relations development at the present stage, and identifies priority areas of interaction. Since the beginning of the 21st century, China has become a leading lender of major economic and social projects and programs in Venezuela. The result of this policy was a marked increase in the influence of China on the economy of Venezuela. Strengthening the position of China in Venezuela is carried out in various ways. In recent years, China has diversified its presence in Venezuela; the parties began to actively develop military-technical cooperation and expand intercultural dialogue, paying attention to the field of education, science and culture. Relations between China and Venezuela are mutually beneficial. China is strengthening its position in the international arena, and Venezuela is receiving guarantees of political stability in the state and in the Latin American region.

DT Article
DE education; Antiquity: Cicero; ecophilosophy; care of the self
AB In the writings of the Ancient Roman philosopher, politician and orator Mark Tullius Cicero, the necessity to relate the nature of statehood, the nature of man, the nature of law, and the nature of society becomes a pedagogical principle, on the basis of which the philosophy of education should be built. Cicero advances an original concept of education as an institution which protects both the state and the person. Thus, he actually forms the area that we now call the ecophilosophy of education. Cicero is close to Socrates' pedagogy with its need to take care of the self through education in the city, which lives an active political life and represents a small-scale copy of the world. Reasoning upon this in On the Nature of the Gods and the Tusculan disputations, Cicero outlines two strategies of educational care of the self for those who are directly involved in the political life of Rome, and for those who have deliberately retreated from the city and preferred scholarly leisure to politics. Praising Socrates for making philosophy useful for the city, Cicero is eager to do the same with the philosophy of education. His initial message is that a person is not born with full knowledge of his surrounding and inner nature; he is only able to acquire this knowledge through education. Cicero's legacy is an experience of an ecophilosophical interpretation of modern education, which he views simultaneously as a necessity, a need and a duty to carefully create himself through others.

There is no doubt that the declared medical danger of the phenomenon is very uncertain, repeatedly overestimated and used to hack and rebuild the Global economy to push the "pre-digital" world into the digital age. In fact, conversations about the prospects of the digital age have ended, and the society has been confronted with new spatial-temporal, socio-cultural and political realities and conditions. Now all that remains is to monitor the process and adjust it as much as possible.
   The article touches upon the issue of the impact of the pandemic and, more importantly, the impact of the measures taken on the state and development of the China's digital economy.

AB The article examines the interconnection among different political and economic factors accounting for the degree of security of Russia's statehood from external and internal threats at the current stage of its development. The focus is made on the interrelation between political and technological factors, as well as on the assessment of its role in the national security system. Attention is paid to the views of the modern Russian state on national security in relation to science and technologies. The widespread adoption of digital technologies in Russia's economy leads to a variety of complex changes in the political sphere and in the system of political relations in society. In particular, this entails changes in the forms and models of political interaction. Naturally and logically, with the old threats to Russia's national security changing and the new ones arising, the counteraction to these threats over the first decades of the 21st century has become a vital task of the Russian state. The author argues that Russia's scientific and technological development is a form of reaction to the challenges and threats to its national security, which, particularly, requires further legal regulation of the state's activities in the area of Russia's national security.

AB Introduction. In the Napoleonic era, political power set itself two tasks: to continue the traditions of the revolution in the formation of a new system of people and to make these changes correlate with the requirements of the new political system associated with the formation of the Empire. Historians have not paid enough attention to Napoleon's educational policy and the relation of these events to his political goals. Analysis. The Great French Bourgeois Revolution completely destroyed the old educational system. All universities and academies were closed. Secondary and primary schools sought to eliminate the influence of the Church. The revolutionary government proclaimed an equal right for all citizens to receive education, and the goal of education was to form a new personality in the spirit of the Republican morality. The main problems were the lack of a unified structure and the lack of teaching staff. Only during the reign of Napoleon a coherent and effective system of education was created, which included the interrelated stages of primary, secondary and higher education, the top of which was the University. All educational institutions in France were subject to it. The goal of the University was not only to train teachers, but also to establish a new imperial ideology based on the idea of national unity. Though the creation of the educational system was certainly successful for Napoleon, his main function, according to the Emperor, was ideological education, and he could not implement it. Results. The Imperial University remained ideologically independent from the political system of the Empire, since a significant part of the teaching staff held liberal views and was in hidden opposition to the Napoleonic regime. However, the structure of education created in this era lasted until the end of the 19th century, which indicates its success in terms of organizational principles and practical implementation.

   historical Russian studies; history of Russia in Germany; 1975-2014
AB This review deals with the chapter about modern Russian Studies in Germany in the collective monograph "Izuchenie Rossii sovremennymi istorikami Zapada i Vostoka", recently published under the editorship of N. V. Trubnikova. Its authors, the Tomsk historians V. V. Ageeva and M. A. Shtanko, have set a promising goal for their research: to approach the German rossievedenie in their overview covering the period from 1975 until 2014 with theoretical-methodological criteria instead of the more common in such cases political ones. In order to realize this project, they proposed to divide modern German historiography into three periods, with the latter one which covers the years 2005-2014 being a no less important innovation. However, it fell short of the reader's expectations. Unfortunately, the chapter "Sovremennoe nemetskoe rossievedenie: spetsifika diskursa, tematicheskie polia i protsess institucionalizacii" is a mere compilation of superficially adapted facts, conclusions and ideas mostly taken from other works. V. V. Ageeva and M. A. Shtanko do not seem to have paid attention to the fact that some of the data they draw on have already lost its actuality. Statistical material serves largely to confirm their own postulates, and most references to German historians and their studies are inaccurate and misspelled, which does not enhance comprehension. Overall, the reader gets the impression that the authors were due to finish their work under some time pressure. This probably would explain why they chose "to take the easy way out" - in the end, the welcoming innovative theses expressed at the beginning of the chapter are abandoned, whereas outdated cliches - confirmed.

AB The relevance of the my research is determined by the problems experienced by the European educational systems in connection with the increasing migration activity waves. Political and economic world crises, wars, and demographic instability entailed a threat to identity preservation by the national education systems. The objective of the paper is to examine the problem of the adaptation of migrants and refugees using the example of the German dual education system and efforts to resolve it by the federal government, the Federal Institute of Vocational Education, chambers of commerce, and industry and professional schools. The leading research methods were the scientific text analysis, expert interviews, and content analysis of empirical materials. As a result of the study, difficulties arising when migrants or refugees are involved in vocational education in the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) were identified; necessary conditions for effectiveness and sustainability of the dual education system as the national identity product were determined. The study materials can be useful for the researchers of the vocational education system of those countries with a high migration activity to determine mechanisms for responding to globalization changes, as well as vocational education systems of the countries seeking to borrow the German dual education experience in order to create conditions for the effective functioning of a similar educational model.

AB The review is based on the analysis of the book "Stalin and the Fate of Finland" written by Finnish historian Kimmo Rentola. "Ves' Mir" published the book in 2020. The book consists of four sections, each of which is dedicated to a specific story, and covers the period from 1939 to 1951. It is based on a diverse array of sources extracted mainly from Russian archives. A special place in the monograph is reserved for "Winter war" of 1939-1940 - an event, as shown in the review, still ambiguously evaluated by Finnish and Russian historians. Following the book's author, the reviewer evaluates the situation in European international affairs after the beginning of the World War II. She expresses her opinions about the reasons for Great Britain and France refusal to intervene directly in the conflict between the USSR and Finland, as well as the motives of Sweden, which was in favor of Finland, but did not risk to overstep its neutrality. In the second Chapter, the author of the book dwells in detail on the terms of the armistice between Finland and the USSR, the role of key figures - Stalin, Mannerheim, Paasikivi in the negotiations. The third Chapter of the book tells about the events of 1948, which was a test of strength for the Finnish foreign policy developed in the first post-war years. The last Chapter is devoted to the impact of the 1950-1951growing tension in the world on Stalin's attitude to domestic political events. The reviewer regrets that due to the essay nature of the book, its author did not dwell on some important episodes in the history of the Soviet-Finnish relations. Finally, the reviewer notes the skill of the Finnish historian in depicting historical characters and the author's captivating style.

AB Social media analysis is widely used in economics, sociology, in medical studies of spreading infectious diseases and in forensic science to stop terrorist networks and drug proliferation. Social media analysis is also used in political sphere. Opinion leaders are increasingly participating in social media. The Internet is a reflection of the real world, it has the same laws as in real society. The ruling elite controls the media and social media as well as it controls the means of production. The article addresses the role of social networks in the foreign and military policies of states and other actors. The spread of leadership networks is at its early state. The potential of this Internet resource format is enormous. There is every reason to assume that economic crisis makes such resources even more popular. During economic crisis many people are left alone with their problems by their government and they are even more motivated to social cooperation and mutual assistance in social networks to receive valuable information, attention and support from the outside.

AB The publication deals with the activity of the People's Progressive Party (PPP) of Malaysia - a political party of a social democratic style. Founded in 1953 at the initiative of the brothers-lawyers Sinivasagam, it was formed on the basis of personal devotion to leaders. It enjoyed influence mainly among the petty-bourgeois strata of the non-Malay communities of the state of Perak. In 1958-1975 it controlled the municipal council of Ipoh, in 1969-1972 - the government of the state of Perak. These were the years of its greatest influence. In its ranks, there were up to 300 thousand members. The party's entry into the ruling bloc "National Front" in 1974 led to a decline in its authority. Her mission is currently intercepted by the Democratic Action Party (DAP), which, as part of the Alliance "Harapan", came to power in the country after successful performance in the 2018 general elections. The success of the DAP put an end to the existence of the PPP.

AB This article analyzes the causes of dissolution of the Soviet Union in the publications of American political scientists. More than twenty-five years have passed since dissolution of the USSR, the most important event in world history in the end of the 20th century. Despite the past years, among historians, political scientists and current politicians, disputes about causes that have led to this epoch-making event do not cease. For some, dissolution of the Soviet Union seems to be a triumph of Western democratic values and a market economy, while for others it is 'the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century'. Particular attention is paid to the analysis of the causes of dissolution of the USSR in American political science. After analyzing the various approaches to the problem of dissolution of the USSR, which have become firmly established in American political science, the authors come to the conclusion that, despite the years that have passed since this event, there was no consensus in the US scientific community with regard to causes of the tectonic shift in the global policy represented by the dissolution of the second superpower.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE social phenomenology; theory of justice; ethics prioritizes over
   ontology; moral consciousness; ethical formalism; universalism
AB The issue of justice occupies one of the central places in the history of philosophy. On the one hand, this is determined by the significant social importance of justice, and at the same time it is problematic to reach social and scientific consensus regarding the very conception of justice and its attainability. Perhaps, this is the reason, why this problem has become an unsolvable one, a sort of eternal philosophical question. Despite this, scholars demonstrate little interest in it and it is located on the periphery of the research field. However, the issue of justice has not lost its topicality in political and social philosophy, and it is perfectly proved by a vivid discussion initiated by J. Rawls, in which the concept of justice has been infused with a considerable value. The present discussion about the foundations and principles of justice became the reason to once again turn to the phenomenological concept of justice of Emmanuel Levinas. He believed that ethics had a priority over ontology, and such a fundamental approach allows one to analyze his ethical ideas as one of the perspective areas for inquiry into the phenomenon of justice. Our paper considers the main tenets of Levinas's social phenomenology, among which ethics takes priority over ontology. It analyses the relations with the Other that appear on the basis of compassion and love, which Levinas perceived as understanding and acceptance in the context of the ideas of rationalism and universalism. The paper argues that ethical formalism is inherent to rationalist philosophy, whereas in social phenomenology another understanding of justice is suggested, which defines with the transcendency of the Other. The latter is demonstrated as an ontological advantage and the possibility of recognition of each human being as a unique person, worthy of respect.

   proficiency in foreign languages; educational complex
AB In modern conditions of rapid development of international contacts and ties in culture, politics, economics and other spheres, practical knowledge of foreign languages becomes a real necessity and an indispensable condition for a successful career. Educators and researchers in recent decades have increasingly focused on the unity of motivational-cognitive and behavioral components in the graduate's personality structure. The broader concepts reflecting this unit turned out to be "competence" and "being competent." Contextual analysis of the concepts "competence" and "professional competence" indicates that various approaches to their interpretation have now been developed. The competence-action approach could implement the conceptual idea of modernizing the teaching and learning process, that is, ensuring mastery of communicative activities through the development of a set of competences focused on opportunities, skills, needs, cognitive activity and creativity of the students with clear political implications. It is concluded that, the competence in foreign languages is based on the development of constitutive capacities, such as: linguistic, communicative, transcultural, sociocultural, intellectual, educational, professional and critical thinking.

AB With the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic in Russia there have been significant changes in all spheres of life. For the first time in the country's history, schoolchildren and students have completely switched to distance, or online, education. Despite the fact that many educational institutions had the technical possibility to conduct online classes, many of them really used it only during the pandemic for the first time. This caused serious problems in the transition to online education, with both technical and personal challenges. This article discusses distance education, its advantages and disadvantages, the difference from traditional university education using the example of undergraduate and graduate students studying English in the "translator in the field of professional communication" (international relations, political science, sociology, state and civil service, etc.) program. The author's goal was to identify the degree of efficiency of online education and to provide a conclusion on the prospects of replacing traditional education. Using various methodological tools, the author's English practical classes with students were considered. To begin with, a detailed description of traditional, offline classes was given, followed by an elicitation of the advantages and disadvantages of this format of education. The author then explored online learning with the same groups of students with the same options. Finally, as a result of the comparison, the effectiveness of the two methods of foreign language learning is analyzed and the prospects for the full implementation of distance education in the future are concluded.

SO SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Serbia; EU; Russia; China; NATO; the policy of multivectorness; the
   Kosovo problem
AB The Balkans remain a zone of strategic vulnerability. The aggravation of the latter has been defined by the struggle of the leading actors of world politics for the southern European country which has been for the time being relatively neutral in political and military senses, i.e. Serbia. Despite serious upheavals of the turn of the twenty-first century (the destruction of Yugoslavia, NATO bombings, the "divorce" with Montenegro and the creation of the "Republic of Kosovo") Belgrade has been managing to balance between two major poles of attraction - EU-NATO and Russia, which fits into the concept of multivectorness. Given all geographic, historical, cultural and economic predetermination of European integration its final choice by Serbia is burdened by two essentially important moments - the need to recognize the "Republic of Kosovo" and the inclusion in the military and political framework of the NATO. Moreover, the first issue brings substantial political and civilizational risks both for the Western Balkans and the whole of the European Union, let alone a serious internal split of the Serbian society in relation to the possibility of recognizing the Albanian new formation. A natural counterweight to the Euro-Atlanticist pressure on Belgrade is Russia which has unique image possibilities and unlike the EU does not pretend to play the role of an "empire by invitation". The situation becomes more complicated by the fact that the existing historical dualism of multivectorness is being disrupted by the emergence in the Balkans of a new player - China. By solely economic levers Beijing has been solving strategic problems of penetration to European markets and simultaneously smoothly, but sequentially has been superseding Russia as Serbia's main alternative of the West. Analyzing the tactics of the economic measures of Chinese companies the article concludes that there has been growing a concealed competition between the People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation for the place of the main non-European actor not only in Serbia, but in the Balkans as a whole. In such circumstances the preservation of the policy of multivectorness (despite all criticism of the concept) can serve Serbia as the way out of the impasse of strategic vulnerability, i.e. to preserve in the short-term the prospect of the status quo of political, military and strategic neutrality.

AB China's foreign policy in recent years is characterized by a number of distinctive features. First, the preparation for the anniversary and the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the country allowed Beijing to clarify the periodization of the People's Republic of China foreign policy's history and to bring it in line with the general periodization of the history of the state. Secondly, the coinciding forty years of establishing diplomatic relations with the United States and the exacerbation of the so-called Sino-American trade war have predetermined the preservation of Washington's leading position in the circle of Beijing's foreign policy priorities. Third, China's growing interest in deepening and intensifying ties with Russia has given grounds to declare the transition of bilateral Russian-Chinese relations to a new stage. The COVID 19 coronavirus epidemic has had a significant impact on many areas of Chinese society and state life, including foreign policy. However, its important features of recent years, such as the growing confrontation with the United States and the promotion of the concept of "community of the common destiny of mankind", have not changed.

They proposed various combinations and configurations of models of the transformation of statehood, the concept of revived natural law, constitutionalism, law and freedom, etc., which were the theoretical basis of Russian liberal jurisprudence. The representatives of liberalism were based on the ideas of neo-Kantianism, neolibianism, neo-negaglianism and other currents of Western philosophy, looking for political and legal concepts that could predict and substantiate the future development of the Russian state and law. One of the representatives of the new liberal philosophy was B.A. Kistyakovsky, the importance of his research for modern legal science, practice and the formation of Russian liberal jurisprudence is presented.

AB In the historical context, the digital economy coincides with the processes of the re-industrialization of the national economy in many countries, among which Russia is far from last. In these processes, intellectual capital acquires significant importance, which receives a powerful tool for its amplification in digital technologies. The capitalization of a person's mental abilities is accompanied by business growth, which could not be ensured by the behavioral factors of human capital, characteristic of the industrial era of economic development. Restructuring of production factors associated with a decrease in the value of behavioral factors and an increase in the role of mental-cognitive functions in production processes occurs. The purpose of our research is to study the restructuring processes and highlight the main factors of production as business resources, transformed into means of innovative development under the influence of digital technologies. Provisions of the philosophy of science, economic theory, political economy were used for research purposes. The concept of the cognitive factor of production (CFP), as the main means of innovative development in the digital economy, can be considered the main result.

AB Corruption in state agencies constitutes a major social threat, since it both directly and indirectly affects social values, morality and national foundations. The level of corruption in a society or a country is the key factor for making a judgment of its civil society development, as well as for estimating its political, economic and social risks. Today, in the age of globalization, corruption is of particularly great concern. This phenomenon is perceived by the authorities of many countries as a deep problem for national security. Moreover, corruption is considered both internal and external threat. Many countries being aware of danger posed by corruption execute consistent works to reduce its rate through introducing and exercising appropriate legislation, which always has prominent national characteristics. On the basis of the legislation adopted in Russia, an integrate and sound system of organizing the activities of civil servants was built, which is able to reduce the corruption rate in the country. However, all measures implemented have not taken any sufficient effect yet. When it is not being constantly tackled, corruption tends to expand and develop, so anti-corruption activities are among the basic functions of any state.

ID CRISIS
AB An immense role in the collapse of the USSR was played by a whole array of factors: the public being tired of the Communist project; the massive shortages of consumer goods, which made people hate the government; the growing opposition within the Communist party to Gorbachev's reforms; the hesitation of the General Secretary who tried to rely in turn either on the right or on the left wing; the drastic fall in the living standards. The crucial role, however, was played by "the parade of sovereignties" and the Centre being too late in its attempts to address the national question. By the autumn of 1990, the President's close associates started to sense that power was slipping from Gorbachev's hands; with the fellow countrymen staying remarkably indifferent, the Soviet Union was heading towards dissolution as the ambitions of local party leaders in the constituent republics generated and cannily magnified nationalist and separatist trends. Gorbachev kept up his maneuver strategy, which put him on the verge of resignation in the spring of 1991 when his support was minimal. He seemed, though, to have managed to pull out of this dive thanks to the Soviet Union referendum held on March 17, in which the voters were asked if they considered the preservation of the USSR necessary. Eventually, however, the issue of preserving or not preserving a unified state depended directly on the position of Russia as the backbone of the Soviet Union. The study draws on the author's personal archive of original testimonies and interviews of the political figures directly involved in the events in question.

AB The article aims to show the similarities in views in the historiosophical and socio-political sphere between such Russian thinkers as K.N. Leontiev and A.F. Losev. This subject is quite unexpected, because Losev is usually perceived as a follower of V.S. Solovyov, whose views and methodology were in many ways opposed to the ideas of such "a lone thinker" as K.N. Leontiev. However, if we take the subject of the analysis of Losev's works of "pre-camp period", we can see distinct similarities between Losev and Leontiev in the views of feudalism and capitalism, the middle Ages and Modern times, the role of the Church and science, etc. They were also united by the approach to culture as a single whole type, when the economy and social life are typologically and stylistically seen as the same in aesthetics, art, morals and household mores, etc. Therefore, Losev in the socio-political sphere and historiosophy can be considered as a kind of follower and even like-minded to K.N. Leontiev. The author separately touches the theme of similarities and differences between the views of Leontiev and Losev on socialism and communism. He concludes that the generality of their views on these subjects in this period, as well as the fact that Losev can also be counted among the supporters of Byzantium, is largely due to the type of their Christian-Church consciousness. It is not a mere coincidence that they are the only prominent Russian religious thinkers who took the monastic vows.

The country's banking system is not adequate to the needs of the national economy and is unable to provide resources for the country's modernization. The ability of banks to finance the needs of the real sector is significantly constrained by the lack of long-term and cheap financial resources from the banks themselves.

AB The study of mass consciousness is one of the most pressing sociological issues. Historical memory is a part of mass consciousness, and it is obvious that the historical memory about any event has its specifics in different societies. Today memories about the World War II became an object of manipulation for various political forces that aim at changing public opinion in favor of particular parties, and the youth is especially affected by such influence. The student youth is a reactive social force and can subsequently transfer such influence into actions. Therefore, the study of the international students' types of historical memory provides a unique opportunity to reveal the global perception of the World War II. The article presents a typology of historical memory based on the classical structure of social attitude as consisting of affective (views on the justice of the war results), cognitive (knowledge of the war milestones) and behavioral components (knowledge and participation in commemorative events, and family stories). There are nine types of historical memory: personal-historical, dispositional, formal-historical, emotional-historical, fragmentary-historical, mythological-historical, subjective-historical, value-historical, 'lack-of-memory'. The majority of students have an emotional-historical, formal-historical types and 'lack-of-memory'. Without 'lacking-memory' students, the share of which is smaller among Russian students, foreign students have mainly an emotional-historical and formal-historical types of memory, while Russian students rather formal-historical and value-historical types. The article explains the way for identifying types of memory. Thus, it can be useful for methodologists and researchers in sociology of history.

AB The article analyzes existing models in counteraction to crime as one of the threats to national security. On the basis of the analysis of the legislation, a conclusion was made about the priority of the preventive approach in this sphere. At the same time, modern criminal policy demonstrates a qualitatively different method, oriented more towards the increasing repressiveness of the criminal law. One of the possible reasons for such a situation is the lack of criminological substantiation of legislative, political, economic, etc. transformations adopted today, which actualizes the criminological scientific research on the declared problems. In this regard, interdisciplinary and comparative criminological research, focusing primarily on preventive responses, is of the greatest importance in combating crime. This includes situational crime prevention, based on the achievements of rational choice theory integrated within the framework of environmental criminology, and crime prevention strategies based on environmental design (CPTED).

AB The paper deals with the issues of ideology and practice of the land patriotic movement in Tyrol during the French-Bavarian occupation in the Napoleonic period. The movement under Andreas Hofer, which became a basis for the uprising in the region, had a goal to abolish the foreign leadership, which was recognized as the oppression of the religious and political freedom alongside with placing the "unjust" border in the region. The Tyrolean movement functioned in a framework with the reformist government of the count Philipp von Stadion and the advocates of reforms in the Habsburg family - archdukes Karl and Johann. During the Napoleonic dominance in Germany, the movement also tapped into the framework of the national movement in Germany, even despite the fact, that they differed from each other in the methods of impacting the public opinion.

AB The article is devoted to the 1941-1945 debates between the anti-Hitler coalition countries - the USSR on the one hand and Great Britain and the USA on the other - on post-war settlement in Central and South-Eastern Europe in case of Allied powers' victory in World War II. Based on diplomatic documents, correspondence of J. Stalin, W. Churchill and F. Roosevelt, memoirs and diaries of political figures and diplomats of that period, the author recreates and analyzes not only the debates between the USSR, Great Britain and the United States. He also analyzes the evolution of Stalin's position towards Churchill's plans for the partition of Germany and the creation of federations (confederations) in the CEEC. The post-World War II border changes in Central and South-Eastern Europe were discussed by Moscow, London and Washington in the context of ideas about their areas of interest, post-war security principles and safeguards to prevent the threat of a new world war. The discussions began in August 1941 by the Atlantic Charter and ended in 1945 in Yalta and Potsdam. First, the author examines the plans of German Fuhrer and Nazi Minister of Foreign Affairs for a new order in Central and South-Eastern Europe and the system of interstate and interethnic relations established under the leadership of Nazi Germany. Then, he analyzes the Soviet, British and American proposals, which the Allied Powers opposed to the Nazi plans, taking into account the presence of two camps in the Resistance movement in both occupied and enemy countries.

AB By decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of October 5, 1945, the first post-war elections to this supreme body of state power were scheduled for February 10, 1946. The political leadership attached exceptional importance to the election campaign launched in autumn 1945. The election campaign and its results could have been an indicator of the mood of Soviet society, permitting to estimate whether the victory in the war had been able to neutralize the accumulated fatigue from the hardships of the war and to prevent the growth of negative feelings among the population towards the communist party and Soviet leadership. Thus, the authorities paid special attention to the organization of the elections to the Supreme Soviet in Leningrad, the city which survived the siege. Political and ideological support for the election campaign of autumn 1945 - winter 1946 was not the only task that the Soviet and party structures in Leningrad were concerned about. Purely organizational and technical aspects of the elections required coordination between a large number of departments and organizations. One of the most serious organizational problems was the lack of trained personnel to work in election commissions. The Central State Archive of St. Petersburg has some limited number of documents that allow us to study the organizational and technical side of the elections in Leningrad in 1945-46.

AB Under the conditions of crisis and catastrophic events of the 20th century, a significant deepening of historiosophical thought took place, and attempts to create explanatory models of the historical development of society intensified. In the third millennium of the Christian era, new problems have already accumulated, requiring a new awareness of the culture-forming role of Christianity in modern conditions. Questions of understanding the historical process have been raised for many centuries, but at the present stage they are posed anew. A new perspective has appeared in the topic of comprehending history - the theology of history. In the tradition of Russian religious philosophy, it is associated with the names of N. Berdyaev and - especially - G. Florovsky. To this issue has been paid attention; new publications have been included. In addition, other approaches to understanding the historical process are considered in the work. The authors focus on the Christian tradition as a system of sociohistorical relay races and broadcasts and the proposed systematic understanding of a person in his being in history and culture as part of this tradition. It is also shown that tradition as a historical phenomenon often becomes an object of ideological and political speculation and needs protection.

AB The article mainly concentrates on the formation of a border military-political structure in the south and southeast of the Russian Empire in the second third of the 18th century. The fundamental principles of the relations between the state and the ethno-confessional groups of the steppe borderlands and their local elites at the head of them in a certain period of the early Modern Time were first studied in the scholar history literature. A representative example of the study is the Stavropol Kalmyk host (since 1745 - the corps of christened Kalmyks). The formation of the host upper estate around the first ruler of the Kalmyk settlement in Stavropol-on-Volga, convert princess Anne Taishin/Daichin (Tseren Yandji, granddaughter of Ochirt Tsetsen Khan) was traced on the base of little-known documents. The character/nature of social relations in which the ruling and most influential host commanders was included is indicated in proposed research, and the manifestations of social differentiation in this layer are revealed here also. Most attention is paid to the actual status and social claims of the privileged stratum of the host in comparison with its legal status. It is demonstrated that during the reign of Elizaveta Petrovna this group sought corporate feudal privileges by an explicit procedure due to the connivance, expressed both in laws of the state and in the policy of the local civil-military administration. However, it is indicated that with the advent of Catherine II, the situation began to change in the opposite direction. The author states in conclusion that with the development of political interaction of Russia with the Steppe and in the conditions of Catherine's toleration, the local group of the baptized Kalmyk aristocracy ceased to be in demand by the state, and, accordingly, the growth of its social privileges was limited.

The regulatory role of social policy of the Russian Empire in the early Modern Time influenced the inner state of the ethno-confessional groups is investigated for the first time in historiography. The proposed research bases on the materials of the history of the one of largest military service estates of mentioned years the Volga Stavropol' Kalmyks which remain generally are unknown to current day. The article based on rich sources describes the process of forming the Stavropol' Kalmyk host as result of convertation of the of a part of the Kalmyk elite led by noyon Baksadai-Dordji - Prince Peter Taishin to Orthodoxy, the christening and inclusion in the host of a number of prominent representatives of the then Kalmyk aristocracy and their entourage also traces in the article. Most attention is paid to the characteristics of social relations among baptized Kalmyks, and the preservation of traditional norms and obligations of the upper and lower levels of society is demonstrated. The research reveals the support of the existing social relations by the Russian authorities, which are focused on protecting the social privileges of the nobility, regardless of their religion. The author states in conclusion that the change of the confession did not affect the social status of new-christened aristocrats their previous horizontal connections. As result baptized and unbaptized parts of the Kalmyk nobility coexisted on equal terms, without antagonism within the complex service relationship that supported the religious policy and was the basis of Imperial political and military system.

AB The article mainly concentrates on the state religious policy of the middle of the 18th century the least studied period in the process of formation of Russian religious tolerance in the early Modern Time. The process of interaction between the Russian authorities and the old believers-re-emigrants in the New Russia investigated for the first time in historiography. The author characterizes the process of inclusion of settlers in the southern program of re-emigration of Old Believers and their integration into the system of Russian orders on the basis of little-known unpublished materials. Political and administrative factors that stimulated or, on the contrary, hindered the mass return of the fugitive population to their homeland also marked in this article. Most attention is paid to the Collegium of Foreign Affairs, which contributed to the establishment of mutual understanding between the local provincial authorities and the contingent of immigrants in the Russian Empire and neighboring and nearest countries in the last year of the reign of Empress Elizaveta Petrovna and a short time on the throne of Emperor Peter III. The author states in conclusion that the principles of religious liberalization, which then gave an impulse to religious tolerance and formed the basis of the religious policy of classical "enlightened absolutism" in Russia, were mainly formed in the studied time.

AB For the first time in Russian historiography the author analyzes the relations between Catherine II and Catholics at the start of her political biography as she was a Grand Duchess. The future empress's contacts with Catholic circles are studied on the basis of unpublished documents of Russian and foreign origin collected by the Collegium of Foreign Affairs.
   Special attention is paid to the Catholic missionaries' efforts to gain support from Grand Duchess Catherine for expanding missionary work in Southern Russia and neighbouring Caucasus. Catherine's Catholic ties are seen in the political and diplomatic context, with Austrian diplomacy and the papacy involved. The author shows how the missionaries' activities, largely due to the union between Russia and the Austrian monarchy, caused local religious conflicts, e.g. between the Catholics and Grigorian Armenians. It took the Russian central and local authorities a lot of efforts to settle them. The involvement of crowned members in religious policy was possible due to the presence of European Catholic environment in the capital and at the Court as well as in the Russian province, particularly, in the south of the country.
   The author concludes that Catherine's ties with the Catholics had a permanent character. The closer ties between Catherine and the Catholics signaled her political independence and her search for foreign support before she took decisive steps in her struggle for power.

   system; Volga Region; Siberia; Russian Far East
AB Pension legislation and the payment of pensions to military and civil employees by anti-Bolshevik governments were not studied before in Russia's historical research, except for a few publications. Finding new sources has enabled the author to expand the knowledge about legal initiatives and practices of paying pensions by anti-Bolshevik governments in the east of Russia. Moreover, their pension policies are seen in a wider context of the pension policies performed by anti-Bolshevik governments in the South, North and North-West of Russia.
   The most detailed legal regulation of the pension system was done by the Provisional Siberian government and Admiral Kolchak's Russian government, which helped to resume paying contributions to the pension fund and at the same time fix rather small, but guaranteed pensions from the treasury. The main problem was how to adapt pensions to the rapidly falling rouble. Another problem was taking into account of the political and ideological situation of the Russian Civil War, which excluded social payments to political opponents and required to provide benefits for the defenders of the current government.
   Despite some considerable differences, the pension polices of anti-Bolshevik governments in the East of Russia are similar in their rejection from class principles, the recognition of the government's social commitments of the same scope as before the revolution, and the tendency to adapt these obligations to the conditions of the Russian Civil War. The comparative analysis shows that in other anti-Bolsevik-controlled regions the authorities faced and addressed almost the same challenges.

AB The authors of the article indicate a circle of methodological problems that have emerged in historiography, devoted to assessing the Russian national policy effectiveness in the 19th and early 21st centuries. The main trends in the subject area of research, determined by the inclusion of modern ethnic processes in the context of the genesis of state institutions, political, socio-economic and cultural processes and ideological constructs.
   The article notes the interdependence of the problems: a limited circle of methods used by researchers, integration studies at the intersection of social and natural sciences, as well as specialists involved as experts by executive authorities of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation responsible for the implementation of national policy. This tendency is manifested in a limited number of research teams, focused on the current ethnosocial situation monitoring and Russian peoples' ethnic history studying.
   At the same time, it was noted that scientific paradigm change and conducting integration studies makes it possible to adjust the concept of the native's Russian peoples' ethnic history through the determination of the mechanism of continuity and interdependence of the Russian government regional national policy in the imperial, Soviet and post-Soviet periods. It's proposed to identify the interdependence of political courses through the identification of processes: a) the environmental management, native's traditional social organization and subsistence systems transformation; b) ethnic minorities adapt to the country's political history through ethnic and social stratification, economy ethnic sectors formation.
   The article suggests schematizing the qualification levels of ongoing ethnosocial studies.
   At the initial stage (master's program, postgraduate) it's proposed to focus on the accumulated experience of national regions researching procedures for identifying, processing, scientific criticism, based on the principles of a systematic approach to the predecessor works. At the next stage (doctoral studies) it is proposed to focus on the modern techniques of applied anthropology development. To focus on methods for identifying and analyzing latent social processes that determine: a) the socio-cultural genesis of the studied ethnic groups; b) a system of intra- and interethnic communications; c) the dynamics of changes in the ethnosocial situation in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation.
   The proposed strategy of abandoning the axiological approach to assessing the effectiveness of national policies objectively initiates a dynamic and qualitative change of the research subject field; the formation of the possibility of integration studies at the intersection of history, classical ethnography, ethnology, sociology, political science and cultural science. Changing the training system for ethnologists and historians of national politics in the Russian Academy of Sciences and higher education systems will allow us to adapt our research to the sustainable development of national regions of Russian Federation.

DE ethnicity; ethnic language identity; ethnodemography; Mari; native

AB The issues of ethnodemographic and ethnolinguistic development of the Mari population in Bashkortostan are considered. Particular attention is paid to the characteristics of the ethnodemographic situation in the regions of the country with a significant number of the Mari ethnic group. The results of a comparative analysis of the natural reproduction of the Mari in comparison with other ethnic groups in the republic are presented. The question is raised about the ethnolinguistic identity of the Mari population, which, according to census data, is losing its national language. The novelty of the study is seen in the fact that for the first time an analysis of the demographic and linguistic aspects of the development of the Mari population in the regions of the Ural-Volga region was carried out. The relevance of the study is due to the fact that the issue of demographic development of the peoples of Russia at the present stage is becoming not only a social, but also a political and strategic problem. The authors elaborate on the results of interethnic interaction of the Maris in the zone of ethnocultural contacts. It is proved that, despite the high birth rate, the demographic development of the Maris has a negative balance. A review of the ethno-linguistic development of the Mari population is carried out taking into account the administrative-territorial division. It is concluded that the emerging trend of urbanization of the Mari negatively affects the preservation of the native Mari language.

AB Although the dramatic change in the global situation caused by the coronavirus pandemic has temporarily overshadowed some international problems, the need to resolve the latter has not been eliminated. One of these "smoldering" problems remains the situation in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (BRV), which directly affects interests of some world's largest actors. The internationalization of the Venezuelan conflict is fraught with risks that sooner or later can affect many aspects of international political and economic life. Because of this, the need to monitor the crisis in Venezuela is not only eliminated, but sooner or later will require new attention.
   The article argues for the inevitability of internationalization of the conflict in the BRV due to a number of circumstances and describes official and practical positions of Russia, China and the United States on the situation in Venezuela. Especially is noted the high probability of Beijing's search for a middle-compromise line between N. Maduro and supporters of H. Guaido, aimed at the maximum possible preservation of Chinese political and economic assets in Venezuela in any event.
   The article emphasizes, that the US position on the Venezuelan issue is motivated by Washington's desire to "blur" international and domestic positions of not only Caracas, but also Havana, and to limit the political and economic maneuver in Latin America of Russia and China. The author also notes that the current situation on the world oil markets complicates the state of affairs in Venezuela, creating new risks for the country itself as well as for its international partners.
   The paper provides a forecast of the situation in Venezuela. The author comes to the conclusion that at this point further protraction of the crisis of power in this country is the most likely course of events. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to stagnation in the global economy, which has shifted the attention of the parties from the conflict to other tasks and dimed their strategic activity. However, despite the fact that probable changing in the BRV situation does not yet meet current political and economic aspirations of the parties to the conflict and the international actors involved, the time will inevitably come when the Venezuelan crisis requires its resolution.

AB The article analyses and describes the results of studying how the students perceive the image of a modem university teacher. Tertiary education in the 21st century requires changes in teacher attitudes and behaviours. The perception of the teacher's image by students is one of the most important factors affecting their attitude to the academic process. Several criteria assessed by the students anonymously are singled out: professional, personality-related and social ones. It seems reasonable to look for the peculiarities of teacher image perception by the students of different universities, namely the College of Asian and African Studies (CAAS of MSU) and the Russian Economic University (REU). The aim of the study was to identify and analyse the specific features of the image of teacher perceived by various groups of students. The empirical part of the study was conducted at the chair of West European languages of CAAS. The participants were: 45 students of CAAS, majoring in one of the four specialties: philology, history, economics or political science, and 31 students of the REU, studying economics or IT. The students of CAAS learn oriental or African languages and European languages, while REU students learn only English. The methodology of the study was to design a questionnaire in order to reveal the teacher personality traits, social and professional qualities. The analysis showed that the students' perceptions of the teacher image undergo some transformation over years of study, though not very dramatic. The professional component proves to be the most crucial for undergraduate students of both universities. Most students agree that the content knowledge is more important than general erudition or command of contemporary teaching methods. The most important personality traits tumed out to be communication skills - the ability to listen and hear and respect for students. As for the teacher type, there is a distinct mismatch between expectations and reality.

DE migratory processes; migratory phobia; educational migration; conflict
   of migratory processes; COVID-19
AB The objective of the research was to discuss the conflictive nature of the migratory processes that occur in the world today. The need to adapt and solve daily problems inevitably requires the State to implement international, state and regional standards for the implementation of the rights and opportunities of migrants both in the territory of the donor country and in the territory of the recipient country. On the other hand, we see an increase in the phobia of migrants and the characteristic racism of countries where labor migration flows are increasing. In methodological terms, use was made of hermeneutics close to political ethnography. It is concluded that, for a long time, the criticism of racism has developed as a criticism of colonialism, Nazism, including anti-Semitism, and in modern times as a political criticism of migration-phobia and nationalism, in which the Racist speech and practices have found and do find obvious and complete expression. Migrant phobia is a concept that latently generates motives of political, ideological, racial, national, religious hatred, xenophobia, or hostility towards an ethnic or social group within the framework of social practices.

AB The authors have presented the research of the conceptual foundations and key priorities of the Arctic policy of circumpolar states in the paper. The relevance of the research is determined by the geopolitical and economic significance of the Arctic. At the same time, there is no any unified international legal center that establishes legal and normative standards of activities in the Arctic. Circumpolar states together and individually develop legal framework of a country, taking into account the following: firstly, their priorities; secondly, the existing legal status of land, water and air spaces of the Arctic; thirdly, global interests of the present and future of the planet. In the presented paper, the authors have revealed some key priorities of the state Arctic policies of circumpolar countries on the base of the analysis of political and programmatic documents. The analysis of political and programmatic documents has shown that the state Arctic policies of the circumpolar countries are focused on expanding of external interaction in the Arctic and maintaining the sustainable development of their own Arctic territories. Certain of main disadvantages of the circumpolar countries' Arctic strategies have been determined. According to the analysis of the conceptual framework and key priorities of the Arctic policies of the circumpolar countries, the conclusion concerning declarative nature of national Arctic strategies has been drawn. It has been shown that main institutions for the practical realization of Arctic policies are regional strategies for socio-economic development. National priorities and regional opportunities is the basis for the development of regional strategies.

AB Nowadays the fuel and energy complex of the Republic of Korea has been suffering a tumultuous time: the dependence on power resources is extremely high. Despite of the fact that South Korea has been trying to diversify the supply of such resources, the majority of them is imported from Middle Eastern countries, where the political situation is unstable. Moreover, the energy policy of the South Korean government, which in particular is directed at reducing the consumption of nuclear and coal energy resources and further closure of all nuclear power plants, has been facing difficulties. In such a situation, it is necessary for the Republic of Korea to develop its energy cooperation with reliable partners such as Russia, not only in the existing areas, but also by cooperation in new prospective spheres. In our opinion, it is highly important to intensify bilateral partnership in electricity industry, where Russia has a valuable experience. The proposed initiatives by the Russian side, such as the "Asian Energy Super Ring" project, can significantly increase the energy security for the project participants. Nonetheless, we cannot boast much of the high level of our energy partnership. The article analyzes current South Korean policy in energy sphere, assesses the level of external actors' influence in the power market, researches opportunities and problems of Russia-ROK's energy cooperation.

AB Imported products found in the sites of the Central Asian region are an important source for studying various aspects of the nomad's history. The purpose of this article is the analyses of Chinese objects from Turkic funeral complexes of Central Asia for the study of distribution of such things in the second half of the 1st millennium AD. The source of the work are the materials of excavations of about 450 graves, most of which were investigated in the Altai-Sayan region and Mongolia. The chronology of the sites under consideration is determined within the framework of the VI-XI centuries AD. During the study of the Turkic graves 17 Chinese coins and 19 mirrors were found. In addition to this 50 graves included fragments of silk and two complexes - the remains of lacquer caps.
   The study was based on an integrated approach, involving the use of various methods of analysis of available materials. The cartography method was applied, which allowed to determine the peculiarities of the distribution of Chinese products in various parts of the Central Asian region. As part of the characteristics of objects, the method of morphological analysis was used, as well as the method of analogies, which made it possible to specify the dating of things The results of studying Chinese subjects with the help of natural science methods are taken into account.
   The study of findings made it possible to characterize the peculiarities of contacts of nomads with China at various stages of history. It is established that the earliest imports are in Turkic sites of the First Khaganate (second half of the 6th - first half of the 7th century AD). Until this time, the nomadic relations with China were fragmentary, which was explained by the subordinate position of the Turks in the political system of the Central Asian region, dependence on the Rouran and the lack of direct access to trade routes. One of the results of the creation of the empire and the active military expansion was the appearance of rare items of Chinese imports (silk products and one coin) in the Turkic burials. The main part of products from Chinese craft centers was found in the funeral complexes of Central Asian Turks dated by the second half of the 7 - the first half of the 8 century AD. It could be explained by the fact that after the founding of the Second East Turkic Kaganate the nomads again had the opportunity to receive imported things Probably, a significant part of the imported products came to the cattle-breeders of the Central Asian region as a result of favorable trade agreements with China, concluded on the basis of the successful war in 721-723 AD. The number of imports in the Turkic sites of the second half of the 8-9 centuries AD is much smaller. This was due to the collapse of the Kaganate and the entrance of nomads to the Uygur and Kyrgyz empires. Thus, the revealed trends in the distribution of Chinese imports in the archaeological complexes of the Central Asian Turks are fully correlated with the main political events in the region. The degree of access of nomads to the "prestigious" imported products was determined by the ability to control trade routes, as well as the overall activity of contacts with the southern neighbor. The logic of historical events corresponds to the trend of territorial distribution of findings. The main part of Chinese products found in the Altai, where the Turkic society developed over a long period of time and with the least influence of other groups of nomads. A small number of imports in the sites of Mongolia could be explained by the lack of targeted research of Turkic burials in this territory. Prospects for further studies of Chinese products from the archaeological sites are associated with the application of methods of natural sciences, as well as the subsequent comparison of the obtained results with the data of Chinese specialists.

TI FROM ANTI-OEDIPUS TO ANTI-HYPE: A CRITIQUE OF HYPERSTITION
SO LOGOS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE hyperstition; science fiction; hype; virus; accelerationism; future
AB The article describes the current state of left-wing post-Deleuzian philosophy, which is going through a period of obsession with the production of fictions. The authors argue that science fiction is today often mobilized as a tool for imagining a future that is incommensurable with the current late capitalist order. However, when trying to imagine a post-capitalist future, contemporary left-wing philosophers tend to look to the past for inspiration, a maneuver which only exacerbates the "exhaustion of the future," that has retrofuturism as its cultural correlate. Based on this, the authors suggest that philosophical instrumentalization of science fiction may result in a distinct form of intellectual escapism. The article argues that in this context, special attention should be paid to the concept of hyperstition, which has arisen under the influence of science fiction narratives and is embedded in current popular rhetoric about hacking the future. The authors point out that the way hyperstition functions has a resemblance to marketing mechanisms, and they suggest that it corresponds to what Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari called an unconscious representation or fake image.
   The article subjects hyperstition to a critical analysis in which the authors show that the genealogy of hyperstition as a practice of programming reality through fictions stems from the ideas of William S. Burroughs. Burroughs set out to develop new ways of linguistic infection and modeling human behavior by means of his cutup technique. This approach blurs the distinction between reality and fiction. Some members of the CCRU transplanted Burroughs' ideas to the theoretical soil that Deleuze and Guattari had tilled. Hyperstition has been reborn in the CCRU's legacy project of left-wing accelerationism, which redirects the idea of self-fulfilling fiction toward developing a non-deterministic concept of progress. Pointing to the ineffectiveness of hyperstition as a tool for socio-political change, the authors propose abandoning Anti-Oedipus in favor of Anti-Hype.

TI MYTH OF KING ARTHUR AS A CONCEPTUAL MATRIX FOR UNDERSTANDING BREXIT
SO NAUCHNYI DIALOG
LA Russian
DT Article
DE mythology; King Arthur; Brexit cognitive mechanisms; media discourse
AB The article analyses media discourse characterized by appealing to the myth about King Arthur against the background of the political crisis in the UK (Brexit). The publications of the British press in 2016-2019, online polls and blogs served as a material. Applying both linguistic and conceptual analysis, we identify the stages the myth about King Arthur gets gradually actualized. Cognitive mechanisms that get profiled at each stage are considered. Three stages of myth actualization are distinguished: (1) from using the idiom about the search for the Holy Grail in politics to comparing Brexit with finding a magic artifact, (2) comparing crisis participants with other elements of the myth, (3) modeling the way out of the crisis through the description of the search for a new leader. Particular attention is paid to how the individual elements of the myth work in dynamics. For example, it is shown that the image of the Grail undergoes an axiological reassessment from positive to negative as attitudes toward political events and figures change. We conclude that in times of crisis, society turns to national mythology, reinterprets it within a new context.

AB The article tells about the history of foundation and activities of the leading higher technical institution (university) in modern China - Harbin Polytechnic University, which is celebrating its centenary this year. Its establishment was due to the development of industry in the North-East of China and the construction of the Chinese Eastern railway, which needed highly qualified personnel. In 1920 at the initiative of a group of Russian engineers and professors of Imperial universities belonging to the "white emigration", the "Society for the establishment of a Russian-Chinese technical college in Harbin" was created. The Society carried out all the necessary organizational and preparatory work. And in October 1920 The Russo-Chinese Polytechnic College welcomed its first students - young Russians and Chinese.
   The administration of the Technical College (later transformed into an Institute) included a number of celebrated Russian scientists as well as high municipal officials of Harbin. They adopted the most advanced methods of teaching technical sciences that met the world standards of higher education.
   The paper highlights organization and management of educational processes, describes life and work of students and teachers of the Institute. The Board of the Chinese Eastern railway played a major role in the development of the Institute. For example, the Institute received most advanced equipment for classrooms and research laboratories. The principle of joint management of Harbin Polytechnic Institute by Russian (later on - Soviet) and Chinese citizens became an important factor that had a positive impact on the efficiency of the Institute. Harbin Polytechnic Institute has made a great contribution to the development of higher education in China, being an authoritative educational institution that serves as an example for other Chinese technical universities that train national staff.
   Since its opening, the Institute has changed its structure and name several times due to the needs of economic development and political changes as well, but the history of its activities has been an important page in the history of entire North-East China. Time has shown that the system of higher education established by Russian emigrant scientists was one of the best. Today, celebrating its centenary, Harbin Polytechnic University remains to be one of the most prestigious and popular universities in China.

DE the master-slave dialectic; the end of history; slavery; virtue;
   political animal; logos; Aristotle; Kojeve; animal rationale
AB The article analyzes the course of lectures by Alexandre Kojeve (1933-1939) as a historiographical material for modern Aristotelian studies. Special attention is paid to Kojeve's critical argumentation, which he deploys, comprehending Aristotelian justification of slavery and mastery by nature. It should be considered that Aristotle is not the central figure in these lectures, he is interesting for Kojeve not himself, but in dialectical comparison with Hegel's, historical in its essence, concept of "slave and master". Developing an original philosophy of history, Kojeve criticizes the definitions of man presented by Aristotle in "Politics", but at the same time, he partially accepts the political ideas of Aristotle. According to Kojeve, to be a slave or a master "by nature" means to correspond to one's destiny. But at the same time, it is the masterslave relationship that Kojeve presents as the basis of the historical process. From his point of view, "the struggle for recognition", "historicism and the end of history", "mortal risk", etc. are the concepts that are designed to resolve the contradictions of Aristotle's doctrine of the state. Common to Aristotle and Kojeve is the definition of the essence of man through politics and logos (speech), allowing to comprehend the relationship of slave and master dialectically. The undertaken analysis of this Kojeve's dual relation to Aristotle's ideas allows to reveal a complex of various preconditions, proceeding from which, Kojeve interprets Hegel's philosophy of history.

   OF POLITICS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE justice; liberalism; communitarianism; just law; concept of good; moral
   desert; solidarity
AB The liberal theory of justice proposed by John Rawls was almost immediately criticized by the communitarians. They mainly criticized Rawls' idea about the priority of the law over the good. This article is intended to show that the idea was misunderstood by the communitarians who viewed it as an attempt to put the law above morality and similar forms of social relations. To solve this problem, N.Shaveko focuses on two objections that are usually put forward against this idea: 1) it destroys the bonds of solidarity; and 2) it leaves no room for the requirements of local morality. His analysis clearly demonstrates that Rawls' conception, and the liberal project as a whole, does not diminish the importance of moral ideals and obligations of solidarity, but, on the contrary, creates conditions for their implementation. The need to take into account moral views, which vary across societies, does not mean that certain basic values cannot be prioritized over moral views. The attempts of the communitarians to justify the supremacy of ideas about the good are unconvincing - communitarians themselves in fact adhere to a number of fundamental values and place them above any conception of the good.
   According to the author's conclusion, the communitarian criticism does not undermine the foundations of the Rawls' theory of justice, but, on the contrary, enriches it. The disagreements between the communitarians and the liberals can be partially explained by the incorrect use of the notions of "the concept of good" and "moral desert", as well as by the untenable statement that moral obligations can arise solely through the membership in a particular community, and by the unfounded attempts to ascribe a normative significance to the trivial fact of the interdependence between human being and society and to prove the alleged impossibility of making judgments about justice without defining the goals of various social institutions.

DE Constantine Porphyrogenitus; "De Administrando Imperio"; Byzantium;

ID ADMINISTRANDO-IMPERIO; PORPHYROGENITUS
AB Introduction. The article is a critical essay about an attempt to translate the Constantine's treatise "De Administrando Imperio" into an artificially archaic "Pseudo-Slavic" language, made by R.A. Gimadeev. It is shown that his commentaries accompanying this translation are extremely primitive, the author does not follow scientific methods and he is not familiar with modern scientific literature. This is especially clearly seen, since this publication takes place against the backdrop of a fundamental rethinking in modern Byzantine studies of political history and the system of power organization in the "Eastern Roman Empire" of the 10th century. This rethinking of basic Byzantine issues is vastly based on the re-interpretations and new commenting of the classic text of "De Administrando Imperio". Discussion. In recent years several special articles and monographs have been published, in which the questions about authorship, text structure, stylistics and ideology of the text of "De Administrando Imperio" and related subjects were re-posed. Analysis. For a number of parameters, the text of the introduction and commentaries on the text of the treatise in this new edition made by R.A. Gimadeev is far from the standards of academic writing. His attempts to reason about the paleography of the manuscript and the text's structure are devoid of formal arguments and arbitrary rhetorical in their nature. The translation of the text into some artificial archaic "Slavic Russian Language" does not convey the pragmatics and stylistics of the original, but leads to a distortion of its perception. The uniformity of the principles of translating special vocabulary is not maintained . in some cases, the translator refuses the usual transliterations, in others - he introduces new ones. The publication practically does not take into account modern historiography, partly, apparently, intentionally, but often, out of unfamiliarity with the necessary studies. Perhaps, some ideas of R.A. Gimadeev will be confirmed and find application in the future, but all his observations require the most careful verification. Conclusions. The considered attempt of a new reconstruction of the Greek text of the treatise and its translation by R.A. Gimadeev are not fully scientific and qualified As a result, the new edition turned out to be a kind of historiographical deviation, especially evident against the background of modern studies of this masterpiece of Byzantine literature.

   RELATIONS
SO SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS

DT Article
DE Japan; USA; Japan-US relations; security treaty; Indo-Pacific; trade and
   investment regime; trade agreements; multilateral frameworks
AB Japan - U.S. relations, which are of great importance for the both countries as well as for international relations in North-East Asia and the Indo-Pacific, have experienced significant changes in recent years. While continuing to maintain close military-political alliance with the United States and recognize unconditionally its leadership regarding the choice of strategic course and priorities, Japan is increasingly promoting its own regional policy agenda and its vision of national interests. The main task of its government, headed by Shinzo Abe, is a kind of "rebranding" Japan in political terms as a "normal" country void of negative historical heritage with the ability to employ a full set of foreign policy tools and promote its interests on a regional scale. The said task brings about new accents in Japan's relations with the USA in the sphere of security, in solving regional political problems and regulating mutual trade and investment. At the same time, bilateral relations are viewed by Japan as a complex set where some elements can be used as a tool or traded as parts of a package deal to secure a comprehensive solution.
   The United States, for its part, is focusing on maintaining its role as the undisputed leader, trying to neutralize Japan's attempts to break the framework of the established hierarchical order and change the logic of bilateral relations to that of trading concessions and optimizing complex network balance.
   Since the change of presidential administration in the US in 2017 there has been a marked decay of long-established consensus on the desirability of further liberalization of international trade and investment through multilateral agreements and frameworks. Like other countries, Japan faced a persistent drive by Trump administration to withdraw from them in favor of bilateral agreements on managed and balanced trade. Japan's government had to give in to the US pressure and begin negotiations on a bilateral trade agreement designed to reduce imbalance of trade flows between the two countries through policy steps to be taken mainly by the Japanese side.

However, a few persons understand the essence of this phenomenon, the variety of its manifestations and the reasons for its origin. Currently, there is a tendency that R.

AB Historical experience has shown that sustainable development of the human community in the process of making managerial decisions needs taking into account not only interests of individuals or organizations making these decisions, but also interests, values and goals of wide social groups and society as a whole. This ethical principle is the content of the concept of "social responsibility" - one of the fundamental concepts in social science. The relevance of this principle grows in connection with an increasing role of subjective factor in the socio-historical process. Social responsibility becomes especially important for activities of the most influential social groups. Thus, the increasing impact on society and the environment of the activities of managers and organizers of industrial production has drawn attention to the social responsibility of this social group. Responsibility for the state of society and the natural environment is becoming an important area of social science, the number of studies in this area of scientific knowledge multiplies. Higher education institutions are expanding their teaching courses like "Social Responsibility of Business". At the same time, there is another social group - political elite of society, to whose activity this ethical principle is even more relevant due to its greater influence. The article - starting from the early to the late Soviet period - analyzes nature and forms of social responsibility manifestations of first persons of the state.

AB The article is devoted to an important phenomenon in the history of the Petrograd Philosophical Society, the journal "Mysl''. Authors demonstrate the significance of the journal for the life of this society. The article shows the history of the creation of the journal, as well as the basic principles and forms of organization of its activities, in the specific conditions of Soviet Russia in the early 1920s. A brief analysis of a number of the most interesting articles published in the journal is given. Their authors - famous Russian philosophers were active members of the Philosophical Society: L.P. Karsavin, N.O. Lossky, A.I. Vvedensky, E.L. Radlov, etc. For this purpose, the authors draw on materials from two reviews published in the Soviet periodicals as well as three reviews from emigrant publications. The paper outlines the main political and social reasons for the fact that the period of revival of the Philosophical Society after the revolution of 1917 was short, and it managed to publish only three issues of the journal "Mysl''. According to the authors of the article, in its brief period of post-revolutionary activity, the Philosophical Society successfully positioned itself as one of the centers of philosophical science in Soviet Russia; "Mysl'' is perceived by historians as a unique scientific publication that objectively reflected the state of philosophy of its time.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE motor action theory; Nikolay Bernstein; top-down control;
   self-organization; cybernetics; Moscow Motor School
AB The period from the late 1950s to the mid-1960s in the Soviet Union was known as the "Thaw," a political era that fostered hopes of restoring the rule of law and democracy to the country. In that period cybernetics came to symbolize both scientific progress and social change. The Soviet intelligentsia had survived the hardship of Stalinist repression and now regarded the new discipline, which brought together the natural sciences and the human sciences, as a pathway to building a freer and more equal society. After decades of domination by Pavlovian doctrine, a paradigm shift was under way in physiology and psychology. Cybernetics reinforced the new paradigm, which put forward ideas of purposive behavior and self-organization in living and non-living systems. The conditioned reflex and a simplistic one-to-one view of connections in the nervous system gave way to more sophisticated and complex models, which could be formalized mathematically. Previous models of control in living organisms were mostly hierarchical and included top-down control of peripheral movement by the motor centers. The new models supplemented this picture with feedback commands from the periphery to the center.
   By the time cybernetics had made its appearance in the Soviet Union, new models of control had already been formulated in physiology by Nikolay Bernstein (1896-1966). He termed the feedback from afferent signals "sensorial corrections", meaning that they play an important part in adapting central control to the changing situation at the periphery of movement. The new paradigm emphasized horizontal connections over vertical ones, and new models took hold based on less "totalitarian" and more "democratic" principles, such as the idea of automatic or autonomous functioning of intermediate centers, the mathematical concept of well-organized functions, the theory of "the collective behavior of automata," etc. This line of research was carried out in the USSR as well as abroad by Bernstein's students and followers who formed the Moscow School of Motor Control. 'the author argues that this preference for less hierarchical models was one expression of the Thaw's trend toward liberalization of life within the USSR and greater involvement in international politics.

TI TO THE QUESTION OF THE TERM OF "ETHNIC PUBLIC ASSOCIATIONS"

   UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HISTORY
LA Russian
DT Article
DE national association; ethnic organization; national movement; hometown
   association; expatriate community; national and cultural autonomy;
   ethnic public associations
AB Nowadays, public associations exercise significant influence on the world. Most popular of them, such as Green-peace, LGBT, WJC (World Jewish Congress) could even be serious players in political mainstream. Some of associations were established as organizations that should protect interests of certain cultures, ethnic groups or nations, e.g. WJC or NCAI (National Congress of American Indians). Despite the fact that such organizations are not political parties, they remain key stakeholders in global sociopolitical processes. Contemporary national and foreign science has no equal term that could define and unify such terms as national association (in the meaning of the community uniting representatives of certain ethnic group), ethnic organization, national movement, hometown association, expatriate community (diaspora), national cultural autonomy.
   The first part of this research is focused on the definition of terms "nation", "nationality", "ethnos". Studying different scientific attitudes such as primordialism, constructivism, instrumentalism approaches and theory of ethnos the author draws the conclusion that "ethnos" is the main classification unit. On the other hand, the terms "nation" and "nationality" are more abstract and general. These terms are often used to identify the affiliation with the state, not with a certain ethnic group.
   The second part of the article is devoted to differentiation of such terms as: association, organization and movement. The author concludes that "association" is the most inclusive term which is based on the Federal Law of the Russian Federation "About public associations" and opinions of modern experts in law, ethnology, history and sociology. At the same time "movement" and "organization" are types of association, while hometown association, expatriate community, national cultural autonomy are types of organizations.
   The author examines this scheme in the final part of the paper on the case of ethnic public associations of the Republic of Khakassia introducing the example of the Congress of Khakas People (the CKP). This organization has contributed much to shaping of political and social structure of the Republic. The author also focuses on the activities of other ethnic public associations like Khakass national movement "Tun", the League of Khakass Women "Altynay" and the group of national cultural centers: the Russian-German society "Widergeburt", Ukrainians society "Vatra", Poles center "Polonia", "Center of Azerbaijani Culture", "Georgia", Center of Tajik and Uzbek Culture "Sogdiana", Armenian National Cultural Center "Nairi", Jewish National Cultural Center "Ha-Tikva", "Kyrgyzstan" center, "Association of the Korean Diaspora".
   The author emphasizes in the conclusion that the most correct term to identify the association responsible for promoting interests of different ethnic groups is "ethnic public association".

AB The economic crisis in Spain that began in 2008 led to the deep social discontent that later turned into the movement of "Indignant", citizens tiered of economic restrictions, unemployment, corruption scandals. That movement brought new political parties to the traditional bipolar Spanish political system, destroying it and showing to the establishment that the country needs urgent measures to be taken. The non-confidence motion showed the inability of the mainstream parties to solve the existing problems that collapse the country. That helped a lot to the appearance of a new populist party called Podemos that offered immediately simple solutions to the national economic challenges. Unfortunately and logically becoming the third party in Spain didn't help to Podemos to solve all the current problems and it was obliged to give way to another young party - Ciudadanos. The party that originally was created to defend the rights of Spanish people in Catalonia soon realized the need to reach the national scale to be heard and for this purpose created a program of social and economic reforms for the whole country. The study sets out to analyze the reasons of the success of new Spanish parties as well as to compare their programs and watch the new vector of political evolution in Spain.

DT Book Review
DE statistics in the USSR; Stalinism; Oreshkin; hagiography;
   collectivization; railway transport; great Patriotic war
AB The reinterpretation of the Soviet experiment during Perestroika failed by most accounts. Yet most Russians still have trouble recognizing the essential flaws of the economic and political system that emerged in the USSR in the first years of Soviet power. These people still magically believe in the power of Stalin, whose name is, by no accident, used in the title of the book. Even the attempts to reform the regime in 1953 and, especially, after 1985 are considered by many as a crime, and their initiators (Khrushchev, Gorbachev, Yeltsin) as state criminals who should be put on trial. This book argues that the primary reason behind this 'magic' is the masterful virtual reality that was created and maintained in the USSR on the basis of Communist ideology, a reality that was maintained using a wide range of tools, primarily statistical. The discrepancies between the planned indicators and the real achievements are investigated by the author using examples of railway construction, the collectivization of agriculture, laying of channels, etc. In cases when figures presented to the party leadership did not square well with the ideological guidelines, physical elimination was frequently used to get rid of those who fell out of favor (the most striking example concerns the repressions against the organizers of the population census of the USSR in 1937). These same people were also often blamed for the failures in economic and social policy. The author concludes that the continuing perception of the country's past through the prism of such hagiography is an obstacle to the development of modern Russia.

AB This research focuses on the features and transformations of power groups and their role in the political life of the societies of the Baltic countries. This article aims to analyse structural and functional changes in the composition of the Baltic political elites after these countries gained independence in the 1990s. The main objective of this research is to reveal the general and the specific in the transformations of Latvian, Lithuanian, and Estonian elites. Changes in the structure of power groups are considered on a subregional scale in view of the current Russian-Baltic political interaction. The common and distinctive features in the transformations of Latvian, Lithuanian, and Estonian elites are identified. Quantitative methods of analysis are used to detect trends in the selection of channels and mechanisms of elite recruitment. The study of power groups concentrated on both large-scale socio-political transformations and individual practices. A comprehensive examination of elite transformation in small states such as the Baltics requires the consideration of both domestic and foreign policy aspects. The thesis is put forward that despite some differences between the Baltic States their political elites have undergone very similar transformations since the 1990s. At the time, Baltic elites asserted continuity with pre-war Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia and detachment from the Soviet past. The 1990s elite struggle for power led to sharp ethnic, linguistic and political divides in Baltic societies. These rifts limit competition between power groups and reduce the ability of political systems to renew themselves. Having reached the 'back to the West' goal, Baltic elites replaced it with the idea of 'Russian threat'. Bridging internal divides, which may weaken the power of the elites, was postponed as a result.

TI VOX POPULI - VOX DEI: ELECTIONS IN THE ROMAN REPUBLIC AND MODERN
   DEMOCRACIES (COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS)
SO NOVYI ISTORICHESKII VESTNIK-THE NEW HISTORICAL BULLETIN
LA English
DT Article
DE Roman Republic; elections; legitimation; democracy; ritual; media;
   aleatory procedure
AB The article provides a comparative analysis of ancient and modern technologies for the legitimation of political power, using the example of the Roman Republic and the currently existing democracies. The focus is on the electoral procedure that unites to the utmost the direct (in ancient times) and representative (in modern times) democratic systems. In ancient Rome, in legitimating the electoral procedure the predominant role was played by religious acts, viz. two divination procedures to reveal the will of the gods (auspicia). One was held right before an election and the other during its course, ending with the annunciation of the voting result (renuntiatio). This was the key act in the procedure of electing new magistrates, without which an election was considered invalid regardless of its actual result. The procedure of announcing the voting results actually retains the ritual function of legitimation in modern democracies as well. This mission is assigned, as a rule, to representatives of the election commissions. In the modern world, the ancient Roman religious rituals have an analogy in the form of public opinion polls and political forecasts on the eve of elections which have acquired a ritual legitimizing character in modern democracies. During elections in ancient Rome, a decisive influence on the voting results was exerted by drawing of lots which determined the sequence for casting votes. Modern states, too, try to enhance their legitimation by introducing the aleatory (by lot) form of democratic procedures. Thus, the methods of legitimation of ancient and modern democracies have a certain similarity in the ritual support of the electoral process and in the preservation of the practice of choosing by lot in the electoral procedure. But the legitimating practices of modern democracy have been supplemented with the foreign policy factor, which did not exist in ancient Rome. Also, there was no powerful information pressure in the Roman Republic as there was no media. Today's democracy is increasingly metamorphosing into mediacracy - a form of government where the interests of political actors are closely intertwined with the interests of media conglomerates.

AB Ho Chi Minh was a teacher, scholar and journalist during his work at the Comintern (1923-1938). This period is characterized by Ho Chi Minh's activites not only in the Soviet Union, but in China, Siam and European countries too.
   As undergraduate, postgraduate and teacher, Ho Chi Minh attended all the three Comintern educational establishments, the Communist University of the Working People of the East (CUWPE), the International Lenin School (ILS), and the Research Institute for National and Colonial Issues (RINCI). He delivered lectures on organizational matters, history of the party, geography and history of Vietnam; he took up a postgraduate course in the subject of the agrarian revolution in Southeast Asian countries.
   In the first half of the 1920s he published his articles and essays in the Soviet press (the newspapers Pravda, Gudok, Bakinsky rabochy (Baku Worker), the magazine Rabotnitsa (Working Woman)), as well as in foreign editions (Le Paria, L'Humanite, La vie ouvriere). The main subjects of his publications were 1) the workers movement in the Far East in colonial and dependent countries; 2) publicizing the achievements of the nascent Land of Soviets, its assistance to colonial peoples.
   In those years Ho Chi Minh completed work on the book The Trial of French Colonialism (1925), prepared a brochure entitled The Way of Revolution (1925), and a series of documentary travel sketches called The Diary of a Shipwreck (1930-1931), as well as other journalistic pieces.

TI New in US-Canadian Relations and Ratification of the USMCA Agreement
SO MGIMO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE NAFTA; USMCA; free trade; America First; political competition in the
   United States; D.Trump; J. Trudeau; American-Canadian relations
AB The article reviews through chronological analysis key issues in US-Canadian relations in the context of new trade agreement USMCA replacing NAFTA during Trump's presidency. It identifies a new model of relations between the closest North American partners in the context of a new paradigm which is called "America First". This model leads to a crisis the US-Canadian relations, which is aggravated by the increased partisan rivalry in light of the upcoming US presidential elections, the impeachment process initiated in the House of Representatives.
   The article comes to the following conclusions. The evolutionary development of the free trade agreement (NAFTA), its rejection and acceptance of the USMCA preferential agreement is a gradual and consistent process of protecting North American countries from global market, which started during the presidency of George W. Bush and continued by the subsequent American presidents. This is also connected with the trade war between the United States and China, that was repeatedly emphasized both in the US Administration and in the Congress during D. Trump's presidency. The United States-Canadian relations have worsened significantly, although the countries' leaders do not recognize it publicly during the agreement's preparation and its ratification, for almost three years. The USMCA agree-ment is not a final version, subject to further ratification. It took more than a year for the parties to find compromise solutions on the USMCA with the protocols' preparation to the agreement and its submission to the national parliaments. Moreover, in the agreed version, the USMCA agreement meets primarily the interests of the United States.The US pressure on Canada was unprecedented. As a result, we should expect the continued growth of political and trade contradictions between the United States and Canada, as well as the revision and addition of new additional agreements in the USMCA agreement.

AB Introduction. Studies of American historians on the Civil War and Reconstruction continue to be central issues in the 21st century. There is an increased public demand for these studies. The author of the analytical review of American publications tries to answer the question of what this interest is related to. Methods. The author of the review uses the methodological tools such as the scientific principle of objectivity, the special historical-comparative method and the systematic approach to answer this question. Analysis. The author points out the main areas of studying new aspects marked by American historians of the mid-19th century. These areas include the issues and interpretations on military, political, everyday, anthropological, social and cultural, and economic history. Besides, new approaches in peer-reviewed monographs for the comprehensive coverage of the study material of this issue are highlighted. Results. The interest of academicians and the American public to studying the historical period of the Civil War and Reconstruction, on the one hand, tells about carrying the deep psycho-civilizational trauma by all subsequent generations of both white and black Americans at this time, and on the other hand, this war debunks the myth of God's chosen destiny of the American nation to build a "City on a Hill". Constant refinements, additions, revisions, and reinterpretations of the events and consequences of the Civil War and Reconstruction in contemporary American historiography only confirm this conclusion. The publications selected by the reviewer on this issue for 2019 not only introduce new American historical works to Russian Americanists, but also provide an opportunity to expand their own research on this issue.

TI The Culmination of the Miners' Protest Movement in Russia During the
   Transition to Market Relations
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Russia; market relations; miners; climax; "rail wars"
AB The topic of the research is the culmination of the miners' protest movement in Russia, which falls on May 1998. The central place in this phenomenon belonged to the all-Russian "rail wars" when the most important railways were blocked. Their main motive was multi-month delays in wage payments. The authors draw attention to the fact that the all-Russian protest swept all coal industrial areas of the country. However, the main events took place in the leading coal basins: the Pechora coal basin (where they blocked the Northern Railway), Kuzbass (where they blocked the Trans-Siberian Railway), the Russian Donbass (where they blocked the North Caucasus Railway). The protesters' main demands focused around political slogans, among which stood out the resignation of Russian President Boris Yeltsin and the nationalisation of the coal industry. The analysis of the sources and literature leads to the following important conclusions. Transport blockades over several days (from May 13 to May 21) became very popular among Russians. The peak point was 22-23 May, when the All-Russian "rail wars" directly threatened the country's national security. Therefore, the President and the Government of Russia established a dialogue with the protesters. People in the coal industrial areas of the country began to receive money to pay off wage arrears. This made it possible to reduce tensions in the coal mining regions and to divert miners from political slogans. Ambiguous was the attitude of Russians to the radical forms of struggle. In the conditions of a large, unevenly developed economy and transport system, "raising the people" to protest using "rail wars" turned out to be an overwhelming task for the miners. Coal industry enterprises suffered large losses from transport blockades. This led to a rapid decline in the miners' protest movement in Russia. The authors come to the conclusion that the results of the culmination of the miners' protest movement in Russia during the transition to market relations were mixed. The authorities and administrations made concessions, but to a greater extent they were of a socio-economic nature. The low effectiveness of the confrontation, the high economic costs and the ambiguity of public opinion forced the coal industry workers to abandon such a radical form of upholding labour rights and interests as the "rail war". This is evidenced by the unsuccessful attempt of the Kuzbass miners to reanimate this form of protest at an all-Russian scale undertaken in July 1998.

TI "The Grand Retinue" Phenomenon in Northern and Eastern Europe in the
   10-11th Centuries
SO ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS FROM SCYTHIA TO SIBERIA
LA English
DT Article
DE Middle Ages; military organization; political structure; retinue;
   comparative analysis
AB The author summarizes evidence of large professional armies in the service of the rulers of early medieval polities in Northern and Eastern Europe. Following Frantisek Graus, the author refers to that institution as "grand retinue" (Czech velkodruzina, German Staatsgefolge). The rulers maintained these troops mainly by paying in cash collected as tribute from the populace. The late 10th-early 11th-century Poland and the "North Sea Empire" of Cnut the Great (1016-1035) provide the most compelling evidence on the grand retinue. In the 10-11th centuries Rus', the princes also had armies of military servants, referred to as otroki (a Slavic word) or - more specifically - grid' (term borrowed from Old Norse). Such troops played a major role during the emergence of the centralized political framework, but have disappeared or degenerated as early as the 12th century. Rus'ian records describe them as prosperous in the 11th century and show their decline during the 12-13th centuries. I interpret the Rus'ian "grand retinue" as an institution based on Scandinavian models, a result of the "transfer of knowledge" that occurred in Northern and Eastern Europe during the 10-11th centuries.

DE marginality models; risk of marginalization; marginality modeling;
   criminal subculture; limit behavior
AB The research analyzes different models of marginality in historical-legal and political-legal contexts. The relevance of the study is due to the significant risks of spreading marginality in modern society, as a prerequisite for legal anomia. Understanding marginality, as one of the destructive forms of legal awareness and legally significant limiting behavior, allows marginality to be modeled historically and theoretically in relation to sociocultural phenomena such as state and law. At the methodological level, documentary design was used close to historicalresearch and epistemological reflection typical of interdisciplinary dialogue. It is concluded that the use of legal means and techniques to combat marginality is based on the hypothesis of legal consciousness, according to which anyone initially focuses on consciousness, socially active and useful, and therefore on lawful behavior established by law. This approach can be formed, strengthened, or restored through the implementation of educational, ideological, and other functions of law, political science, or history.

AB Using the example of epistolary sources extracted from the fund No. 5 "Apparatus of the Central Committee of the CPSU (1949-1991)" of the Russian State Archive of Contemporary History, the problem of the history of the personnel policy development in the USSR, that is insufficiently covered in historical science, is examined in the article. The circumstances that had developed by the mid-1970s in the light of the decree of the Central Committee of the CPSU of February 12, 1975 "On the state of criticism and self-criticism in the Tambov Regional Party Organization" are described. The question is raised about the transformation of the Party-Soviet nomenclature, its social orientations and moral guidelines. The results of a comparative analysis of letters from various regions of the USSR are presented. On their basis the conclusions about the socialist ideals of Soviet citizens and the psychology of individualism contrary to them, the mentality of accumulation, which are affirmed among the political elite, are drawn. The circumstances of the embourgeoisement of regional leaders, personal corruption, especially abuse in the exercise of property rights, are commented. It is stated that gradually illegal actions, in the absence of strict measures to dismiss executives from their posts, became systemic, taking the form of custom. The author comes to the conclusion that the political space, socio-economic structure and the spiritual and moral sphere of society have evolved towards consumer, private ownership, property interests and needs.

AB The geopolitical situation in the modern world has a significant impact on the processes of globalization. We cannot but recognize that the dynamically changing conditions of the modern world community directly affect the economic, political, social and cultural spheres of individual states. Various events of world or national scale, change of regimes and governments, religious disagreements and wars, territorial conflicts and confrontations, crises in power structures, even the characteristic behavior of public personalities- all this imposes their peculiarities on the vector of development of the economy of the country. This is an objectively existing attribute of globalization, manifested as a phenomenon of gigantic world "melting pot". However, the tendency of fading of inter-ethnic and interstate borders, which has always been characteristic of globalization processes is seriously resisted from the part of some countries, regions or politicians. The phenomena of unification and identification derive everywhere, intersecting or going parallel to each other. That is, on the one hand, there is an increase in the openness of the world economy, the merging of cultural and social spheres, on the other hand, there is a course on localization, which approves the national uniqueness of countries. This trend is reinforced by the uneven distribution of economic resources in a wide range of factors: natural, physical, geographic, social, historical, ethnic and others. Consequently, diversification of the economic structure of a number of countries predetermines their place in the world ranking. In such circumstances, increasing the competitiveness of the national economy in any state is put in a number of priority tasks, which contribute to the strengthening of positions in the world economy and ensuring the necessary level of economic security.
   The methodology of this research is based on the analysis of common scientific approaches to modern socio-economic problems. In particular, the widely adapted method of descriptions of processes with the use of historical comparisons and generalizations by means of dialecticalmaterialistic analysis. In the course of the research various variants of combinations of means of scientific cognition were used, namely analysis, synthesis, comparison, systematization, classification and others. Thus, the presentation of the authors ' point of view is based on confirmation of the existing theory of principles of systematic approach to the study of processes and phenomena in modern global economic life. Empirical Base is based on official statistics, facts of periodicals and results of personal researches of authors.

AB This article is a study devoted to the scientific direction that existed in the 30-40-s in the system of general pedagogy - pedology. The article examines the origins of interest in the scientific and comprehensive study of childhood, the history of the emergence and development of pedology abroad and in Russia. In this study, the emergence of pedology in Russia is interpreted by the authors as a response to the growing interest of social and humanitarian knowledge in the personality of the child and the spread of the ideas of humanism that came to Russia from the West. However, due to the prevailing social, political conditions, as well as objective reasons that are analyzed in the work, pedology was abolished and the interdisciplinary study of childhood was suspended for a long time. The presented material also provides an analytical overview of the main directions of the formation of pedology as an academic subject for pedagogical educational institutions in the period of the 30-s - 40-s. The sources used were educational programs and textbooks on pedology, works of pedologists of the 30-s - 40-s, articles from the journal "Pedology", documents of the People's Commissariat of Education and archival materials. In addition, the article attempts to highlight the range of pedological problems relevant to the modern educational system.

AB A pioneering attempt in historiography presents a scientific analysis of socio-humanitarian research carried out by employees of the USSR Academy of Sciences in the Arctic regions of Yakutia during 1980-1991. Archival materials identified by the author, as well as data from the scientific literature were used for the preparation of the article. The work carried out allowed us to present a characteristic of the development by scientists of a complex of sociocultural, economic, archaeological, historical and anthropological, linguistic and folklore issues. In this regard, the geography of the research is shown, their key actors and main directions are identified. At the same time, an analysis of the most important provisions developed by the participants of the considered research initiatives was carried out. It was established that in the mentioned period, on the one hand, the research was continued, which had been successfully carried out earlier in the Polar Yakutia, and on the other hand, new research trends were making their way. Their stipulation is proved by the development of scientific knowledge and the changing socio-political situation in the Soviet Union. It is concluded that, as a result, interdisciplinary research has been developed, including the widespread use of the natural science arsenal, as well as a clear shift in the paradigm regarding the assessment of Soviet transformations for the destiny of the indigenous peoples of the North.

DE models of interaction between power and society; public chambers;

AB The article analyzes the logic of transforming public chambers from the point of view of: a) the principles of organization and selection of staff, b) the functionality laid down in the regulatory framework, c) the measures taken reflecting the content and focus of the work, d) the information policy, e) building relationships with public organizations, state authorities and local self-government, and f) the influence on the socio-political situation in the region. The main research methods used were an analysis of the regulatory framework, content from the Public Chamber of the Tver Region and St. Petersburg, and semi-structured interviews with chamber members, experts, government officials and deputies of regional parliaments with experience in interacting with public chambers. An analysis of the principles of organization and the functionality of public chambers shows that the potential for their influence on public policy in the law is limited. The authors highlight the general and specific features of the evolution of the public chambers of the Tver region and St. Petersburg. If the Public Chamber of the Tver Region was initially created as a real institute of regional policy, with the levers of influence prescribed in law on the process of making power decisions (the right of legislative initiative, the possibility of sending representatives to the qualification collegium of judges), the Public Chamber of St. Petersburg was created as a kind of elite club under the governor with which the governor could consult if desired. General changes regarding public chambers are moving towards adjusting the principles of their recruitment, numerical strength, the study of individual powers, and the unification of the system of regional public chambers. An analysis of the activities of the public chambers allows the authors to conclude that they correlate with changes in the domestic policy of the Russian Federation. According to the authors, this public-state institution contributes to the activation of those social forces that are ready to integrate into communication to promote socially oriented projects. The authors believe that the genesis and evolution of public chambers in Russia throughout the 2000s indicates a change in the mechanisms of interaction between civil society structures and the state, as well as the design of a paternalistic model of mediation of power and society.

DT Article
DE Middle East; Egypt; authoritarian regimes; leadership; charisma;
   reforms; Arab Spring; Weber; Gramshi
AB The article deals with authoritarian regimes based on charismatic leadership which can be also called caesarean. It analyzes the existing caesarean regimes of the Middle East and North Africa: their nature (progressive vs. conservative), characteristic features and prospects of their evolution. To achieve this goal the author uses a synthetic analytical approach based on ideas of Max Weber and Antonio Gramshi. This approach includes analysis of a number of key factors, such as conditions for eruption of a charismatic leader ('Caesar'), sources of legitimization, mechanisms of control and power transit, progressive or conservative nature of the regime, potential for turning the caesarean regime into a permanent one based on tradition of charismatic rule. The main conclusion of the paper is that the Middle East and North Africa are witnessing the arrival of the third generation of charismatic leaders, who will follow conservative instead of progressive agenda. On the regional scale it will bring relative stability to international relations (at least among the Arab states) while at domestic level the pressure of unresolved political, economic and social problems will be mounting resulting in a new wave of revolutions and instability in the midterm.

DE Russian literature of the XIX century; the founder of Komi literature;
   poet; peasant heroes; image; theme
AB Introduction: the name of I. Kuratov, an outstanding Komi poet of the XIX century, is well known in the Finno-Ugric world. In his work, he relied on the Komi oral poetry, developing national cultural and linguistic tradition. On the other hand, his poetry was created under the influence of Russian and world literature. Among the manuscripts of I. Kuratov, there are notes about Russian classics, and in the works of literary criticism there are many comments about German, Italian, English and Scottish poets. Therefore the question of the connections of poetry I. Kuratov with the works of Russian and Western European writers occurs naturally - these are common themes, the coincidence of key motifs, similar ways of creation of characters.
   Objective: To investigate in a comparative aspect the works of the Komi poet I. Kuratov and the classics of Russian poetry of the XIX century, to identify the similarities and originality of image system, theme, and key motifs in their creative works.
   Research materials: poetic works of I. Kuratov and Russian poets of the XIX century.
   Results and novelty of the research: in the Russian literature of the XIX century, writers raised a new question for that time - the question of the liberation of the people, whose life was studied as one of the universal values. I. Kuratov in his work was in tune with the national literature of the time. However, he does not copy the plots and poetics of the works of Russian poets, as well as he does not translate them. Based on the achievements of Russian lyrics, I. Kuratov creates original characters of the Komi.
   A comparative analysis of I. Kuratov's lyrics and the classics of Russian literature allow us to overcome the inertia of perception of his works in the focus of the socio-political sound assigned to them, to expand the understanding of the features of artistic expression of the Komi poet's axiological installations. The comparative analysis also allows us to expand the understanding of the broad connections and interaction of I. Kuratov's poetry with the Russian literary tradition.

DT Article
DE Archival documents of the Stalin era; letters to power as a historical
   source; Great Terror; purge of the NKVD; ego-documents; "letters to
   power"; models of self-advocacy
AB The article reviews the third, final publication in the documentary series "Echo of the Great Terror," dedicated to the purge campaign in the ranks of the NKVD. In total, the book compiled by historians A. Savin, A. Teplyakov, and M. Junge includes more than 300 documents that form two sections of the collection. The first section contains self-describing narratives created by security officers and their family members during the NKVD purge campaign, the second one includes sets of heterogeneous documents reconstructing the general context. The reviewer notes that the most interesting part of the publication is the one presenting ego-texts, since they allow us to see the "cleansing of the cleaners" through the eyes of the Chekists themselves. According to the reviewer, their "letters to power" (petitions, statements, appeals, suicide notes) and autobiographies should not be classified as classical ego-documents. Belonging to the category of so-called "provoked ego-documents," they, in no small part, reflected the authors' desire to adhere to "correct" rituals, rhetoric, and symbols of their political era. Striving to dissociate themselves from incriminated violations of "socialist legality," Stalin's Chekists used various self-justifying models or combinations thereof. But the reviewer is of the opinion that the most important thing reflected in the Chekists' messages was their willingness to search for and find enemies, even within their own ranks. It was this willingness, the reviewer concludes, that was the basis of group professional identity of the Chekist strata and it directly correlated with the positive Soviet identity in general. Thus, ego-documents published in the book capture the fact that Soviet society and its elite was subject to complex processes of isolation and self-determination of "small" social groups, the status of which was determined by their proximity to and inclusion into power.

AB The "long nineteenth century" was marked by radical changes in the social and political life of Western countries. The main principles of development were the implementation of liberal reforms and widespread dissemination of liberal values. Meanwhile, the development of liberal principles sometimes encountered resistance from conservative forces. In the Wake of the anti-revolutionary reaction in France after the July revolution of 1830, the political doctrine of legitimism was developed. The purpose of the article is to study the discussions taking place in French historical science regarding the essence of legitimism, its influence on the political life of the country and the prospects for its development. The article concludes that while some researchers interpret legitimism as an archaic political movement whose leaders were not able to respond to the challenges of the time, other historians consider legitimism as a political trend that played an important role in the political life of France until the end of the 19th century, noting that over time the Legitimists were able to adapt to the changed situation and develop a program adequate to the needs of a modernizing society. The study of this problem allows us to fill in the gaps in Russian historiography, which did not pay serious attention to the study of these issues.

DE Marie-Caroline; Duchess of Berry; the Vendee uprising of 1832; the July
   monarchy; the Vendee in historical memory; king Louis-Philippe of
   Orleans; legitimism
AB The events of the Vendee war of 1793-1796 are deeply studied in French historiography, but they are still the subject of serious not only scientific, but also ideological disputes for French historians. The word "Vendee" itself eventually became a household name, becoming a symbol of opposition to the French revolution. Vendee did not end in the XVIII century, and the region lives on the events of that war to this day, so the famous French historians, a major specialist in the history of Vendee J.-K. Martin calls the war in Vendee "endless". In the course of the "Hundred days" there was a "second edition" of the Vendee. The July revolution of 1830 and the rise to power of king Louis-Philippe d'Orleans again turned Vendee into a stake in the political game. The unsuccessful and, by and large, doomed to failure of the Vendee uprising of 1832 (or the fifth Vendee war may 24-June 12, 1832), went down in history and acquired a romantic flair in large part because of the participation of the Duchess Mary-Caroline of Berry, which is dedicated to this essay. The article analyzes the personality of Mary-Caroline of Berry, briefly traces the course of the revolt in Vendee in 1832. and the results are made about the reasons for his defeat.

AB The article is devoted to the analysis of the book "Napoleon and de Gaulle: two French heroes" by the famous French historian, a major specialist in the history of the French revolution, the Consulate and the First Empire, Patrice Gueniffey, published by Perrin in 2017 and awarded a number of prizes. The article analyzes the content of the book by P. Gueniffey and concludes that it is not only a book about the main characters of the French Pantheon of heroes of the past, but also about historical memory and its structure, about the processes, taking place in the modern society, its relationship with the past - and about historical education. Moreover, P. Gueniffey's book is about the history of France in the broadest sense. Patrice reconstructs through his characters the great and dramatic pages of national history. It is concluded that the monograph of P. Gueniffey, which raises questions about society's reinterpretation of its heroes, can be useful not only for specialists in the history of France, but also for historians, political scientists, and sociologists, reflecting on the fates of heroes of national history.

ID VIEWS
AB The concept of "national identity" is one of the most popular constructs linking political theory and policy agents' requests intended to maintain socio-political order in general, and to legitimize policy in particular. This aspect of legitimacy as explored through the national identity issue engages our attention in this review. The authors explore this aspect as applied to the problem of classical political order, focusing on state capacities and policymaking, accompanied rhetorically by a national identity discourse and based on common values, beliefs, and models of behavior. The review starts from a skepticism towards state capabilities and its claim to monopolize reproduction of a socio-political order which appeals to a volatile idea of a "nation." This is an obvious case for political philosophy and the social sciences, and also a strong example to illustrate the complexities that states face in the "colonizing" of a public sphere. The complexities are particularly expressed in a growing uncertainty of all statutes of identity-politics agents. The article emphasizes that precisely because of the "colonization" strategy, a "nation" eludes a state that loses its reference points such as "order" or "stability." The authors conclude that a policy of such a style described above will always be emasculated and fail to provide any kind of social integration.

TI Oswald Spengler and German Historicism
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL

DT Article
DE Oswald Spengler; The Decline of the West; German historicism
AB The aim of the article is to consider the problem of the correlation between the categories of Oswald Spengler's cultural-historical and political conception with the basic methodological and political principles of German historicism. The sources of the study are Spengler's works. As a research method, a comparative historical method is used, which makes it possible to consider Spengler's cultural, historical and political concepts in the context of German historicism. The past century, since the publication of the first volume of The Decline of the West, showed an unabated interest in Spengler's intellectual heritage, which is based on the fact that the author is rightfully considered to be the ancestor of the civilisational concept in the study of history. Despite the fact that Spengler criticised the preceding humanitarian tradition, his theoretical-methodological and political views were completely in line with German historicism. The latter was a form of special ideological, theoretical, methodological and political state of German humanitarian thought, which considered history from a certain angle as the existence of autonomous, individual, unique phenomena differing from natural entities in cognitive methods, and having a dialectical development. Despite the fact that Spengler criticised the traditional academic historical science, he remained within the framework of the basic principles of German historicism. In an effort to destroy the progressive image of the 19th-century history, he returned to this image in the form of "heroic pessimism" of a man of Western civilisation. He separated natural and historical being into world-as-nature and world-as-history, rejected a natural science approach in explaining history, and, at the same time, while mocking the principle of dialectics, he still likened the rhythm of historical development to a biological natural rhythm. The authors come to the conclusion that, not accepting Eurocentrism, according to his ideas, as a representative of Western culture the only one remaining in history, Spengler largely remained on Euro centric positions. The author of The Decline of the West brought to a logical conclusion the principle of individualisation of historical phenomena, expanding it to the size of a giant cultural-historical type, which he masterfully described in the style of German historicism. In the political doctrine, Spengler spoke as an apologist for the national state, based on estate-corporate principles. Despite the fact that The Decline of the West and other Spengler's works formally go beyond the framework of German historicism, his cultural historical and political concept was an attempt to revise its basic ideological and theoretical-methodological values and principles in the conditions of the crisis of historicism.

ID IDENTITY PROCESSES; TERMINOLOGY; DISCOURSES; CONTEXT
AB In the first decades of the twenty-first century there has been a notable surge of scholarly interest in the problems of intellectual history, the issues of the Scientific Revolution in both Natural sciences and Humanities which still stay ahead of the curve. Such renowned researchers as P. Dear, S. Shapin, D. Wootton, and others are contributing to the study of changes in the minds of European intellectuals including their methods and their philosophical comprehension of the world. The monograph by Mara van der Lugt dedicated to the works of an eminent philosopher and writer of the early Enlightenment Pierre Bayle (1647-1706) is a major contribution to the vast Baylean studies which amount to hundreds of papers. The heritage of Bayle is put into political, religious, intellectual, and methodological contexts, including the complicated system of links and relations within the European Republic of Letters. The researcher suggests "a new way of reading Bayle", which enables to raise and analyze a wide range of problems relating to Bayle's "Historical and Critical Dictionary". Another interesting methodological approach is the use of the figure of Bayle's friend-antagonist Pierre Jurieu (1637-1713) as a sort of a semantic pivot, which simplifies the process of structuring and analyzing the enormous textual material. But, however solid and grounded the monograph is, it requires a number of critical comments given in the present review.

AB The paper is written in continuation of the discussion on the realistic turn in modern philosophy of science. It is noted that the problem of preserving a person's ability to culture-forming differences - between reality and illusion, truth and falsehood in legal science is associated with the distinction between justice and injustice. It offers a critical evaluation of relativistic tendencies in legal science, under the influence of which the law acquires a voluntaristic nature and is understood as a "right of the strong", that leads to blurring the boundaries between legal and political tradition. The problem of truth in legal science is considered through the example of two conceptions of truth developed in the criminal procedure doctrine - objective truth and legal (formal) truth, behind each of which there is a certain idea of reality and the possibilities of its cognition - realistic and relativistic, respectively. The absence of differences between the truth of the empirical proposal about the facts and its evidence in the concept of legal truth leads to the fact that the truth is identified with the force of argumentation, and the court turns into an object of persuasive influence of the participants of the process. The case of Dmitry Karamazov is given as an example of pragmatics of argumentation on the basis of the concept of formal truth. It is noted that the relativistic practices of dealing with reality and truth are reminiscent of the realities of Orwell's novel "1984", and the question of truth and the assumption of objective reality is connected with human freedom.

AB The article, setting the aphoristic Latin quotation "Omnis ars imitatio est naffirae" as an example, shows the historical succession of the ideas of ancient Rome and Renaissance Europe. The thoughts of Seneca (junior) that the height of human happiness does not lie in material wealth, but in living in accordance with the laws of nature, found their continuation in the oeuvre of Marcus Aurelius, who believed that all art, the best examples of human creativity were, in essence, a reflection of the true nature of things, imitating nature, as much as possible in accordance with its laws. Based on this idea, the outstanding English scientist and politician F. Bacon described it as a rule that should be guided in practical, political activity. The article reveals the rational and instrumental meaning of this rule and its relevance/

AB The article provides a historical and philosophical analysis of various ways of perceiving the Great Patriotic War, which are sealed in the heritage of the two Russian thinkers immigrants - Semen Frank (1877-1950) and Bruno Becker (1885-1968). Based on the creative and epistolary heritage of Becker and Frank, which is currently stored in various American and European archives, their positions are reconstructed in relation to the main participants in the military confrontation of the last century, as well as the internal logic of these positions are revealed, which was due to both biographical circumstances and worldviews of both thinkers. In many ways Becker's position seems to be exceptional, not only he saw the danger posed by the new political regime in Germany earlier than many other Russian emigrant philosophers, including Frank, but also he tried to resist this by public and charitable activities in the Netherlands in the prewar and wartime periods.

AB The article presents a review of the monograph by K.A.Soloviev, "The Political System of the Russian Empire in 1881-1905: Problem of Lawmaking." The book is devoted to the routine political process in the late imperial Russia and, in essence, contains political analysis that has dived into the past. According to A.Tumanova, Soloviev's major innovation consists in abandoning the established interpretation of political history as a presentation of events in a chronological order and in shifting the focus from legislative acts and agents who played a major role in their preparation to institutions models of organizations' functioning, formal and informal practices that determined the scope of their political activity and mechanisms of interaction, rather than organizations per se.
   Soloviev's monograph talks about the strength and weakness of the autocratic-bureaucratic model of governance. This study can be considered exemplary due to its fundamental nature, the scale of the scientific problems, the depth of the analysis of the historical sources and the style of historical writing. The book also raises a wide range of important contemporary questions: is there a public field of politics under an autocratic regime? What is the meaning of legality under an absolute monarchy? How do feedback mechanisms between government and society work? How does the system of checks and balances in an autocratic state work? Who, in addition to state institutions, is involved in lawmaking? Does bureaucracy represent the state and to what extent is it in solidarity with state power? What is the reason for the stability of the "bureaucratic empire" and what is its vulnerability?

AB The review discusses a book written by Nic Cheeseman and Brian Klaas "How to Rig an Election" (New Haven, London: Yale University Press, 2019). Based on field research, conducted by authors themselves in countries across sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia, and secondary sources they demonstrate the variety of manipulative tools at the disposal of authoritarian incumbents. Besides describing the authoritarian toolbox, authors pay attention to the ways of strengthening electoral integrity both in authoritarian and democratic regimes. "How to Rig an Election" neither puts forward nor tests empirically any research hypotheses. At the same time, the book proposes some new research questions for the further studying. What factors influence the incumbents' choice of given manipulative tools during an election? Whether disinformation in social media and fake news affect voters' electoral behavior? The book, aimed primarily at a wide audience, will be useful to anyone interested in authoritarian elections, the politics of electoral malpractice and electoral integrity. For those who are deeply familiar with the literature on comparative authoritarianism, the content of the book will be uninformative.

AB For the first time, an attempt has been made to source-based analysis of materials on musical subjects of the "Slavs" magazine, the press organ of the transnational anti-fascist All-Slavic Committee in the conditions of the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945. The relevance of Slavic musical problems in the socio-political and research terms is shown. Officially approved personalities of outstanding musicians, including opinion leaders - contemporaries of the war, whose names are found on the pages of the magazine, are revealed. It has been established that the attribution of most information units on musical art issues published in the magazine is difficult. Socially significant musical events in the country and abroad highlighted in the magazine, having local and international resonance: the premiere of the Seventh Symphony of D. D. Shostakovich, performances, concerts, accompaniment of various political and scientific events, etc. are singled out. The diverse use of the Slavic cultural potential in the musical sphere is shown. The main national informational musical and cultural vectors reflected in the publications (Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Czech, Polish) are determined. The key contexts of the magazine's publications are noted - the struggle against the common enemy - fascist Germany, the liberation and restoration of the culture of the Slavic countries.

AB The research rationale is a significant increase in the need for energy resources and their irrational use. The world should follow the path of implementing the innovative energy concept. The basis of its long-term development is not only mining, production, and export of traditional energy carriers, but also their substantial rationalization based on the latest scientific achievements, which would ensure the development of a new energy system and provide energy consumption quality while maintaining the indigenous environment. The global future development vision of the world energy buildout should be based on the predicted changes in the economy and the consumer society, which form the demand for energy products and services, as well as on its defining requirements, setting its social and political development priorities. The possibilities of changing the global energy system (financial, organizational, and technological), which is forced to adapt to qualitatively new demands, cannot be overlooked as well. Even the most developed states' efforts are not enough to solve this task in case if they are single forces. The whole world community should be concerned about this and mobilize resources for building the innovative energy future. An urgent task is the institutional regulation of energy conversion processes on an interstate scale, attracting the world scientific potential to solve its strategic development tasks, searching for new breakthrough energy sources and nonstandard technological solutions, developing the energy-saving culture among energy producers and consumers. This would allow to increase the various energy types production, reduce losses, work steadily, move to such a work with fair competition conditions in the free energy services market. The research purpose is to present a systemic, global vision of ways (a) to create a new model for the sustainable energy development, which would be based on a qualitative change in the energy potential; (b) to ensure sustainable development of territories, energy security, and energy digitalization; (c) to change the structure of energy sources; (d) to preserve the indigenous human environment and industry intellectual potential; (e) to ensure the competent use of alternative and small power energetics; (f) to form the technological and organizational base of innovative energy. The article materials can be practically used by power engineers and economists, politicians, state and municipal authorities, educational institutions, and all those interested in the issues of innovative energy development.

AB The article examines the features of the life and work of the Caucasian mountaineers in the Russian service during the Caucasian War (1801-1864). At the same time, the article examines the service trajectories of not only major historical figures, but also the fate of lesser-known figures. It is through their example that one can see the functional roles fixed by the empire, the presence / absence of mental boundaries, the perception of the imperial service by local communities. The aim of the study is a historical and anthropological analysis of the service of highlanders in Russian military-political institutions based on sources of personal origin and record keeping materials. The study suggested that for the highlanders in the Russian service, the priority was the motive for raising their own status within the local community, rather than advancing the general imperial ladder of ranks and status. Highlanders often hoped with the help of the empire to raise their own political and / or moral prestige among their compatriots. If the service of the empire did not lead to an increase in the "communal" status or, on the contrary, undermined and burdened the reputation of the highlander, then he began to doubt the correctness of his choice. This approach allows us to describe and explain the frequent cases of a change in political identity, "unexpected" betrayals and escapes of highlanders from Russian service, which filled the history of the Caucasian War.

DT Article
DE moral transgression; social media; network discussions; critical
   discourse analysis
AB This article examines how users of virtual network communities react to violations of existing norms and values, what meanings they attach to immoral acts and how they assume the functions of public control. The empirical base of the study was user comments on a particular case of the burning of the Russian flag in Saransk, presented in one of the city's public media. In total, we analyzed 955 messages, there have been four waves of online discussions. The results suggest that the burning of the Russian flag for most users is a traumatic event, a threat to public ideals of good. Network discussions have become a center of attraction for those who want to feel the evil on themselves, triggering a schismogenetic chain of events. Gradually the attackers and victim were reversed, as the first actively used cyber-bullying. In justification, political and ideological meanings were utilized, which, obviously, were not originally intended. Attempts to misuse collective historical memory are recorded, which also affected the discussion. It is concluded that urban network communities are already an embodiment of monitor democracy. This democracy brings us closer to the ideals of civil society, but is requiring external regulation due to lack of discussion culture in conflict situations and generation of new meanings of constructing destructive fake news.

AB The relevance of the article is based on the fact that the issue of Indian-American relations' influence on the dynamics and prospects of interaction within the structure "Russia-India-China" (RIC), which has become a prominent factor in world politics in recent years, attracts attention of political scientists almost from the very beginning of the formation of the trilateral format. Moreover, the starting point and factor of this attention is clearly the policy and stance of the United States towards the RIC.
   The article analyzes the impact of the character an growing dynamics of India-US relations on the interaction development within the "Russia-India-China" (RIC) dialogue format. The question which is pushed forward: is the close rapprochement between New-Delhi and Washington able to destroy the interaction of the "Big Eurasian three"? To react, the author explores the current stage of Indian-American relations, including mutual interests of the parties, and the key directions of their interaction, which were reconfirmed during the visit of the US President to India in February, 2020. The focus is made on the geopolitical goals of the United States, on the global-regional and defense tasks of both countries in the East Asia-Indian Ocean region, where India and the US are both concerned about the rise of China. The author specially focuses on the multi-vector international policy of India, which highly seems to be guided exclusively by the country's own pragmatic interests, and the dialogue with the US is not an exception. It is concluded, that at the current stage the relations between Washington and New-Delhi, being a permanent challenge to the RIC format, are hardly capable to stop the further development of the Russia, India and China dialogue.
   Moreover, the author emphasizes that the RIC prospects are largely a question of adequate perception of the very essence of the trilateral format. Playing a significant role in the consolidation of Russia, India and China - three influential powers that declare the unacceptability of unipolar world, cooperation within the RIC can make an important contribution to the promotion of the democratic world order as well as the pacification of the situation in "hot spots". Therefore, even discrete successes in this important area deserve encouragement and support.

AB The focus of this article is a symbolic image often found in world mythology - a giant snake or a dragon biting its own tail. This image is usually denoted by the Greek word "ouroboros" ((sic)), which means literally "eating its own tail." This essay is devoted to an interpretation of this symbol, which the author sees as leading to the much broader topic of human unfreedom and the forms that this unfreedom takes. The first section deals with the unique features of Gnosticism which have made it appealing in extremely varied times and situations. The author's reflections start from understanding the Gnostic worldview as an expression of apprehensiveness about the radical otherworldliness of the human spirit and its alienation from the universe. The second section deals with the symbolism of the ouroboros and its place in Gnostic conceptual schemes as a reference to the closed cycle of nature that enslaves the human spirit. The third section attempts to decipher layer by layer the Gnostic conceptions associated with the ouroboros. Various levels of interpretation are identified: literal, mythological-magical, psychological-ascetic and socio-political. In the fourth section, the author connects Gnostic ideas with Christianity by interpreting St. Paul's Epistles, particularly his ideas concerning rulers and authorities. The place occupied by the ouroboros in the Christian universe is analyzed. The last section relies on the ideas of Rene Girard, Jacques Lacan and Alain Badiou to illustrate the manifestations of the ouroboros in different dimensions of human existence, both individual and collective, with special emphasis on human desire and its futile circlings.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE Greys; Romain Rolland; history of translations; the philosophy of the
   word
AB Medievalist Ivan Mikhailovich Grevs (1860-1941) in addition to teaching medieval history in higher and secondary educational institutions of St. Petersburg-Petrograd-Leningrad and a significant contribution to theoretical and practical excursion studies and historical local history, perfectly mastered classical, new European languages and was engaged in translations. In historiography, dedicated to the person and the activities of the scientist (works of E. Ch. Skrzhinskaya, V. P. Buzeskul, M. E. Sergeenko, M. A. Alpatov, V. I. Rutenburg, E. D. Frolov, S. N. Valk, B. S. Kaganovich, O. B. Vrasskaya, F. F. Perchenko, A. V. Kreutzer, A. I. Dobkin, K. V. Gersh, A. V. Sveshnikov and others), there are practically no studies analyzing his translated works.This article is intended to contribute to the history of the study of the biography of I. M. Grevs important changes. It was created on the basis of the publication of the unfinished manuscript of the professor and the commentary of the author of 2017 (I. M. Grevs. The Personality and Case of Romain Rolland. Experience in the interpretation of the soul), timed to the 100th anniversary of its writing.Ivan Mikhailovich received his first translation literary experience in the Circle of Literary Evenings in the gymnasium period (1872-1879). His attentive mentor was a teacher of literature and subsequently a friend of Grevs, V. P. Ostrogorsky. The circle was visited by members of the Oldenburg Circle (brothers F. F. and S. F. Oldenburg, D. I. Shakhovskoy, A. A. Kornilov, L. A. Obolyaninov, N. G. Ushinskiy, A. N. Krasnov, N .V. Kharlamov and V. I. Vernadskiy - who later called themselves members of the university, Priyutinsky fraternity). I. M. Grevs translated the play The Venetian Merchant; it was published and became his first print work. (Grevs I. M. The Merchant of Venice (by Shakespeare) // Child Reading / edited by V. P. Ostrogorsky. T. XXV. 1880. P. 1-39). The gymnasium has grown into a professional occupation. Evidence of this are the translations of works by Romain Rolland, still unknown to the Russian public. For the Gorky publishing house, Grevs made several more literary translations of works by foreign authors, but they also did not see the light: Goethe's political drama Rebellious, Abelard's "History of my calamities".I. M. Greys was an unsurpassed author of biographies, which made a significant contribution to the development of the science of "biographies". He was always attracted by large individuals, geniuses (Tacitus, Augustine, Francis of Assisi, Dante, Rolland, and others), he called such - "exemplary carriers", "spiritually meaningful figures", "seekers of truth" and "creative engines" of culture. Moreover, the interest of the historian was caused by those personalities, which reflected the contradictory nature of transitional periods.Turning to the image and texts of the great French writer Romain Rolland (1866-1944), he wanted to enrich the Slavic culture with the "Latin genius". The structure of the historian's manuscript resembles a study that allows its author to improvise in many respects on the theme of R. Rolland's literary work in combination with his biography. This form of presentation of the material shows what Rolland is "good and great", and the historian reveals himself as a deep explorer of culture. Opening the "world of Rolland", Greys did not argue with him and did not engage in criticism, he followed closely with the "word of Rolland", giving an assessment of the work and instrument of the great Frenchman.

AB The evolution of bilateral relations between the PRC and the Republic of Turkey is examined in the context of the integration of the Turkish project "Central Corridor" into the Chinese initiative "One Belt, One Way" in 2013-2019. A set of factors was identified and analyzed that contributed to building a constructive dialogue between Beijing and Ankara on cooperation in the New Silk Road projects. The periodization of the political and diplomatic history of coordination of the Chinese and Turkish concepts of creating a single economic space in Eurasia is proposed; the characteristic of its main stages is presented, as well as the legal and institutional framework for the interaction of the two states formed during the negotiations. A review of the joint projects implemented by Turkey and China in the framework of the land and sea Silk Road projects has been completed. It is noted that their quantitative and qualitative parameters confirm the strategic nature of relations between China and Turkey. It is substantiated that the process of matching the integration models proposed by Beijing and Ankara for Eurasia is far from complete due to the presence of certain disagreements regarding the conditions and limits of bilateral cooperation, as well as due to the influence of adverse foreign policy factors.

   Orthodox Church; Provisional government
AB The events of February 1917, presented on the pages of the church periodicals of Western Siberia, is examined in the article. The relevance of the study is due to the fact that for the first time in Russian historiography the political upheavals of this period have been analyzed on the basis of materials from regional diocesan records. The authors note that the diocesan records are an important historical source. A detailed analysis of the content of articles of Omsk, Tobolsk, Tomsk periodicals ("Diocesan Gazette") on the presentation of the political events of February 1917 in them is carried out. The novelty of the research lies in identifying the attitude of the regional clergy to the revolutionary events in the period from February to April 1917. The presented results of the comparative analysis can be grouped according to the chronology and significance of the events that took place. The article concludes that it was during this period that one could hear the opinion of the Russian Orthodox Church on political changes in the country. It is noted that of particular interest were the issues of the relationship between the Church and the Provisional Government, this topic remained the most acute after the fall of the monarchy. It is shown that the representatives of the Russian Orthodox Church wanted to restore historical justice and receive autonomous government and independence from the secular authorities.

DT Article
DE Archival source; political crisis; privatization; denationalization;
   regional political elite; Soviets of People's Deputies; Primorsky Krai
AB The article is devoted to analysis of heuristic capabilities of the archival documents from the fonds of the State Archive of the Primorsky Krai, which reflect the initial period of the privatization in the Primorye. It studies the formation of regulatory framework for denationalization and privatization in the light of regional specifics, as well as the opinions and expectations of the regional political elite members concerning problems and prospects of practical implementation of the first privatization programs. The research has been carried out mainly on the basis of records management materials of the Soviet of People's Deputies of the Primorsky Krai and that of the city of Vladivostok. The basis of the article is sessions minutes of the Soviets of city and regional levels. The authors take into account the source's limitations and supplement it with information extracted from other types of sources, both published and unpublished. Identified archival documents are analyzed using a synergistic approach and elements of hermeneutics. The authors also use a situational approach and elements of content analysis of the minutes' texts. The views of the Primorye political elite on the privatization course set by the Russian government during the post-Soviet transit were influenced by various factors and events, some of which occurred in the power structures of the federal center. Most local politicians embraced the beginning privatization quite enthusiastically. They were influenced by the myth of possibly fair and equitable privatization, as well as by their own interests and ideological convictions. The analysis focuses considerable attention on the role of individual in the history of privatization in the region, exemplified by V. S. Kuznetsov, the first post-Soviet governor of the Primorye, and by deputies of the local Soviets. The authors conclude that the minutes had not just information function, but provided a tool for self-organization of the local political elite in the context of political crisis.

AB The author analyzes the points of view of Russian authors on the history of privatization in Russia, and they are compared with the opinion of foreign researchers. Herewith, the understanding of politicians-contemporaries of the "privatization era" is compared with scientific opinion. The attitude towards privatization of the two political leaders M. Gorbachev and B. Yeltsin is shown. Criteria of inclusion of works to the historiographical review are defined - it is presence in them judgments on a questions: whether reforms of the first half of 1990s were direct logical continuation of Perestroika? or did Yeltsin's team, which came to power, change the strategy of domestic policy including privatization in the spirit of revolutionary traditions? The author characterizes the conditions under which there was a process of understanding reforms in Russia, and concludes: there are many similarities between the domestic neoliberal assessment of privatization and the opinions of foreign researchers, but there are also differences. The value of the comparative method in the foreign literature on privatization is revealed as well the conceptions "of inevitability of privatization" and "of destruction of the socialist system", common in Russian historiography, are compared. The novelty of the problem statement lies in the fact that the research experience of Russian and foreign authors is presented both at the conceptual level and in line with the Far Eastern regionalism. The main aspects of the privatization study on the Far East materials are revealed.

AB The article is devoted to the analysis of the main directions of China's policy in South-East Asia, as well as the assessment of the most significant vectors of China's foreign policy in the near future.
   The article acknowledges, that modern China not only occupies leading positions in the region, but also makes considerable efforts to deepen and expand the dependence of the ASEAN States on cooperation with China in the economic sphere. To this end, Beijing is launching one of the world's largest economic projects - the Maritime Silk road of the XXI century, in which the majority of Southeast Asian States are expected to participate.
   As a result of the analysis, the author comes to the conclusion that at present the most serious foreign policy threat to the PRC is represented by the proclamation by the new US administration of a course of hard competition with China in the international arena. Washington explicitly reminds Beijing of the possible blocking of the implementation of China's geopolitical interests both in the Southwest (Indian ocean) and in the Southeast (South China and East China seas).
   The article also notes, that cooperation between China and the Southeast Asian States in the political sphere is built on a solid foundation - on the similarity of views on ways to solve the most important global and regional problems. The ASEAN States, together with the PRC, stand for a multipolar structure of international relations, equality and mutual respect between countries, respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity and for non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States. The article emphasizes, that already in the early 2000s China's relations with most of the ASEAN member countries have reached the level of a strategic or comprehensive partnership.
   However, the author draws attention to the fact, that now Southeast Asian countries increasingly express serious concerns about rising of Chinese nationalism, frequent manifestations of China's imperial ambitions in its relations with small States, as well as by the growing military power of China.

AB The article gives an overview of the interaction of the USSR and China during China's anti-Japanese war (1931-1945), which began in the Northeast of China and turned into a long-term occupation of a vast part of the country. From the very beginning, the Soviet Union supported the patriots of the Northeast, hosted partisan groups and individual citizens. The International 88th Separate Rifle Brigade was created near Khabarovsk in order to strengthen Chinese troops. Chinese and Soviet soldiers did military service together. This wartime fraternity played an important role in the Manchu offensive operation and creation of the Manchu revolutionary base, which became the strong point for the complete liberation of the Northeast and afterwards - the foundation of New China. Bilateral interaction during the war years turned into cooperation in China's national economic recovery.
   The author stresses that after the outbreak of the wide-scale war in 1937, the Soviet Union was the only country that provided real military and technical assistance to the Chinese government, sent military advisers and specialists, organized training for Chinese serviceman, granted total USD 250 million loans, and supported China on the international arena.
   The article emphasizes that people has been real actor of all historical events. Both Russia and China keep alive the memory of war heroes. The memory is supported on the state level and in the mass consciousness. This is manifested in taking care of veterans, awarding them with insignia, holding memorable Russian-Chinese joint events, meetings of descendants of war veterans, spreading the truth about wartime events. The article notes the importance of preserving historical memory, opposing attempts to distort facts and revise history for the sake of momentary political interests.

AB The article provides a comparative analysis of the ideological complexes of Russian Narodnichestvo and American Populism. The novelty of the study lies in the first experience of such comparative analysis in domestic historical science. As a key problem, the interpretation of the concept of "people" by Narondiks and populists as a combination of the labor population is considered. The different social composition of the movements and the historical conditions of emergence affected the aims and methods of political struggle of Russian Narodniks and American populists. The political platforms of Russian Narodnichestvo and American Populism reveal both conservative ideological elements and attitudes to protect some socioeconomic conditions, as well as the demands for radical political and social changes. Russian Narodnichestvo is considered as a kind of socialist doctrine ("Russian socialism") about the ideal of social solidarity with elements of a democratic system. American Populism was essentially an updated ideology of "agrarian democracy" with some socialist evasions. The solution to the problem of individual freedom, common to Russian Narodnichestvo and American Populism, was determined by the socio-economic historical conditions of the development of Russia and the United States, as well as the traditions of political thinking. It was concluded that Russian Narodnichestvo and American Populism have many ideological points of contact.

AB Research objectives: This article investigates the alignment of forces in political elite of the Crimean Khanate in 1613-1616.
   Research materials: A wide range of published and archived sources - books and ambassadorial documents of the Russian state.
   Results and novelty of the research: The author discusses the little-studied period of diplomatic relations between the Russian state and the Crimean Khanate in 1613-1616, after the accession of Mikhail Fedorovich Romanov: the stay of the embassy of A. Lodyzhensky and P. Danilov in Crimea from autumn 1613 to July 1614, the preparations and implementation of an embassy congress and exchange near Livny in August 1614, the stay of the embassy of Prince G.K. Volkonsky and P. Ovdokimov in the Crimea from August 1614 to June 1615, the preparation and implementation of the embassy exchange near Valuyki in July 1615, and the stay of the embassy of I. Speshnev and B. Nesterov in Crimea from July 1615 to May 1616. The author shows the central role of the political elite of the Crimean Khanate, meaning the most influential people in the government of Janibek Giray Khan, in establishing peaceful relations between the Russian state and the Crimean Khanate in the framework of their parallel military-political confrontation with the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The article also discusses the role of individual clans of the Crimean nobility in the implementation of diplomatic relations between the two states.

Special attention is payed to the research into historical context of fascism, its mental prerequisites that determined reactionary specifics of its ideological orientation. Noticing that today modern politics experiences far-right and neo-fascist trends, while there are no certain criteria to identify particular parties as neo-fascist ones, the authors suppose that one of the most significant criteria is the adherence to the ideology of standard fascism, which can be detected according to a set of key components.

However, other works, such as "The legend of Slovene and Ruse and the city of Slovensk", "Synopsis, or a Brief Description of the Beginning of the Russian People", which examined the relationship between Russia and the Slays were created in the XVII c. These works were devoted to the questions of unity and disunity of the Slavic world, the development of the idea of Slavic reciprocity, the place of Russia and Russians among other Slays. Exactly in these sources appeared opposition - National or All-Slavic. The study of these sources is able to show a complex background of the evolution of the Slavic idea, to show its roots and analyze factors that determines its further development.

AB At the end of the active phase of the "cultural revolution" in 1969, the public administration system was an eclectic mix of party-state institutions. The State Council, solving the tasks of state administration, could only partially regulate the activities of provincial and grassroots revolutionary committees. Towards the end of the 1970s, forces oriented towards socialist modernization won the battle in the acute domestic political struggle. An integral part of modernization was the restoration and development of the public administration system.
   At the same time, three groups of tasks were solved: 1) the creation of political prerequisites for the restoration of a competent structure of state administration bodies; 2) the participation of the State Council in developing a strategy for the restoration of the country and its development on the path to reform; 3) the formation and implementation of an effective model of public administration.
   The solution of these problems transformed the public administration system in the spirit of a "romantic experiment" based on the denial of the practices and institutions of totalitarian government in the country, the intention to use the experience of advanced states with a market economy and a democratic political system to solve the problem. The ruling elite of the PRC, having familiarized themselves with the model of transformations proposed by the reformers, did not risk their implementation. However, the decade of reform has armed the public administration system with a number of innovations that have played a positive role in China's reform policy and external openness.

SO VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA ISTORIYA-TOMSK STATE
   UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HISTORY
LA Russian
DT Article
DE ethnic images; local groups; Saami; Komi-Izhemtsy
AB The article is dedicated to the ethnic images of Saami and Komi-Izhemtsy of Lovozero, Murmansk region. We believe that images were shaped by the notions about indigenous people and newcomers as well as those notions were determined by the ethnic images. Our goal was to analyze factors that had affected the ethnic images, to analyze factors that impact on the sustainability and transformation of these images. In this article we used publications of the beginning of the 20th century which contain information about Saami - Komi relationships. We also used field data collected in Lovozero during the expeditions in 2011, 2016, characterizing contemporary situation. The research is based on qualitative methodology: interviews with ethnic activists, staff from education and culture, semi-structured interviews with the students of college. Till the end of 19th century Lovozero was typical Saami village (pogost). In the middle of 1890th first houses of the Izhemtsy were built here. Izhma Komi moved to the Kola Peninsula with their reindeer herds in 1887 from Pechora region because of heavy diseases that caused massive loss of deer. Formation of the images of indigenous (Saami) and newcomers (Izhemtsy) had resulted from some objective differences in culture of these ethnic groups (traditional buildings, traditional clothes, economy). These differences were more pronounced in the beginning of the 20th century. We argue that the conflict between indigenous and newcomers, resulting from competition for recourses, is still a pivotal motive in oral narratives about relationships between Saami and Izhemtsy. Forming of the ethnic images was particularly affected by the fact that these groups had competed in the same cultural space (reindeer herding), as well as that Saami become economically dependent on migrants. The reindeer herding, as an important element of the traditional economic activities of Saami and Izhemtsy, had a decisive influence on the ethnic images of these ethnic groups. Nowadays the ideas about "progressive" nature of the Izhma methods of reindeer herding and "backwardness" of the Saami ones have undergone considerable revision under the influence of social, economic and political factors (economic changes of the post-soviet period, support for "traditional Sami ethnic methods of reindeer herding" by foreign organizations). We also note that today published texts on history and ethnography have a certain impact on formation of ethnic images.

AB The article deals with the problem of means of expressing manipulation and creating a certain vision of modern Russia by the Ibero-American mass media. The readers often get subjected to analytical pressure and sometimes the interpretation of events becomes more important than the event itself. Speech influence on consciousness works at the levels of a sentence and a text. The structure and composition of mass-media discourse has the potential of various methods of complex influence on consciousness. Manipulation, being one of the main tools of political communication, is expressed through the means found only in political discourse. The analysis of the media in Ibero-America also revealed special difficulties in understanding Russia. The difficulties are connected to the linguistic and cultural description, because even specialists and researchers interested in the history and culture of Russia do not always understand the realities and specifics of life in the country. Many journalists refer to the image of tsarist Russia, that is why allusions to historical facts are natural. The materials for the study are the articles published by the national media of Bolivia over the period from 2018 to 2020 on the website https:// www.prensalatinaescrita.com. The study includes both linguistic methods and methods of related sciences. (C) 2020 Published by European Publisher.

Starting from the form of a classical myth, the authors gradually ascend historically to the political myth and the peculiarities of mythologemes of this order. The study of political mythology in the context of globalization is more relevant than ever in modern post-industrial society. Countries that are in a state of transitional democratic regimes with emerging democratic institutions are extremely dependent on ideology and political mythology, which can both contribute to the strengthening of emerging institutions, and completely destroy them.

AB This article, though dedicated to the anniversary of a prominent Russian sociologist, is non-ceremonial in nature. Author's goal is to understand M.K. Gorshkov's academic path as efforts of a person fusing considerable organizational talent with a high research culture. As a starting point, one may take the idea of the unity of Russian sociology destinies with sociologist's participation in elaborating its specific problems in the context of scholar's idea of sociology for society. As the author of the article asserts, heading a top Russian sociological center with its developed regional infrastructure, the hero of the day implements scientific strategy of monitoring social processes, which requires a systematic analysis of changes taking place in Russian society, the study of new social realities and elevation of sociological knowledge to the rank of social diagnostics. Obviously, contribution of the person to developing Russian sociological thought, increasing its prestige and influence in Russian society does not need excessive praise. The life credo of M.K. Gorshkov is expressed in the fact that thanks to him and his colleagues and associates, Russian sociology has become a part of world sociological community, not following conjuncture and fashion for the new, forming an integral approach to studying Russian society specifics.

AB The article deals with the problems of development of the tourism sector in the Kingdom of Morocco, which is compared with two other attractive countries for foreign tourists in North Africa - Egypt and Tunisia. The research is based on the analysis of national and international travel statistics, the results of research on the tourism sector in the Arab countries, and field observations of the authors collected during a scientific trip to Morocco in January - February 2020. The reasons for the failure of the long-term strategy (until 2020) for the development of the tourism sector in Morocco are shown. Among them are political problems (especially the consequences of the Arab spring), economic failures of the Moroccan authorities and companies working in the tourism business, as well as a new negative factor for the hospitality industry - the coronavirus pandemic. However, Morocco is still on the 3rd place in Africa in terms of international receipts from tourism. The country is the leader of the continent by the number of international tourists. Authors also study obstacles to turning cultural and historical centers and resorts in Morocco into an attractive destination for Russian tourists, as Egypt and Tunisia managed to be before the events of the Arab spring.

AB This text is an analytical review of the International academic and practical conference "Feats of Arms and Charity by Representatives of the Romanov Imperial Family", (Perm, August 20, 2020) devoted to the history of the Romanov imperial dynasty, its members' service to Russia and charity activities. The Conference was organized by the Institute of World History (Russian Academy of Sciences) in collaboration with the Government of the Perm Region, the "Elizaveta and Sergei Educational Society" Foundation and the Perm State Archive on Socio-political history. The relevance of the event is based on the need to study and preserve traditional values inherent to Russia's history. The presentations were devoted to the Imperial Family members' participation in World War I: the military service of Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich, the activities of Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich as the commander of the Caucasus Native Cavalry Division, the compassionate service of August female representatives of the Romanov dynasty as sisters of mercy, the establishment of charitable institutions in the city of Perm under the Romanov family patronage, and other related topics. A special part of the conference dealt with the history of the "White Flower" charity action, the topic of Christian flower symbols in the charity campaigns patronized by the Romanov Imperial Family, the history of the Goodness and Mercy Festival in Perm, and the renaissance of "White Flower" in Russia. The conference opened the series of academic, public and charity events entitled "The Romanovs' Days in Perm".

ID REAL HUMANISM; IMMORTALITY; DEATH; LIFE
AB The article observes the late period of the oeuvre of L. Leonov, the writer-thinker, in the historic and philosophical context of the Soviet academic philosophy (based on publications of "Voprosy Filosofii" journal). This period is located within approximate chronological frames on the threshold of 1970-1980s. The author comprehends the articles having the following subject: an examination of a person as a complex problem in the context of contemporary global problems (so-called "philosophy of global problems" after I. Frolov). The natural scientific grounds of the Soviet philosophical think are emphasized. It is shown that academic philosophy during the above-mentioned period was characterized by scientific optimism regarding human perspectives, scientific convergence, and building of so-called "new (real) humanism". The transition from the context of academic philosophy to Leonov's oeuvre was realized in this work via the expansion of historic and cultural context due to the representation of several events of the literary process in 1970-1980s. Human consideration in the coordinates of his way of life and history, not in the context of global problems, was typical for this literary process. The second part of the article is devoted to the analysis of Leonid Leonov's literary works and his social and political essays in 1970-1980s. It can be concluded that Leonid Leonov dared to display in his oeuvre in the Soviet conditions possibilities of religious and philosophical as well as theological (even in its heretic mode) comprehension of the total human history and the "human project" itself.

TI Possible Scenarios for Solving the Korean Peninsula Nuclear Problem
SO KOREYSKIY POLUOSTROV: ISTORIYA I SOVREMENNOST'

DT Article; Book Chapter
DE DPRK; USA; denuclearization; missile and nuclear program; diplomacy
AB Considering the lack of progress in the US-DPRK dialogue the international community was debating what would happen after January 1, 2020 as tensions mounted. We see a number of possible scenarios. The first is a negative one. Speaking about the plans for the immediate future, Kim Jong-un in the December 2019 said: "The DPRK has found no grounds to be unilaterally bound any longer by the commitments that the other party does not honor," promising that "the world will witness a new strategic weapon to be obtained by the DPRK in the near future." So, a number of experts and politicians felt confident that the world was on the verge of a new breakthrough in the development of North Korea's nuclear and missile potential, and therefore, a new military and political crisis on the Korean Peninsula was around the corner.
   The second scenario is positive. There is no doubt that maintaining the current environment of relative peace and calm on the peninsula in the near future will serve the interests of both the United States and the DPRK. It is possible that Pyongyang still hopes that once re-elected, Donald Trump will make practical steps to normalize bilateral relations. The fact that Kim Jong-un refrained from drawing any new red lines regarding Washington in his key speech in last December, unlike the preceding decision in April 2019, also supports this idea.

AB The article draws on archival sources on the activities of regional authorities in regulation of economic relations under wartime conditions to discuss problems in organizing production activities of sugar enterprises of the Kursk region. Although there are some works on the history of the industrial production development during the Great Patriotic War on the all-Union, republican, and regional levels, which take into account all modern achievements of historical science and development of the source base, the impact of the war on the state of individual branches of food industry supplying the front and the rear remains unexplored. The choice of the territorial frameworks of the study springs from several circumstances. Firstly, the Kursk region for a long time occupied a leading position in the RSFSR in the volume of products manufactured by sugar factories. Secondly, during the war, the territory of the region had the status of front-line, occupied, front-line, and rear-line area, which had a significant impact on the specifics of all tasks related to production organization. The main source is archival documents on various aspects of management and production activities. The authors have identified documentary materials in the fonds of the Russian State Archives of Economics, the State Archives of the Kursk Region, and the State Archive of the Socio-Political History of the Kursk Region, that cover events and processes associated with the dynamics in the sugar industry of the Kursk region, one of the key sectors of regional wartime economy. They have analyzed the content of these documents and offered a general assessment of problems in functioning of the industry under extreme conditions. Of greatest information value on the said topic are materials from regional archives. Archival documents objectively reflect the situation in the food industry during the war. Their introduction into scientific use will contribute to a reliable reflection of the role of economic potential of the USSR in the defeat of Nazism.

DT Article
DE Russian Medieval City; Pskov; Urban Commune; West and East Middle Ages;
   Medieval City Assembly; Veche; Horizontal Ties within a Medieval Society
AB The article focuses on the collective political institution, the veche, of the Russian medieval city of Pskov. The author argues that the horizontal political ties within that city prevailed over the vertical ones in the period before its subjugation to the Muscovite State in 1510. Pskov is put into a broad comparative perspective which results in the conclusion by the author that the development of Pskov in the fourteenth-fifteenth centuries very closely resembled that kind of urban synoecism which was practiced by Western European communes in their early stage of development (eleventh-twelfth centuries). It means, first, that the Russian Middle Ages repeated in some important features that which had occurred in Western Europe, and, second, that it happened not due to a borrowing of political institutions (as was the case with many East European countries) but independently because of similar conditions arising, albeit after a two-century delay.

DE Nikolay Ustryalov; National Bolshevism; Russian Revolution; history of
   intellectual pursuit in Russia in the 20th century; Russian emigration
AB Introduction. The article examines the theoretical views on revolution as a socio-political phenomenon advanced by N.V. Ustryalov (1890-1937), main ideologist of National Bolshevism. Methods and materials. The article focuses mainly on the publicistic works by N.V. Ustryalov. The task of identifying general theoretical constructs dissolved in the general journalistic discourse or veiled for tactical reasons requires the correct interpretation of images and symbols, careful analysis of all the content, as well as the "reverse" formatting of it in a consistent concept. Analysis. Ustryalov differentiated revolution from other similar social phenomena (coup detat, riot, rebellion, etc.). In his point of view, revolution has several unique features: it follows sine and passes its peak in the middle, it "deepens" at its peak to a "clear idea", which is not implemented, and it is characterized by "heterogeneous goals". There is a good reason to assume that Ustryalov considered the stages of the French Revolution as an invariant for a revolution as such. In the article, the stages of the Russian Revolution in Ustryalovs assessing are analyzed: its general coincidences with the French revolution, the difference in their secondary factors and scenarios. Results. The author suggests that Ustryalov based on his analysis of the Russian Revolution and the general development of Russia in the 1900s-1920s of the 20t h c. was able to formulate a version of Russian history of modern times that is relevant and actual at the moment, because it explains consistent dialectical continuity from the Russian Empire to the USSR, and is the least traumatic for the historical memory of the majority of the population of Russia at the present stage.
