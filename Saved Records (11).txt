AB The current study examines the contribution of left-right (or liberal-conservative) ideology to voting, as well as the extent to which basic values account for ideological orientation. Analyses were conducted in 16 countries from five continents (Europe, North America, South America, Asia, and Oceania), most of which have been neglected by previous studies. Results showed that left-right (or liberal-conservative) ideology predicted voting in all countries except Ukraine. Basic values exerted a considerable effect in predicting ideology in most countries, especially in established democracies such as Australia, Finland, Italy, United Kingdom, and Germany. Pattern of relations with the whole set of 10 values revealed that the critical trade-off underlying ideology is between values concerned with tolerance and protection for the welfare of all people (universalism) versus values concerned with preserving the social order and status quo (security). A noteworthy exception was found in European postcommunist countries, where relations of values with ideology were small (Poland) or near to zero (Ukraine, Slovakia).

AB In the spring of 2014, some anti-Maidan protestors in southeast Ukraine, in alliance with activists from Russia, agitated for the creation of a large separatist entity on Ukrainian territory. These efforts sought to revive a historic region called Novorossiya ("New Russia") on the northern shores of the Black Sea that was created by Russian imperial colonizers. In public remarks, Vladimir Putin cited Novorossiya as a historic and contemporary home of a two-part interest group, ethnic Russian and Russian-speaking Ukrainians, supposedly under threat in Ukraine. Anti-Maidan agitation in Ukraine gave way to outright secession in April 2014, as armed rebel groups established the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhans'k People's Republic on parts of the eponymous Ukrainian oblasts. Rebel leaders aspired to create a renewed Novorossiya that incorporated all of eastern and southern Ukraine from Kharkiv to Odesa oblasts. To examine the level of support for this secessionist imaginary in the targeted oblasts, our large scientific poll in December 2014 revealed the Novorossiya project had minority support, between 20 and 25% of the population. About half of the sample believed that the concept of Novorossiya was a " historical myth" and that its resuscitation and promotion was the result of " Russian political technologies." Analysis of the responses by socio-demographic categories indicated that for ethnic Russians, residents of the oblasts of Kharkiv and Odesa, for older and poorer residents, and especially for those who retain a nostalgic positive opinion about the Soviet Union, the motivations and aims of the Novorossiya project had significant support.

ID STRUCTURAL BALANCE; SOCIAL NETWORKS; ORGANIZATION; DYNAMICS
AB Triadic relationships are accepted to play a key role in the dynamics of social and political networks. Building on insights gleaned from balance theory in social network studies and from Boltzmann-Gibbs statistical physics, we propose a model to quantitatively capture the dynamics of the four types of triadic relationships in a network. Central to our model are the triads' incidence rates and the idea that those can be modeled by assigning a specific triadic energy to each type of triadic relation. We emphasize the role of the degeneracy of the different triads and how it impacts the degree of frustration in the political network. In order to account for a persistent form of disorder in the formation of the triadic relationships, we introduce the systemic variable temperature. In order to learn about the dynamics and motives, we propose a generic Hamiltonian with three terms to model the triadic energies. One term is connected with a three-body interaction that captures balance theory. The other terms take into account the impact of heterogeneity and of negative edges in the triads. The validity of our model is tested on four datasets including the time series of triadic relationships for the standings between two classes of alliances in a massively multiplayer online game (MMOG). We also analyze real-world data for the relationships between the "agents" involved in the Syrian civil war, and in the relations between countries during the Cold War era. We find emerging properties in the triadic relationships in a political network, for example reflecting itself in a persistent hierarchy between the four triadic energies, and in the consistency of the extracted parameters from comparing the model Hamiltonian to the data.

AB Russia is one of the most important players in the Arctic zone energy shelf with significant economic, security, and political interests in the region. This is primarily because of significant natural resources, in particular oil and gas, on the Russian Arctic territories. Arctic has considerable strategic importance to the national economy. The objective of this paper is to develop the concept of sustainable development of the Russian Arctic zone energy shelf within the framework of the Quintuple Innovation Helix Model which focuses on university-industry-government relations, public and civil society, and the natural environment. The paper presents main characteristics of the Russian Arctic and Arctic's oil and gas recourses. We determined the strategic importance of the Russian Arctic as a wealth of petroleum and mineral resources. We offered economic and socioecological approach to the Arctic's sustainable development and paid special attention to the creation of centers of economic growth through the public-private initiatives aimed at knowledge and innovation production and transfer. We estimated social and economic potential of oil and gas shelf projects through the analysis of the possible risks and expectations of main stakeholders. The sustainable development of the Russian Arctic zone energy shelf represents an area of economic, ecological, and social concern, to which the Quintuple Helix innovation model can be applied with greater potential. The Quintuple Helix supports here the formation of a win-win situation between ecology, knowledge, and innovation, creating synergies between economy, society, and democracy, what is the good basis for sustainable development of the Arctic territories and implementation of Arctic Shelf projects.

In particular, why are most countries of post-Soviet Eurasia, according to numerous international evaluations of quality of state governance, similar to underdeveloped Third World countries and lagging behind their post-Communist counterparts in Eastern Europe? This article presents some arguments regarding the factors and mechanisms of emergence and maintenance of bad governance in post-Soviet Eurasia, discusses various explanations for this phenomenon, considers potential pathways for overcoming the trap of bad governance and outlines possible directions for further research of this phenomenon.

AB In this article, we re-analyze the hypothesis that the relationship between the type of political regime and its political instability forms an inverted U shape. Following this logic, consistent democracies and autocracies are more stable regimes, whereas intermediate regimes (anocracies) display the lowest levels of political stability. We re-test this hypothesis using a data set that has not been previously used for this purpose, finding sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis pertaining to the aforementioned U-shaped relationship. Our analysis is specifically focused on the symmetry of this U shape, whereby our findings suggest that the U-shaped relationship between regime types and sociopolitical destabilization is typically characterized by an asymmetry, with consistently authoritarian regimes being generally less stable than consolidated democracies. We also find that the character of this asymmetry can change with time. In particular, our re-analysis suggests that U-shaped relationship experienced significant changes after the end of the Cold War. Before the end of the Cold War (1946-1991), the asymmetry of inverted U-shaped relationship was much less pronouncedthough during this period consistent authoritarian regimes were already less stable than consolidated democracies, this very difference was only marginally significant. In the period that follows the end of the Cold War (1992-2014), this asymmetry underwent a substantial change: Consolidated democracies became significantly more stable, whereas consolidated autocracies became significantly more unstable. As a result, the asymmetry of the U-shaped relationship has become much more pronounced. The article discusses a number of factors that could account for this change.

Using a mixed method approach, the study examined how VSOs in the UK and Russia leveraged the 2012 London and 2014 Sochi Olympics for capacity building. The political framing of the Games as a leverageable resource stimulated VSOs' engagement, but it was more on a tactical than strategic basis. Three main leveraging processes were employed by VSOs including aligning organisational objectives with the Games' strategic visions, using structured Olympic programmes and teaming up with a development partner. VSOs used the Games to enhance their organisational capacity in three areas of staff qualifications, organisational learning and performance management and created public value.

TI Problems of Identificative Matrices Transformation of Modern
   Multicultural Persons in the Variative Discourse of Electronic
   Informative Society Identity
SO PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF SOCIAL SCIENCE AND HUMANITIES
LA English
DT Article
DE Electronic information society; globalisation; identity; multicultural
   identity; the identity matrix
AB The relevance of the proposed research topic is that the 21st century can be called the century of the explosion of identities. National identity is seen as self-determination of individuals and groups in local community coordinates, contrary to the logic of globalisation, with its model of the world citizenship and transnational identity, played and produced in a globalised world that is projected on the sphere of international interpersonal relationships inside the society, affecting, thus, social mega-, macro- and micro levels. Thus, it is necessary to analyse and evaluate national identity in the sociological discourse. Comparison and identification of explanatory, analytical and predictive capacities of research formed the theoretical and methodological approaches to national identity in the context of globalisation processes, which characterised the isolation, distancing from other national and ethnic groups, the search for a national collective "I" and the inclusion of the identity of the resource as a "prize" in the competition for a position in a globalised world. The complexity of the national identification process is caused by the multi-dimensional criteria of identity and its impact upon political, social, cultural and symbolic capital. This research highlights the need to study the implications of information exchange and the negative aspects of the formation of personal identity.

TI The Russian Variant of Food Security
SO PROBLEMS OF POST-COMMUNISM
LA English
DT Article
AB Russia's political leaders have a different understanding of food security than traditional usage. The traditional usage of the term food security refers to access, availability, and nutritional aspects of food. According to the conventional application of food security, the vast majority of the Russian population is not food insecure by traditional measures. The Russian variant of food security connects food trade to national security. The Russian political leadership argues that Russia is food insecure based on food imports. Survey data are used to assess support for the government's food security policy, and to analyze the impact of the self-imposed food embargo on Russian consumers.

AB While urban systems demonstrate high spatial heterogeneity, many urban planning, economic and political decisions heavily rely on a deep understanding of local neighborhood contexts. We show that the structure of 311 Service Requests enables one possible way of building a unique signature of the local urban context, thus being able to serve as a low-cost decision support tool for urban stakeholders. Considering examples of New York City, Boston and Chicago, we demonstrate how 311 Service Requests recorded and categorized by type in each neighborhood can be utilized to generate a meaningful classification of locations across the city, based on distinctive socioeconomic profiles. Moreover, the 311-based classification of urban neighborhoods can present sufficient information to model various socioeconomic features. Finally, we show that these characteristics are capable of predicting future trends in comparative local real estate prices. We demonstrate 311 Service Requests data can be used to monitor and predict socioeconomic performance of urban neighborhoods, allowing urban stakeholders to quantify the impacts of their interventions.

AB Direct democracy is designed to better align policy outcomes with citizen preferences. To test this proposition, we randomized whether 250 villages across Afghanistan selected projects by secret-ballot referenda or by consultation meetings. We find that referenda reduce the influence of local elites over both project type and location. Consistent with previous experimental results, we also find that referenda improve villagers' perceptions of the local economy and of the quality of local governance. However, we find no systematic evidence that selecting projects via referenda increases the average impact of such projects.

   POLICY; CO2; ENERGY; MODEL; ENVIRONMENT; EMISSIONS; ABATEMENT
AB Climate change must deal with two market failures: global warming and learning by doing in renewable energy production. The first-best policy consists of an aggressive renewables subsidy in the near term and a gradually rising and falling carbon tax. Given that global carbon taxes remain elusive, policy makers might have to rely on a second-best subsidy only. With credible commitment the second-best subsidy is higher than the social benefit of learning to cut the transition time and peak warming close to first-best levels at the cost of higher fossil fuel use in the short run (weak Green Paradox). Without commitment the second-best subsidy is set to the social benefit of learning. It generates smaller weak Green Paradox effects, but the transition to the carbon-free takes longer and cumulative carbon emissions are higher. Under first best and second best with pre-commitment peak warming is 2.1-2.3 C, under second best without commitment 3.5 C, and without any policy 5.1 C above pre-industrial levels. Not being able to commit yields a welfare loss of 95% of initial GDP compared to first best. Being able to commit brings this figure down to 7%.

DT Article
DE national identity; state identity; Russian identity; ethnic negativism;
   interethnic attitudes; interethnic consent; interethnic relations;
   tolerance
AB This article discusses how national identity in Russia is understood by the public and among experts who study ethnic issues. The author separates the notion of national identity into categorical identity and associative identity (i.e. the consolidating type of identity which is based on a strong feeling of connection with other citizens). The latter type of identity is present only among a third of people who identify themselves as Russian. The author further analyses the connection of this type of identity with interethnic negativism. She finds that national identity does not remove bias towards abstract 'others'. However, it affects direct interethnic communication in the labour and family spheres. The positive impact of national identity on interethnic attitudes is more apparent in Astrakhan region, which has longer experience of interethnic communication. It is argued that one obstacle to national identity having a positive impact on interethnic attitudes is the lack of a clear and consistent understanding of national identity among education experts, social scientists, and journalists. The study utilizes data from Wave 24 of the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS-HSE) conducted by the Institute of Sociology ("The dynamics of social transformation of modern Russia in the socioeconomic, political, socio-cultural and ethno-religious contexts" Wave 4) and several separate regional polls conducted by the Department of Ethno-sociology of the Institute of Sociology, Russian Academy of Science (IS RAS) between 2014 and 2016.

AB Our empirical tests generally confirm the validity of the Olson-Huntington hypothesis that suggests a bell-shaped relationship between the levels of economic development and sociopolitical instability. According to this hypothesis, lower values of average per capita income tends to lead to increased risks of sociopolitical destabilization (a positive correlation), while a decrease of sociopolitical destabilization risks correlates with higher levels of per capita income (a negative correlation). However, our analysis has shown that this curvilinear relationship can be quite different in some important details for various indices of sociopolitical destabilization, with a very important exception. We show that the relationship between per capita GDP and the intensity of coups and coup attempts is not curvilinear; a particularly strong negative correlation between this index and the logarithm of GDP per capita exists. We demonstrate that this fact makes the bell-shaped relationship considerably less distinct with respect to the integral index of sociopolitical destabilization, and makes a significant contribution to the formation of its asymmetry. Our analysis also shows that the bell-shaped relationship assumed by the OlsonHuntington hypothesis is observed for all other indices of sociopolitical destabilization. In relation to such indices as political strikes, riots, and anti-government demonstrations, we deal with an asymmetry that is directly opposite, since a positive correlation between GDP and instability for poorer countries is much stronger than the negative correlation for richer countries. An especially strong asymmetry of this kind is found for the intensity of anti- government demonstrations.

AB The article is devoted to the problems of a comparative research study of one of the most important practices of politics of memory - commemoration of historical figures and events, i.e., a complex of public acts of "remembering" and (re)interpreting them in the modern context. After reviewing the main approaches to the description and analysis of commemorations, O.Malinova offers a method for studying this process as an instrument of symbolic politics. This method implies a combination of the analysis of political strategies implemented by mnemonic actors and a comparative study of the historical narratives they promote, and an assessment of the potential impact of their actions on the transformation of the social and cultural infrastructure of memory about a commemorated event.

ID DEGRADATION
AB . Earliest studies into the influence of the sea on the economy and settlement structure date back to the mid-19th century. They became common in the 20th century. Researchers have come to a general understanding that a coastal position has a beneficial effect on the development of regions. Such areas have a denser population and develop more rapidly than inland regions. At the same time, the effect of environmental, socioeconomic, demographic, and political factors is often stronger than the influence of the sea. Thus, an inland position can be more beneficial than a coastal one. Both trends are observed in the Baltic Sea macro-region. However, the 'gravitational force' of the sea varies from place to place. This article focuses on the most significant differences between territories and countries. These differences reflect the uneven influence of the proximity of the Baltic Sea on the development of population and national economies. Qualitative differences between meso-regions are measured using a combination of theoretical and empirical typologies. A combined economic, statistical, and cartographic analysis helps to identify a special type of meso-regions - coastal development corridors, which make an important contribution to the economic development and consolidation of the Baltic macro-region. In transnational macro-regions, such typological differences must be taken into account in strategic and spatial planning at the intergovernmental level.

ID NATIONALIZING STATES
AB Two closely related but essentially divergent political projects coexist on the post-Soviet states current political agenda: the formation of a modern civic nation and the consolidation of state institutions and national (nation-state) identity. The search for effective instruments to bridge the deep social and ethno-cultural cleavages their societies confront while promoting these projects brings identity issues to the forefront of political discourse. The article presents the results of a comparative analysis of identity politics strategies and practices pursued by political elites in three post-Soviet republics - Kazakhstan, Armenia and Belarus - cases that demonstrate a diversity of ethnic and cultural composition and of social and economic development resources. The research is based on in-depth interviews taken in research and expert institutions in these countries and is preceded by a critical overview of the concepts of the nation and nation-building in the post-Soviet context. The authors argue that there is a consistent divergence in the trajectories of the state and nation-building projects, and demonstrate that the potential of civic identity is often used to different ends in political and intellectual discourses. The political elites give a clear priority to the state-building agenda, while identity politics promoted by the state focus on the legitimization of the existing political regimes. An assessment of the prospects in post-Soviet societies for nation-building questions the universal appraisal of the "nation state" project in a transforming world order.

ID MARKET POWER; PERFORMANCE; TRANSITION; DETERMINANTS
AB This paper investigates the cost efficiency of Russian banks with regard to their heterogeneity in terms of ownership form, capitalization and asset structure. Using bank-level quarterly data over the period 2005-2013, we perform stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) and compute cost efficiency scores at the bank and bank group levels. We deduct from gross costs the negative revaluations of foreign currency items generated by official exchange rate dynamics rather than by managerial decisions. The results indicate that the core state banks, as distinct from other state-controlled banks, were nearly as efficient as private domestic banks during and after the crisis of 2008-2009. Foreign banks appear to be the least efficient market participants in terms of costs, which might reflect their lower (and decreasing over time) penetration of the Russian banking system. We further document that the group ranking by cost efficiency is not permanent over time and depends on the observed differences in bank capitalization and asset structure. We find that foreign banks gain cost efficiency when they lend more to the economy. Core state banks, conversely, lead in terms of cost efficiency when they lend less to the economy, which can result from political interference in their lending decisions in favor of unprofitable projects Private domestic banks that maintain a lower capitalization significantly outperform foreign banks and do not differ from the core state banks in this respect.

DE epistemology; normativity; science; morality; descriptive;
   objectivization; consciousness
AB The question about epistemic nature of norms is a special case of discussing the non-standard definition of knowledge. Is it possible to expand the understanding of knowledge beyond the propositions expressed by narrative sentence and describing what takes place? Might a moral norm, an aesthetic ideal, a religious symbol be taken as specific types of knowledge? Thesis on the special epistemological status of science, its empirical basis and methods lies in the basis of naturalistic revision of epistemology by Quine. White, on the contrary, considers scientific observations and moral experiences equal means to justify objective and normative content in science as well as in morality and art. With regard to the contemporary expansion of the subject matter of epistemology White is more advantageous, although both sides ultimately do not extend beyond reduction of all cultural phenomena to the facts of individual consciousness. The resolution of the dispute under consideration can be provided by the turn of epistemological reflection to the study of the cognitive content of cultural objectivizations of human activity and communication, to the analysis of specific forms of representation and functions of whatever cognitive phenomena in the social artifacts. On the one hand, this extends the subject-matter of traditional epistemology by involving all the diversity of consciousness and on the other hand, this prepares methodological insights for cultural and religious studies, ethics, aesthetics, and political science.

AB Only taking into consideration the interplay between processes occurring at different levels of a country can provide the complete social and geopolitical plot of its urban system. We study the interaction of the administrative structure and the geographical connectivity between cities with the help of a multiplex network approach. We found that a spatially-distributed geo-network imposes its own ranking to the hierarchical administrative network, while the latter redistributes the shortest paths between nodes in the geographical layer. Using both real demographic data of population censuses of the Republic of Kazakhstan and theoretical models, we show that in a country-scale urban network and for each specific city, the geographical neighbouring with highly populated areas is more important than its political setting. Furthermore, the structure of political subordination is instead crucial for the wealth of transportation network and communication between populated regions of the country.

AB Philosophers and historians considered society as the expanded family in the middle of the 19th century. The current state of the institution of the family is characterised by various parameters. The electronisation of the modern information society makes it possible for folklore to be easily shared among Internet users. Many of the crisis processes that are observed now in the family are the continuation of tendencies formed in those years when the family was the unique intermediary between the individual and society. Research testifies to this. Social, political and economic change in Russia in the past and at present make the study of the family especially interesting. Folklore available on the Internet, because of its small forms is convenient for sociological analysis. It provides anthropologists, culturologists and sociologists with additional data as other sources provide only fragments of statistics.

AB Once the primary method of revolutionary leadership, the "mass line" has reemerged in today's China as a method of public policy making. This study explores and theorizes the implications of mass-line tactics in policy making and state-society relations in contemporary China. At the theoretical level, it argues that the de-ideologized mass line in combination with traditional forms of nonmobilized participation can enhance government responsiveness to the broader public interest. The mass line can complement traditional forms of voluntary participation in that it can allow better representation of social groups who regularly fail to articulate their needs through the existing participation mechanisms and who therefore remain outside of the policy-making process. Empirically, the paper draws on existing Chinese studies, official document analysis, and unstructured interviews with Chinese academics to provide examples for the theoretical argument. This study analyzes the workings of the mass-line tactics in China during the New Healthcare Reform and the formation of the 12th Five-Year Plan. If implemented not as a propaganda tool but as a mechanism of interest articulation and aggregation, the mass line has the potential to off er China alternative routes of democratization.

AB The article examines the evolution of the main features of the Russian economy in terms of the types of key actors of economic development. The concept of the general actor as the predominant type of relatively independent socio-economic subsystems that determine the impact on the functioning of the national economy is introduced. The movement of the economy from "the state economy" to "the economy of individuals" and further to "the economy of socioeconomic and administrative-political systems" is traced. The preconditions for the transition of the national economy to the phase of the systemic economy as the harmonic economy with high-level coordination of various-scale and various-quality subsystems of the economy and society are noted.

AB The article based on unpublished evidence from the Russian State Archive of Economics examines Nikita Khrushchev's initiative to reform the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) in 1962-1963. This is the first article to reveal cause and effect relationships between domestic reforms in the Soviet Union, "the winds of change" in CMEA and the new ideological paradigm of the Khrushchev era. The latter encompassed the construction of communism by 1980, the expansion of the socialist system in the world, the USSR's victory over the USA in an economic race between the superpowers. The Soviet government considered its reforms in CMEA as a vital step towards the complete merging of the economies of CMEA's member states in a "brave new world" of the communist future. The article provides a detailed analysis of what the Soviet leadership aimed at as it called for the 16th extraordinary session of CMEA in June 1962. Before and during the session the most active support for the USSR's initiatives was rendered by Poland whereas small agricultural states, such as Rumania and Bulgaria, showed staunch resistance to the Soviet innovations as they were specified throughout 1963. It was an attempt to defend their sovereignty and prevent CMEA from turning into a supranational political and economic body in the entire socialist camp. The author comes to the well-grounded conclusion that, unlike in the western integration models, small countries in the socialist camp acted as a drag on the integration process, rather than its driving force. On the other hand, the article shows that the CMEA reforms triggered an acute struggle among the USSR's top party and state bureaucracy. Although "Khrushchev's socialist globalism" was sharply criticized by Leonid Brezhnev and his supporters, which was one of the arguments for his dismissal in October 1964, this idea saw its rebirth during the next wave of CMEA's reforms in the early 1970s.

AB This article reveals Russian paradox: the combination of high level of corruption with strong and relatively effective government. In the focus of attention lies the examination of relations between the corruption and the processes of socio-political transformations of the end of the XX beginning of the XXI centuries and the particularities of the corruption integration into the government of Russia. Basing upon the concept of the corruption as a political and administrative rent the author arrives to the conclusion about the formation of the corrupt model of governance in Russia. The article analyses factors which give relative efficiency to the Russian model of corrupt governance as well as the costs and contradictions of it. The author also reaches the conclusion that corruption-oriented model of governance is prospectless and makes a point that effective anti-corruption measures in Russia can be carried out only in case of current regime change and consequent realization of democratic, market and administrative reforms.

ID ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT; DEMOCRACY; INCOME; TASTE
AB Our study suggests that the relationship between per capita GDP and socio-political destabilization is not negative as tends to be believed; we are rather dealing with an inversed U-shaped relationship: the highest risks of destabilization are typical for countries with neither the lowest nor the highest values of GDP per capita, but rather with intermediate values of this indicator. Thus, up to a certain value of per capita GDP the economic growth tends to lead to an increased risk of sociopolitical destabilization, and only with relatively high values of per capita GDP its further growth tends to lead to a decrease in sociopolitical destabilization risks. Hence, for higher values of per capita GDP we observe a negative correlation between GDP per capita and the risk of social and political instability, and for lower values it is positive. An especially pronounced positive correlation of this sort is found with respect to such an indicator of sociopolitical destabilization, as the intensity of anti-government demonstrations. A very strong (r = 0,935, R-2 = 0,875) statistically significant positive correlation between GDP per capita and the intensity of anti-government demonstrations can be seen in a very wide range (up to 20 000 international 2014 dollars at purchasing power parity [PPP]). Apparently, the positive correlation between, on the one hand, per capita GDP, and, on the other hand, the socio-political destabilization in general, and the intensity of anti-government demonstrations in particular, that we observe in the range of up to 20 000 dollars is one of the factors responsible for the existence of so called middle-income trap. The middle-income trap is usually defined as "the phenomenon of hitherto rapidly growing economies stagnating at middle-income levels and failing to graduate into the ranks of high-income" (according to S. Aiyar et al.). Indeed, as we see, just when an economy approaches the escape from this trap, the destabilization intensity tends to reach very high values, which could trigger particularly strong upheavals that could throw this or that country back for many years.

AB Compliant activism - that is, political activity of the population, either fully supporting the regime, or merely criticizing individual shortcomings of its policies - strengthens authoritarian rule. However, compliant activism can over time turn into non-compliant one. Hence, the regimes need to ensure that the norms of compliant activism are internalized by the society and become self-enforcing. We use the case of the Communist legacies in Russia to show that compliant activism can, indeed, become highly persistent and outlive the regime, where it emerged. Using cross-regional variation in the levels of compliant activism in the contemporary Russia, we demonstrate that it is strongly affected by the variation in the membership share of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the 1970s. The results have broader implications beyond the Russian case and provide relevant insights for studying political activism in autocracies.

AB Keeping climate change within limits requires that most of the available carbon-based energy sources need to be abandoned underground. We study how fast and how much this transition to carbon-free energy needs to occur within a welfare-maximizing Ramsey growth model of climate change. Our model also addresses the market failure in the development of clean energy which leads to an under-provision of renewable energy, delays the transition time to the carbon-free era and reduces the amount of dirty fuels locked up in situ. Optimal policy requires an aggressive renewables subsidy in the near term and a gradually rising carbon tax which falls in long run. We also study the transition timing and the performance of recently proposed policy rules for the carbon tax.

AB The author considers the evolutionary approach to the development of the scientific knowledge in framework of the Niklas Luhmann's system-communicative theory and presents a thesis that in respect to the final evolutional state (state of stabilization of new form of knowledge) the organization of the Russian science has not yet achieved the world-level of sufficient autonomy because there was not yet been established the self-substitutive order of the knowledge accumulation which is inherent to the autopoiesis of the contemporary science i.e. the process of continued change of some ones truths by some others. The factors impeding to establish such a self-substitutive order are to be connected by the author with the impact on the scientific discourse from some external communicative forms (the theological, financial, economical, political ones) and with the continuous change of some selective criterions that have to define what has to be accumulated as a memory of the science as a communicative system.

AB The paper reconstructs the evolution of knowledge and truth in the perspective of the sociology of science with particular attention towards the communicative theory of science developed by Niklas Luhmann. The author of the paper does not confine himself to reproducing some manifest concepts of N. Luhmann but represents some contexts not talked by the later; he draws his own illustrating material, interline the socio-communicative description of the contemporary science in the context of classical discussions in the philosophy and methodology of science. The main subject of interest includes the problems of the truth interpretation as a symbolic medium of scientific communication, the perspectives of the comparative analysis of the truth on a level with the media of some other communicative systems (i.e. the political system, the economy). The author explores the interdisciplinary capabilities that could have been triggered by this system-communicative theory of science. In particular, the processes of inflation/deflation are compared that characterize both the scientific and economical types of communications; the social, topical, and temporal dimensions of truth are considered what enables to reconstruct both internal and external factors in development of the scientific knowledge. Thus, the truth is conceptualized as a communicative reference point subjected to the evolution from some traditional normative expectations (first of all "the prohibition of falsehood" and "the prohibition of oblivion") towards the contemporary media-symbol with a function to mark the knowledge newness and actuality that corresponds to some cognitive expectations i.e. the willingness to deny by certain conditions even some established generalizations and attitudes.

TI Political Economy of Redistribution

DT Article
DE Political economy; legislative bargaining; property rights; institutions
ID DYNAMIC THEORY; POLICY-MAKING; CONSTITUTIONS; MODEL
AB It is often argued that additional constraints on redistribution such as granting veto power to more players in society better protects property from expropriation. We use a model of multilateral bargaining to demonstrate that this intuition may be flawed. Increasing the number of veto players or raising the supermajority requirement for redistribution may reduce protection on the equilibrium path. The reason is the existence of two distinct mechanisms of property protection. One is formal constraints that allow individuals or groups to block any redistribution that is not in their favor. The other occurs in equilibrium where players without such powers protect each other from redistribution. Players without formal veto power anticipate that the expropriation of other similar players will ultimately hurt them and thus combine their influence to prevent redistributions. In a stable allocation, the society exhibits a class structure with class members having equal wealth and strategically protecting each other from redistribution.

The authors examine the principal historical stages of both reforms as the parts of the Russian system of public governance evolution. The configuration of main actors of Russian governance reforms and of government-market relations are presented. The paper focuses on generalising some major characteristics of the administrative mechanisms of governance in Russia as the complex and interlinked entities. Some key elements of Russian governance reforms are described, including organisational aspects of civil service, optimisation of the functions and structure of the executive bodies, implementation of results-based management mechanisms and improvement of the regulatory system, public services delivery, one stop shop procedures, E-government.

We challenge the dominant realist approaches to Russia's neighborhood policy by introducing the concept of biopolitics as its key element, which makes analysis of political relations in the post-Soviet area more nuanced and variegated. More specifically, we address an important distinction between geopolitical control over territories and management of population as two of Russia's strategies in its "near abroad."

TI Pitfalls in the Study of Democratization: Testing the Emancipatory
   Theory of Democracy
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB In this issue, Dahlum and Knutsen (D&K) claim to disprove the emancipatory theory of democracy proposed by Inglehart and Welzel (I&W). 1 This theory posits that rising emphasis on universal freedoms, or what I&W call 'emancipative values', is a major force driving the emergence and survival of democracy.
   To support their claim, D&K impute country scores to emancipative values for years in which real data are absent. 2 These imputations allow them to produce a time-series cross-sectional (TSCS) database, consisting of some 2,000 country-year observations. 3 Running panel regressions over these data, D&K find that a population's emphasis on emancipative values in a given year has no effect on its level of democracy in the next year. D&K believe that this result invalidates I&W's theory, in which case the values of a population are irrelevant for whether it attains and sustains democracy.
   We appreciate this contribution because it provides a welcome opportunity to pinpoint some pitfalls of TSCS frameworks. To do so, we proceed in three steps. First, we describe the problem with TSCS data in conceptual terms; then we illustrate the problem with a simulation; finally we demonstrate what real data say about I&W's theory. We conclude that the evidence supports the emancipatory theory of democracy as powerfully as it did in I&W's original analyses.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE European Union; EU institutional system; EU political system; systemic
   crisis of the EU; flexible integration
AB Today, the European Union is in a systemic crisis. The main challenges are well known: Euro crisis underlined by insufficient competitiveness of the EU economy; migration crisis, which is feeding Euroscepticism and ultra-right radicalism; Brexit referendum that highlighted all the defects of the EU political system, primarily those related to the ideology of integration and identity issues. These external shocks have provoked a systemic crisis because, over the last ten years, the institutional and political system of the EU has considerably degraded. This article attempts to identify key negative trends in the development of this system which took place in the past decade: 1) the erosion of solidarity and the collapse of the "inevitable" integration ideology; 2) an increasing heterogeneity within the EU as a result of enlargement that limited potential of Europeanization; 3) reinforcement of the intergovernmental method of governance to the prejudice of a communitarian one; 4) an increasing gap between the image of the EU as an "omnipotent bureaucracy", the scope of tasks, and modest resources; 5) growing legitimacy deficit and 6) the problem of leadership. On this basis, the paper provides a critical analysis of possible transformation scenarios for the institutional and political system of the European Union, an assessment of their probability, ensuing risks and opportunities. The paper concludes that the most possible option is a further development of various elements of flexible integration, which would transform the EU into a "core and periphery" system. Flexibility would allow combining the federalization of the EU core, and the current (or even lower) level of integration for those countries who do not want or cannot take new obligations.

At the same time, these factors do not fully explain the identified correlation, indicating the need for further research.

ID OCCUPY MOVEMENT
AB It is shown that the Arab Spring acted as a trigger for a global wave of socio-political destabilization, which significantly exceeded the scale of the Arab Spring itself and affected absolutely all world-system zones. Only in 2011 the growth of the global number of large-scale anti-government demonstrations, riots and political strikes was to a high degree (although not entirely) due to their growth in the Arab world. In the ensuing years, the Arab countries rather made a negative contribution to a very noticeable further increase in the global number of large-scale anti-government demonstrations, riots and general strikes (the global intensity of all these three important types of socio-political destabilization continued to grow despite the decline in the Arab world). Thus, for all these three important indicators of sociopolitical destabilization, the scale of the global echo of the Arab Spring has overshadowed the scale of the Arab Spring itself. Only as regards the fourth considered indicator (major terrorist attacks / guerrilla warfare) the scale of the global echo for the entire period considered did not overshadow the scale of the Arab Spring (and, incidentally, "Winter") - and in 2014-2015 Arab countries continued to make a disproportionate contribution to the historically record global values of this sad indicator global number of major terrorist attacks/guerilla warfare. To conclude, triggered by the Arab Spring, the global wave of socio-political destabilization led after 2010 to a very signifi cant growth of socio-political instability in absolutely all World System zones. However, this global destabilization wave manifested itself in different World System zones in different ways and not completely synchronously.

It's argued that some of modes of such interpretation lead researchers to the dangerous relativism. The author emphasizes the removal of the opposition between external and internal history of science, the inclusion "non-humans" to the objectness of the historical thinking, going beyond presentism as the way of describing of the history of science, as well as the approval of variability of the fundamental concepts of scientific activity. The thesis is that, in spite of this, we should conceive science historically, readily meeting all relativistic consequences of this thinking. Also we should understand relativism as the necessary reason of the epistemologist studies. In conclusion, I discuss the importance of this historical thinking about science in the epistemic, disciplinary and socio-political contexts.

TI Economic Growth under Extractive Institutions: the Soviet Paradox and
   Contemporary Events
SO MIR ROSSII-UNIVERSE OF RUSSIA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE inclusive institutions; extractive institutions; Soviet
   industrialization; economic growth; modernization; social lifts
AB This article investigates the economic success of the USSR in terms of the concept of inclusive institutions (CII) developed by Acemoglu and Robinson. It avoids the problem that the original concept is not well suited for offering a systematic explanation of the Soviet paradox, that is, its long and intensive economic growth under conditions of extractive political institutions. The article clarifies and develops some of the problematic aspects of CII to achieve a more precise and consistent explanation of the paradox. In particular, it introduces some missing supplemental concepts, such as social lifts (as the main criterion of inclusive institutions), regimes of catch-up and advanced economic growth; a three-factor economic growth model which includes technological, institutional and cultural factors; the principle of the compatibility between developmental factors; and the principle of dissipating inclusiveness. This more comprehensive conceptual framework allows for a more consistent explanation of the USSR's history from its formation until its eventual collapse. The framework itself is also well suited for explaining the success of other oil producing countries in the Middle East.

TI POPULISM WILL BE LONG LASTING
SO POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE populism; capitalism; rent; Great Transformation; post-democracy;
   government regulation; neoliberalism
AB The article investigates the phenomenon of contemporary populism. The author draws attention to the contradictions accompanying the attempts of its conceptualization. He describes populism as a phenomenon that is completely ineradicable, though marginal and fading when the situation normalizes. At the same time, the description of the modernity in categories of post-policy, a postmodern, post-democracy, post-ideology, etc. leads us to the fact that populism begins to remind a systemically important phenomenon of modern political field. In order to achieve less contradictory conceptualization of the phenomenon of populism, the author proposes to study it in the context of the second and third Great Transformation of capitalism. Many experts claim populism to be the quintessence of consensus regarding the need for state regulation, characteristic for all the major ideologies of an era of the second Great Transformation. It remains considerably the same in the period of the third Great Transformation we are witnessing now. Since current problems cannot be solved "in natural way," there are objective prerequisites for the approach of a new era of social reformation. Traditional left-wing as well as traditional right-wing forces are in crisis, yielding initiative to the regulatory policy of neoliberals. However, the right-and left-wing populists are substituting them. Therefore, during the ongoing Great Transformation, the influence of populism will grow, as it is actually already happening now. People will place high expectations on populism, such as the usual expectations of the regulation and the expectations of social experiments aimed to make social organization of modern societies more appropriate and enrich it. These expectations will be satisfied to the extent that populism would be able to implement the underlying in its nature democratic desire of the "nation" to gain control over their own destiny. Otherwise, both right and left populist political activities will reduce to contest for a rent, characteristic of an era of " cognitive capitalism," when, for example, the very existence of permanent job is already a privilege, providing a rent in the form of wages.

AB In the 1960s Mancur Olson and Samuel Huntington suggested that the positive correlation between per capita income and the level of sociopolitical destabilization that they detected for low and middle income countries might be partly accounted for by the growth of the inequality associated with the economic and technological development in these countries. The empirical tests we perform generally support this hypothesis, but they also identify certain limits for such an explanation. Our tests reveal for low and middle income countries a statistically significant correlation between GDP per capita and the economic inequality levels, but this correlation is not particularly strong. Earlier we found for the same countries significantly stronger positive correlations between GDP per capita and some important components of sociopolitical destabilization, such as the intensity of political assassinations, general strikes and anti-government demonstrations. It is quite clear that the strong association between the increase in the intensity of these components of sociopolitical destabilization and GDP per capita growth, can be explained by a much weaker tendency toward the growth of economic inequality only partly. In addition, our empirical tests suggest the presence of a certain threshold level of about 40 points on the Gini scale, after crossing which one can expect a radical increase in levels of sociopolitical destabilization in general, and the intensity of terrorist acts/guerrilla warfare and anti-government demonstrations in particular. According to the World Bank, the value of the Gini coefficient for Russia is now just in this zone, which suggests that the further growth of inequality in Russia could lead to an abrupt increase in political destabilization.

DT Article
DE future; rental society; precariat; stratification; labour;
   neoliberalism; the welfare state; universal basic income
AB According to the consolidated economic projections, not only in Russia but also on the global horizon of the future there are outlines of a new social structure - the rental society. Global markets show their geographical limits, competition for market outlets intensifies, and a new wave of technological automation and robotics for the first time ever, excludes from the economy more jobs than creates. The precariat and the unemployed are growing in numbers and may potentially become a new majority. Principles of stratification related not so much to possession by the citizens of the capital or labor resources, as to individual access to a predominantly non-economic sources and mechanisms of social rents distribution are radically changing. This is an image of a society without mass labor, economic growth and influential middle class, where the poor social strata are in want of the social state, distributing a guaranteed rent. But at the same time this growing need for the social state cuts its availability. Therefore, in the context of capitalism a growing number of citizens are considered superfluous, and prospects for their welfare are frequently associated with the mechanisms of the increasingly popular concept of a universal basic income, replacing the less affordable welfare state. This causes a growing demand for a strong state and an egalitarian society, which keeps weakening the neoliberal discourse insistence on the advantage of the self-regulating economic markets. It is crucial to prepare for the coming rental future, a different social structure, new economic and political contradictions and possible ways for their mitigation.

   HEART-TO-HEART TALKS WITH VETERANS OF LOCAL CONFLICTS
SO LOGOS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE politics of memory; veterans; local conflicts; testimony; trauma studies
ID AFGHANISTAN
AB This article considers the formation contexts and conceptual content of American trauma studies, and raises a question of the prospects for carrying out similar research in Russia. What is meant here is, primarily, the "war trauma" of combatants. Studying oral testimonies of Russian veterans of the Afghan and Chechen Wars, the authors discuss the difficulties the combatants face when trying to articulate their war experience. However, such "representation failures" can by no means always be described using the medical term "trauma," especially since "medicalization" and "victimization" strategies frequently encounter opposition by the veterans themselves. Therefore, in order to do justice to theoretical and practical trauma studies, the authors suggest a cautious 'reconnaissance' over ready-made models and "strong programmes," the reconnaissance being highly sensitive to both the socio- political context of a testimony and the voice of the witness.
   The metaphor of " trauma" exists in the veterans' narrative in various contexts. Most frequently, it occurs within an existentialist discursive strategy as a marker of a liminal - and often sublime - experience. On the other hand, it can be used when describing the corporal nature of memory, rooted in everyday habits and habitus. However, this metaphor rarely occurs in cultural-ideological or ironic narratives. The stories of the veterans are typically very fragmentary, amounting to a situational interweaving of the aforementioned narrative lines. Reducing this precarious conglomerate to a singular discursive line - and turning it into a policy of representation imposed from above - can hardly be justified. That is why the authors emphasize the importance of a phenomenological description of experience from below, with all its gaps and contradictions, rather than the mechanical use of ready-made theoretical schemes and intellectual cliches.

AB This article examines the structural level developments in the Russian nationalities policy, focusing on the (dis) similarities between the Yeltsin's and Putin's periods. Although Putin's administration made certain interventions in the domain of nationalities policy, this approach cannot be compared with the Soviet time policy: recent developments cannot be interpreted as a new pro-assimilating policy. Finally, the authors examine the structural changes for the rise of latent nationalism using a structural equation modeling approach on a unique data set consisting of political and cultural nationalism indices for 21 Russian republics. These findings show that there is some consistency on the structural level of nationalities policy.

AB The Russian Revolution dramatically changed the history of our country and of the whole world. The search for its causes generated many theories and views. On the one hand, we can hardly perceive it beyond the peculiar socio- historical development of the Russian society and specific historical situation. On the other hand, starting from the Modern Era, many countries were 'taken ill' with revolutions. In the present article the author analyzes the Russian Revolution in connection with the world historical process, defines some common causes of revolutions and shows in what way these causes have manifested in our history, he also reveals the similarity of the Russian Revolution with other significant revolutions as well as distinguishes its peculiarities. This gives an opportunity to answer the questions whether the Russian Revolution was inevitable and whether the drastic social transformations that took place in the first period of the Soviet history were inevitable either. The focus of the present article lies on the correlation between revolution and modernization, on the interconnections, threats and traps that result from an accelerated development of a society and can lead to revolutions. Starting from the Modern era the revolutions are underpinned in most cases by considerable disproportions in the societal development resulting from an accelerated modernization. These disproportions are aggravated by a fast population growth and by an extremely sharp increase of the share of urban population in the structure of society. The article demonstrates how and why the revolutions occur during the periods after some (sometimes long) increase in the living standards of population and growing expectations, as well as why the revolutions are possible just in the societies successful in economic terms as it was with the pre-revolutionary Russia. The conclusion is made that the revolution at a certain stage of modernization is more probably a predicted pattern than a random event. The article reveals the mechanism that brings a society into a peculiar-type trap - the modernization one. While the Malthusian trap is believed to be connected with a lag of productive forces from population growth rates and the generally insufficient transformational dynamics, the modernization trap, on the contrary, is associated with extremely rapid changes which leave behind some most important societal relations and institutions. In Russia there originated a peculiar type of modernization trap - the Malthusian-Marxian one.

AB The paper contributes to the studies of effects of political regimes on public policies by looking at a previously unexplored aspect of this issue: the propensity of political regimes to create vast and extensive formal regulation. To study this topic, it applies subnational comparative method and uses a dataset of subnational regions of Russia, which provides a unique opportunity for a large-N investigation of the research question because of substantial variation of regional political regimes and regulatory environments and because of availability of a proxy for comparing the use of formal regulation across regions. The paper shows that more competitive regimes are more likely to expand the formal law than less competitive ones; however, the implications of this expansion of formal law for the economy are ambiguous.

AB The article analyzes the main substantive components, factors of stability and the potential for erosion of the politico-ideological consensus established in the modern Russia. On the one hand, A. Melville documents the extraordinary strength of this consensus, buttressed by the powerful factors such as the long-term position of power holders, support from the elitist and bureaucratic circles, effective propaganda with a strong mobilizational impact, conservative orientation of the middle class and dominating mass attitudes. On the other hand, the author draws attention to a number of not-so-obvious factors that could turn the tide in the long term, such as volatility of mass sentiments, possible alterations within the elite groups, as well as the internal flaws of the modern neoconservative idea.

TI PETER THE GREAT'S SECOND VOYAGE TO EUROPE IN THE LETTERS OF BARON P. P.

SO QUAESTIO ROSSICA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Peter I; P. P. Shafirov; A. D. Menshikov; Peter the Great's second
   European tour
AB This article examines correspondence between Baron P. P. Shafirov and Prince A. D. Menshikov from the spring of 1716 to the summer of 1717. These letters reveal the details of Peter I's stay in Copenhagen, different German cities, and the Netherlands during his second European voyage. As one of the leaders of the Russian foreign ministry and a close companion of the tsar, Shafirov was at the centre of many of the political and domestic events that occurred during this tour. Like the majority of those surrounding the tsar, the baron unofficially informed A. D. Menshikov of all business requiring attention, since Menshikov was in charge of managing the Russian state during Peter's absence. Published here for the first time, Shafirov's letters come down to us in the form of copies made in Menshikov's chancellery in February 1723: these are kept in fond 198 (A. D. Menshikov) of RGADA (Russian State Archive of Ancient Acts). The information in these letters is multisided. Firstly, one finds important military and political reports. While these historical narratives are rather well-known, Shafirov provides additional interesting details. Secondly, these letters are of interest because they provide news about the movement of Peter I and his wife, Tsarina Yekaterina Alekseevna, around Europe. Of particular note are the baron's reports about the tsar's serious illness in Amsterdam during the winter of 1716-17. The epistles also clarify the dates and routes that the tsar took, allow us to look at the climate in the countries where he stayed, and provide details about transport and communication links. Thirdly, and rather indirectly, the correspondence helps us to reconstruct the nature of the relationship between Shafirov and Menshikov and their families. All of these reasons make Shafirov's letters a valuable historical source. Their significance is fully revealed when analysed alongside analogous documentation connected with Peter the Great's second tour of Europe and the Great Northern War in general.

DE knowledge; society; technoscience; social technology;
   transdisciplinarity; ethics; safety
AB The paper analyses specific features of knowledge development on the contemporary stage of the science evolution. It is revealed that postnonclassical paradigm of scientificity correlates with the stage called "technoscience". It is reasoned that in frames of the existing system of scientific knowledge classification which includes natural, socio-humanitarian and technical sciences, technoscience cannot be referred to any of these types of knowledge. Technoscience represents new concept of knowledge production, new socio-technocratic discourse. Authors give the characteristic of the "technoscience" phenomenon with its' basic feature high socio-practical orientation. The peculiarity of technoscience is that its' objects are not elements of the Cartesian dualistic worldview, but so called "humane-dimension" objects. New stage of integration between science and society is characterized by the methodology of transdisciplinary research. Transdisciplinary research in comparison with interdisciplinary is distinguished by the life practice outcome; it is socially distributed knowledge production. Knowledge is produced not only in the context of breakthrough and fundamental objectivation, but as well in the context of the assessed consequences of application (social assessment of technology). It is highlighted that technoscience is referred to the activity in frames of which science and technology are united (as a mixture or hybrid); technoscience is to be understood as a specific contemporary phenomenon, a social technology of its kind. Philosophic analysis of the contemporary science trends of development allows showing that science is no longer a matter of the armchair scientists, but an action included to social practice. Fundamental research, technoscience and technology assessment convergently interact. As a result, the new is not revealed, but is constructed in the space of interaction between science and society. Since the subject of the technoscience is represented by complex self-developing systems including a human being, scientific activity begins to be regulated by additional compared to traditional science ethical norms. There is a need to carry out additional reflection on scientific knowledge in the form of socio-ethical expertise of models and projects, for example, in order to identify social risks. The paper shows that in technoscience knowledge is produced not only in the context of revelation and fundamental grounding, but in the context of the assessed aftereffect as well (social assessment of technology).

   system; transformation; security; balance of powers; center of power;

AB The author considers the global changes to be an intrinsic part of the continuing formation of a new international political system, which is replacing the classical bipolarity; thereby, he opposes the approaches that describe the global changes as a process of destruction of the previous world order and the entry into an unstable era of the universal collapse of the "game by the rules". The author pays particular attention to an in-depth analysis of the current configuration of the international system, as well as to various scenarios of its development, such as: the revival of the unipolar world order or some kind of "new bipolarity"; slipping down to chaos; recreation of the "concert of nations" or multipolarity as a fundamentally new global configuration of power. The article analyzes the dynamics of the global centers of development, the corresponding downward and upward trends, the transformation of geopolitical space, and formation of the new actors of the global politics. Upon studying the structural shifts in the transforming inner hierarchy of the international system (including the expansion of the pool of countries aspiring to the core of the world international political system), the author concludes that a new configuration and a new balance of power are taking their shape on the global and the regional level. The author sees the global balance of this emerging new global hierarchy, in the context of virtually inevitable new global cleavages, as one of the key challenges facing the world community. In this framework, crucial role is played by the existing and newly built mechanisms and formats of the global regulation. In conclusion, the author discusses the most acute problems of international political development, namely provision of the global security, the nuclear nonproliferation regime, the mechanisms for containing transboundary use of force, the country status of territories, as well as sets forth the task and criteria for achieving a mature world order.

Although it is assumed that most of e-projects in such countries failed, we argue that in some contexts such initiatives can survive in the hostile environment and achieve relatively positive results, leading to limited institutional changes. We adapt the pockets of effectiveness framework in order to analyze the Our Petersburg portal (St. Petersburg, Russia). Our findings suggest that such electronic "pockets" may emerge as a deliberate policy of the political elite in an attempt to make institutions work properly. The key factors of such projects' success relate to agency, namely the political patronage and control, policy entrepreneurship, as well as organization autonomy and the power of the initiative.

AB The article explores the mutual determination of crises that replaced the "stability" of the 2000s in Russia. The period since 2009 witnessed a rapid accumulation and condensation of contradictions in different spheres, from the economic crisis of 2009 to the political crisis of 2011-2012, to the "geopolitical" crisis of 2014, and finally, to the new cycle of the economic crisis that started in 2014. The author establishes the connection between these crises and the political-economic order that emerged in Russia in the 2000s. This order is characterized by the reproduction of peripheral capitalism under the aegis of the regime that combines neo-patrimonial practices with the dominance of bureaucratic elites characteristic of Bonapartism. The 2009 economic crisis revealed the vulnerability of this political-economic order. In turn, the mass protests of 2011-2012 changed the terms of the relationship between society and the state, and triggered the transformation of the regime that increasingly relied on ideology and repression. The ideological mobilization characteristic of Putin's third term was reinforced by Russia's actions in Ukraine in 2014. This "patriotic" mobilization has taken place against the background of economic stagnation and decline that have testified to the exhaustion of Russia's model of peripheral capitalism. The article ends with an analysis of the contradictions and potential points of tension in Russian society generated by continuing economic problems.

ID RADICAL RIGHT; PARTIES
AB The article notes that a lack in the political science literature of agreed definition of contemporary populism significantly complicates identification and classification of the political forces that represent this phenomenon. The article examines differences existing in academic researches concerning estimations of the quantitative parameters of European populist parties and their current electoral base. At the same time, the author presents its own calculations of the scale and forms of "populist wave" in Europe, according to which there are today about 90 populist parties in 31 European countries with average level of electoral support of 27% at the general elections in the period from 2013 to the beginning of 2017. As to the explanations of the driving forces of current populist wave, the article notes the absence of sufficient empirical evidence of direct links between the rise of populism and the recent crisis in the European economies. The article underlines that the very economic crisis is viewed by academic community not as the cause of the strengthening of populist tendencies, but only as a catalyst, that intensifies the role of a number of other factors, among which ethno-cultural factor is of particular importance. Special attention is paid to the political scientists' views on the relationship between today's populism and democracy. The article argues that political science increasingly considers as a distinctive feature of contemporary populism its hostility not to democracy as such, but rather towards its liberal component. In conclusion, the author describes the populist impact on changes of the European political landscape and argues that these changes require a rethinking of the problem of differentiation the systemic political parties and populist political forces.

This project is primarily economic and is targeted at accelerating China's socioeconomic development under new challenges in the global arena. These challenges include the reduction of export possibilities in the traditional markets of the United States, the European Union, and East Asia as a result of decreased global economic growth rates and the attempt of the United States to weaken China's political and economic positions by creating two new structures-the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. A paper on this topic was presented by A.V. Ostrovskii at a session of the RAS Presidium in April 2017.

   strategy; defense; foreign policy
AB The article is dedicated to one of the most important problems of European and international politics - the future of the European Union, which is experiencing the most difficult period in its history. The challenges to European integration are explained by the coincidence and combination of several crises. Those are the internal systemic crisis of the entire European construction, symbolized by the UK's decision to leave the EU, and several overlapping external crises - the consequences of the global economic and financial crisis, the migration crisis, the crisis in relations with Russia around the conflict in Ukraine and the Euro-Atlantic crisis. The future of European integration, scenarios and models of its evolution have always been central to both politicians and European scholars, and have acquired great importance after the referendum on the UK's withdrawal from the EU. Today's discussion within the European Union on the future of European integration covers both the directions for further institutional development of the EU and the conceptual support for its reform in key areas - the restoration of democratic legitimacy, the definition of the differentiation parameters (flexible geometry) and the formulation of economic priorities. The analysis of the basic documents adopted by the EU leadership in 2016-2017 as a response to old problems and new challenges to the future of European integration is the focal point of this article. The dilemma of "More Europe or more fragmentation?", which some politicians are now raising in the EU, is a false choice, because there may be "more Europe" and "more fragmentation" at the same time. This is proved by the fundamental EU documents, adopted at a turning point in the history of European integration. At times, an avant-garde of countries that are ready to go further in promoting integration than other is the necessary precondition for progress. The concept of a multi-speed or different-speed Europe is rejected by the new EU members, but whatever the name, it is the concept of flexible integration that allows avant-garde countries to promote integrationist projects. From the very beginning, European integration developed under the influence of constantly emerging crises. In order to make these crises generate new energy, but not cause paralysis, it is necessary to have a well thought strategy and an adequate political leadership that maintains close relations with European citizens, without whose support it is impossible to break Eurosceptic and nationalistic sentiments. In other words, to avoid the collapse of Europe, European politicians will have to radically rethink the mistakes of the past and answer the challenges of the present.

   INFORMATIONAL JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE mentality; culture; history challenges; sociocultural tension;
   constructive tension; mentality functions; innovation and tradition
AB Category of mentality has additional heuristic capabilities compared to traditional categories of the mental life. Firstly, it serves as an integral characteristic of the uniqueness of the man's mental world, and secondly, ensures an understanding of the specific type of perception of the world by the subject, thirdly, explains the distinct way of subject's activity - his behavior, communication, performance. Since mentality determines the mode of activity of a social group or an individuum, the human activity orientation and its specificity, mentality can be interpreted as a core of the group and personal culture, as well as a strategic cultural program of the subject. One of the basic clashes of society is a contradiction between mentality, containing new cultural forms, and the social relations. In the course of the individual cultural creativity development as a response to the multiple challenges of history, new mental characteristics are generated in the mentality of the intellectual elite`s representatives. They come up with innovative programs of human being activity - performance, behavior, communication. The new mental characteristics spread in society and become components of group mentalities. This accrued contradiction between the mass mentality and the old social relations generates a constructive tension; overcoming of the tension through the reproductive activity of subjects can establish more progressive social relations. Social inertia and conservatism are in turn intrinsic to the old elements of mentality. They can obstruct the establishment of new social relations. Therefore, mentality is of contradictory nature, embodying the dual opposition of tradition and innovation. At the same time mentality is a stimulating factor of the social progress, and a factor that holds back excessively large and rapid social changes. There are many driving forces of the society development: changes in a way of material production, in the culture in general and in education in particular, in engineering, in science. But the most significant force, apparently, displays the changes in mentality that generate new forms of reproductive activity of the subject in the economic, political, social and mental spheres.

AB The article is devoted to the comparative analysis of the concepts of information sovereignty of the state (of state sovereignty in the information space) in the foreign Russian political and legal science, as well as their legislative implementation in the Russian Federation. The author described a cyclic change of sovereignty and globalization trends in the legal regulation of information relations, including those existing at the present stage of sovereignty, doctrinal highlighted the problem of determining the nature and content of the category information of the sovereignty of the state, its difference from the traditional territorial binding national sovereignty. Based on the analysis of the Constitutional Court practice, the analysis highlights the properties (attributes) of the state. The paper consistently examines foreign approaches to the definition of the information content of the sovereignty of the state in terms of development of information relations with the 1980s to the modern concepts of sovereignty and the sovereignty of the digital data, carried out their periodization, chronologically associated with the development of information technologies. The necessity of development of publicly-legal doctrine of the sovereignty of the information, as well as the conclusion that the implementation of state sovereignty in the information space should be carried out by means of information and functions of the state information policy, characterized by the existing scientific approaches to the content of these categories. Based on the analysis of the Russian legislation, the analysis highlights the elements of the legal institutionalization of state sovereignty, including the definition of its scope; attribution of sovereignty to the purposes and principles of the legal regulation in the relevant field; assignment of protecting the sovereignty of the powers of public authorities. Conducted on the basis of the above mentioned analysis of the key elements of allocated federal laws in the sphere of information relations has shown the absence of legislative institutionalization of information sovereignty of the state in these federal laws. To ensure the institutionalization of the legislative sovereignty of the state of the information substantiated a number of suggestions for improving the federal laws in the sphere of information relations.

TI FROM REGIONALISM TO TRANSREGIONALISM: THEORETIC UNDERSTANDING OF A NEW
   REALITY
SO SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Region; macroregion; megaregion; regionalization; regionalism;
   interregionalism; transregionalism
AB Regionalism as an international phenomenon dates back to post-WWII decades. It is well studied both in theoretical and practical perspective. It is quite clear to most researchers what the "old" or "new" regionalism is, and what kind of logic stands behind it. However, the classic theory of regionalism does not explain contemporary processes of interregional and transregional integration, which we witness today. A common point of the three approaches (namely, regionalism, interregionalism and transregionalism) is that all of them are related to globalization. Each of these approaches constitutes a response to globalisation's challenges, which varies from region to region. Nevertheless, their aims and scope differ greatly. Regionalism represents interstate and transnational co-operation within an international region. It is derived from the logic of institutionalized interactions that may take a range of forms-from regular consultations on the ministerial level to creation of supranational bodies and common policies. Interregional co-operation implies institutionalized agreements between states representing two or more regions, which can act either on their own (i.e. quasi-interregionalism, or hybrid interregionalism) or as a part of a regional organization / informal regional group of states. The logic of interregionalism dwells on the wish for widening the geographic scope of economic interaction by opening new regional markets. Transregional cooperation, on the contrary, is promoted primarily by political factors, such as the wish of some states, which share common values, to unite their efforts in order to play a greater role in global governance. It is argued that the study of regionalism, interregionalism and transregionalism can make an essential contribution to the development of the contemporary theory of international relations.

ID OCCUPY; MOVEMENT
AB This article analyzes global dynamics of all the major indicators of sociopolitical destabilization in 2011-2015. The authors come to the conclusion that after the beginning of the Arab Spring, explosive global growth was observed for the overwhelming majority of indicators of socio-political destabilization for anti-government demonstrations, riots, general strikes, terrorist acts / guerrilla warfare and purges. It was also observed for the global integral index of socio-political destabilization. On the other hand, no statistically significant growth was observed for assassinations and political crises. On the other hand, for such an important indicator of global socio-political destabilization, as a global number of coups and coup attempts, there was a statistically significant decrease. In 2011, the number of major anti-government demonstrations in the world increased in a particularly dramatic way (11.5 times, that is, more than by an order of magnitude). At the same time, there was a noticeably less intensive (approximately 6-fold) increase in the global number of riots, while the number of major terrorist attacks in this year only doubled. The global number of major anti-government demonstrations in 2012-2013 slightly decreased, while the global intensity of riots continued to grow, coming close to the intensity of anti-government demonstrations. The global number of major terrorist attacks in 2011-2014 grew exponentially, exceeding in 2014 the number of both major anti-government demonstrations and riots. In general, it can be said that the growth of the global number of riots followed the growth of the number of anti-government demonstrations with a certain lag, and the increase in the number of terrorist acts was somewhat lagging relative to both of them.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE self-government; local authorities; trust; democracy; political
   institutions; political participation; civic engagement; accessibility
   of public authorities
AB The article studies the causes of the crisis in local self-government. According to the author, the difficulties with the development of this political institution are related not so much to the lack of financial and human resources, as to the discrepancy between the theory of local self-government and the real practice of municipal government. As an argument in support of his hypothesis, the author cites research data from the Institute of Sociology of the Russian Academy of Sciences, indicating an extremely low level of trust in local authorities. These results are discordant to the theoretical notions of local self-government, as the power closest to ordinary citizens. The appeal to the concept of "trust" allows the author to link the negative attitude of society towards local self-government bodies with such factors as, firstly, the residents' lack of confidence in the professionalism of these structures, secondly, the reduction in the number of municipal deputies and officials directly elected by citizens, and, finally, alienation of local authorities from ordinary citizens. The data of sociological research presented in the article show that for today the society does not perceive local authorities as "self-governing bodies", but the theoretical concept "local self-government" is estimated rather positively so far. According to the author's position, the state of democracy in the country exerts more influence on the attitude of society towards local self-government. The development of plebiscite factors in the political regime and the concentration of attention on the figure of the head of state change the attitude towards all other institutions. For public opinion, they become insignificant and insignificant. The author ends the article with the conclusion that local self-government can regain public confidence only after a democratic political culture and rights and freedoms are rooted in the country. Achieving these conditions will ensure the wide participation of citizens in the activities of local authorities.

ID HISTORY
AB This article is based of analysis an extensive array of historical documents, scientific literature and journalism, in particular the diocesan press of the XIX - early XX century, on the assessment of the ethnopolitical landscape of the Arkhangelsk province at the turn of the century. The authors focus their attention on the historical, social, religious and legal prerequisites for the formation of the ethnopolitical landscape of the Arkhangelsk Governorate, which was home to four imperial "inorodtsy" ethnic groups: the Saami, the Karelians, the Nenets and the Komi. The authors, on the basis of the official press of the local diocese, represent the theoretical concept of the involvement of "inorodtsy" in the general socio-cultural and internal political space of the Empire. The article analyzes the way of life of the indigenous population, mode of life, customs, social stratification, ethnocultural specifics, worldview and religious and other characteristics, as well as interaction with the Russian (Slavic) population, officials and church apparatus. The localization of the research component on one of the largest historical territories of the Russian North and the Russian Arctic makes it possible to examine more narrowly and in detail the provincial ethnocultural specifics. The retrospective analysis allows looking at the ethnopolitics of modern Russia taking into account regional specialization. The ethno-cultural issues considered in the article are of fundamental importance in connection with the socio-political and historical-legal discussion on the issue of the cultural collective rights of small ethnic groups: indigenous peoples and national minorities. Particular attention is paid to the historical experience of the work of the Orthodox clergy to "incorporate" local ethnic groups into the all-Russian spiritual space in order to promote the territorial and cultural unity of Imperial Russia.

AB The article focuses on the theoretical and practical explanations of political and economic processes in the "post-Western" international reality. Proceeding from the assumptions of the complex system theory, the authors prove the necessity to use already established analytical approaches in combination with the newly developed ones to be able to understand and forecast the spatial-temporal evolution of the international system as a complex system. International political economy and world regional studies now investigate the empirical aspects of working out the most competitive and simultaneously most stable socio-political and political-economic model of development. These studies also search for the ways national versions of development can become closer to this model and analyze to what extent regional/national models may differ from it without losing their international competitiveness. Exploring the evolution of the international system and political and economic transformations in the world leading states the authors conclude that a polycentric world cannot sustain a growing geopolitical confrontation and struggle for the geopolitical influence over the buffer areas. The polycentric international system requires a consensual elaboration of mutually beneficial regional policies aimed at building transregional links between various regional areas. Reducing the instability in its regional and national segments the international system will move towards its overall greater stability. The authors further support this assumption analyzing transregional projects in Eurasia and the Asia-Pacific region.

TI Between Scholarship and Dissidence: The Dissident Historical Collection
   Pamiat' (1975-1982)
SO SLAVIC REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID CULTURE
AB This article examines the history of the Soviet dissident historical collection Pamiat' through the lens of liminality. It argues that the publication sought to bridge the gap between dissident and professional scholarship, between grassroots memory collection, with its emphasis on the witness's voice, and historical research's reliability and "scientificity." Although Pamiat' was inspired by earlier dissident historiographical projects and its editorial team was closely linked to the human-rights movement, its ambitions of objectivity and representativeness also connect it to later Perestroika projects based on citizen involvement, such as Memorial. Pamiat's ambiguous identity and claim to neutrality may have delayed the Soviet authorities' response to it, but repression eventually hit the publication. By putting into question the state's monopoly on historical scholarship and connecting readers and contributors across the Iron Curtain, Pamiat' had clearly overstepped the boundaries of the permissible and acquired a political meaning it disingenuously claimed not to have.

AB The article deals with the transformation of German energy market from a rigid traditional system towards an environmental-friendly one. This process partly coincides with similar developments in EU but in some aspects is far ahead of it. In this context the German nuclear power phase-out is a part of a much broader process which aims at replacing traditional generation with green ones with innovative upgrade of the electric grid at the same time. The next logical step at this path should be a coal fires plants phase-out being more harmful for the environment and not fit for new generation grid. To achieve this a broad political consensus is necessary that takes into account the role of coal mining industry in German regions. BRD government is taking first steps in this direction, one of them is the shutdown of several coal firing power stations.

DE problem of joining NATO; Sweden; Finland
AB The author analyzes the stages of convergence of Finland and Sweden with NATO after the collapse of the Soviet Union, assesses the degree of their political and military cooperation, the attitude of political parties and public opinion to the problem of membership of these countries in the North Atlantic Alliance, makes a forecast of further developments. Economically and militarily, Finland and Sweden were ready to join NATO in the early 2000s. At present principal obstacles to a political decision to apply for NATO membership are predominantly negative public opinion in both countries, the lack of political consensus, the need for a referendum, and the dependence on the simultaneous accession of these countries to NATO. Under normal conditions, the window of opportunity for a new round of updating the NATO agenda can only be opened after the parliamentary elections in 2018 and 2019 in Finland and Sweden, which should be preceded by an active pro-NATO propaganda with an unobvious result. In these circumstances, the political establishment of Finland and Sweden, under the pretext of the Ukrainian crisis, initiated the process of joining the Alliance's Host Nation Support program in September 2014. The program gives the two non-NATO countries the opportunity in a situation of aggravation of international relations to accept swift military assistance of the US, bypassing the bureaucratic mechanisms of the Alliance. This poses a greater danger to Russia than the formal membership of Finland and Sweden in NATO.

AB The paper presents the background analysis of the formation of human model in economics. in the conditions of the constantly performing development of the economic science until the neoclassic paradigm and its modifications. Among them is behavioural finance, which presents a special interest for modern researchers. The evolution of the model of making economically significant decisions in inter-temporal and essential dimensions is the subject matter of the research. We have shown that the concept of the economic human model itself is the multidimensional one. In parallel with the processes of economical, social and political changes and economic science development, the economic human model was becoming more complex and relevant for each period of time. In this regard, we followed the stages of defining the concept of "subject rationality". The study determines the significant traits implemented by researchers to create a full and consistent human model. We demonstrate the gradual development of economists' idea of different types of the motivation of economic agents. Along with the financial factors of motivation, the scientists begin to take into account non-financial ones. This approach can help researchers get more "humanistic" view at the economic human. The modern concept of the economic human with attention to its implicit restrictions is formed through the complication of requirements to the rationality and its components crystallization. In the paper, we characterize contribution of the domestic scientists to the development of new directions of economic theory. The research describes the role of different regional economic scientific schools in the process of the formation of the Russian behavioural finance school.

TI MONTESQUIEU'S TREATISE DE L'ESPRIT DES LOIS AND
   FUNDAMENTAL LAWS IN RUSSIA IN THE EARLY 1760s
SO QUAESTIO ROSSICA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE history of concepts; fundamental laws; Ch.-L. Montesquieu; F. H. Strube
   de Piermont; I. I. Shuvalov
AB Relying on the method of the history of concepts, this paper considers how Montesquieu's treatise The Spirit of the Laws had come to be perceived in Russia by 1762, as well as the existence of the concept of "fundamental laws" in the Russian political lexicon. It is demonstrated that among the Russian ruling elite, The Spirit of the Laws had a number of followers, who, however, did not play a leading part in the domestic policy of Elizabethan Russia. By 1762, the treatise had limited circulation, but the fact that some people knew about its ideas did not mean their full and unconditional acceptance of it. Moreover, these ideas could be perceived very critically, as was demonstrated by F.H. Strube de Piermont, professor of the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences. For the Russian ruling elite, The Spirit of the Laws was not the only work about fundamental laws. By the mid-18th century, discourses about such laws were available in the works of several European authors, including S. Pufendorf and F. Fenelon. In the works of such authors, a combination of fundamental laws with a monarchical form of government was associated with the idea of a contract between subjects and the monarch. According to the resources analysed, this understanding of the contractual nature of fundamental laws influenced the draft of the fundamental laws by I. I. Shuvalov (1760-1761) and the Manifesto on the Freedom of the Nobility by Peter III (1762). By the early 1760s, the concept of "fundamental laws" was an essential part of the political language of the Russian ruling elite, and it influenced the understanding of domestic policy and its goals. However, this was not due to the reception of Montesquieu's ideas. At the same time, the reception and use by the ruling elite of concepts describing the form of government and the concept of "fundamental laws" laid the foundations for the perception of the ideas of The Spirit of the Laws. As a result, the main innovation of this treatise in Russia was not the use of the concept of "fundamental laws", but its reinterpretation.

AB The focus of the article is on one of the turning points in the education development in Russia of the late imperial period, i.e., the establishment of women's higher education in the second half of the 19th century. The researchers involved various sources, including periodicals, ego-documents, documents of management and record keeping obtained from regional archives, regulatory documents and directories for a systematic study of the formation process of women's higher education against the backdrop of the socio-political life of the Russian empire going through modernization. The combination of macro- and micro approaches in the context of the theory of modernization and gender-based history made it possible to consider the first women's higher courses as one of the most outstanding achievements made by the progressive public in the struggle for the equality of women as well as the development of women's education. The subject of the study was the women's higher courses, opened in the capital cities (Moscow and St. Petersburg) as well as provincial ones (Kazan and Kiev). The issues under study, being covered in the article, are the ones related to the socio-cultural aspects of the Russian movement for the right to obtain higher education and pedagogical profession up to the beginning of the 20th century. It is shown that Russian women in the struggle for equality with men initially demanded equal rights in the field of education in order to gain the opportunity to expand their professional activities and, consequently, to use their abilities for the benefit of society and achieve economic independence. Instability and constant attack on women's higher courses by the government, concerned about the growth of the revolutionary movement among women and inability to exercise their rights prevented students of women's higher courses from becoming full-fledged students, while the degree they got after graduating from the courses failed to provide them with equal civil and political rights with men. The results of the research can be applied in the practice of modernization of higher education and in studies on the history of Russian education.

AB The article discusses transformation of values in modern Russia. This process does not involve replacing outdated values by more relevant ones, but gradual evolving of values in current social system. Moreover, evolution of values is more intense and adaptive in changeable fields of activities. This approach is implemented through the data analysis of representative polls conducted in 2014-2015 in Moscow (N=800), Moscow region (N =800), Kaliningrad region (N =700) and Astrakhan region (N =700) within the project "A resource of interethnic consent in consolidation of Russian society: general and special in regional diversity" (RSF grant No. 14-18-01963). The total sampling is 3000 respondents. The main conclusion is that content of values for the vast majority of population in studied regions is in process of revision. Less than a third of respondents has systematic traditionalist value dispositions. Therefore, the problem is actualizing, demanding detailed study of the uncertainty value and its possible consequences for social stability. This problem exists riot only in Russia, but also in many countries of Western Europe.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE the history of childbirth; history of midwifery; the medicalization;

AB This article examines the processes behind the transition from traditional to scientific obstetrics in Russia during Late Modern period. Our aim in doing this is to analyse the processes of medicalization and pathologization of birth within medical discourse. To do this we examine Russian obstetric literature since the 1760s to the middle of the nineteenth century. The emergence of scientific obstetrics in Russia in the second half of the eighteenth century was partly due to the development of scientific medicine and the opening of the first educational institutions for 'povituchi'. One barrier to the dissemination of scientific obstetrics came in the form of gender stereotypes claiming it was unacceptable for men to examine the female body. Doctors, seeking to prove their own authority and superiority over traditional obstetrics, wrote about the special political importance of this business. The authority of the science of obstetrics was established through the development of the doctrine of operative obstetrics. Obstetric operations, the use of new technological instruments and gynecological operations became advantages of clinical physicians. Doctors asserted their social control over the sphere of procreation through the pathologization of birth. Clinical space was transformed into the area of experimentation on the female body, which came to be regarded as an object of observation. Women went from being active participants, subjects of labour to becoming passive objects of medical manipulations. The process of medicalization with regards female reproductive health also included obstetric science claiming control over the whole life of the woman: from puberty to pregnancy, childbirth and postnatal restoration. The average 'correct'model was formed as well as 'the wrong childbirth'. Any deviations from these 'norms'became viewed as cause for medical intervention.

AB The article, based on archival documents, shows the role of Professor E.G. Kagarov (1882-1942), an outstanding ethnographer and historian of religion, in creating the theoretical and methodological grounds for the expositions of the Museum of the History of Religion of the Academy of Sciences (1932). Kagarov was of similar minded to V.G. Bogoraz and was his close collaborator in the creation of the Museum as a new academic institution. Of course, Kagarov attracted Bogoraz not only by his encyclopaedic knowledge, but also by using in his works new methodological approaches in comparative religious studies as it was rapidly developing in Europe and Russia at that time. Kagarov's views on mythology and religion, on approaches to the interpretation of sources, as well as on what could serve as a source for the study of ancient religions, differed significantly from the generally accepted ones and went beyond the narrow textual studies accepted in philological tradition. His appeal to the comparative method, the involvement in folklore and ethnography data for the analysis of ancient religion, was innovative for the domestic science. Kagarov believed that, beginning in the second half of the 19th century, in Western Europe the history of religions became an independent discipline, free from confessional frameworks. In Soviet Russia that academic science used "economic materialism" as a method of historical knowledge, treating religion as a reflection of production relations, conditioning the social and political system. The article is accompanied by the publication of the annotated list of works on the history of religion by E. G. Kagarov from the B. G. Bogoraz collection in the St. Petersburg branch of the Archive of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Refs 8.

AB The social, political and economic changes in the Bulgarian society leave their traces in all spheres of the public life, in particular of the military education system. The implemented in the Republic of Bulgaria reforms assign to the Vasil Levski National Military University the task to train logistic officers at a high level of professional skills, who are ready to solve efficiently the assigned tasks.
   The specific character of the logistic officers activity sets increased requirements to their management skills and abilities and to the management effectiveness, related to them. In connection with this the disclosure of holdings of cadets from different specializations logistics management, organizational and communication skills is the topical trend to disclose ways to improve military professional training and formation of readiness for a timely and quality management decision making.
   The research target is the military professional training of the future logistic officers, while the developed in the course of their military professional training management skills, management, organizational and communication skills of the future logistic officers are subject of research. The research aim is to analyze the acquired in the course of the military professional training of the future logistic officers management skills and abilities and the related to them management effectiveness. The methods of research are: a theoretical analysis of the military education literature is used during the research; also the methods of inquiry, statistics, substantiation and general conclusion.

DE Urban; Land use; Arctic; Planning; Development
AB This chapter investigates the role of land use planning in the context of arctic urban development through six city-profiles. Urbanisation in the Arctic is driven by a range of socio-economic and political factors. Not least, these include political processes to concentrate public services and a withdrawal from state-led socio-economic planning, economic processes that have led to the development of labour markets and new social institutions that are needed for reproducing the labour force. While these processes create development opportunities, they also have a wide range of spatial impacts and these require increased attention toward urban land-use planning. Through the city-profiles, we suggest that effective urban land use planning in the Arctic is highly context dependent. Significant issues appear to include: the importance of preserving relationships between society and the natural environment; the necessity in some cases for planning measures in response to significant urban sprawl; the recognition of complex governance structures that influence development strategies; and even the necessity for planning responses to suburban sprawl.

TI The Biosphere as a Living System. On the Harmonization of Human and

ID ECOSYSTEM; EVOLUTION
AB The evolution of the biosphere has led to creation of astrophysical and telluric stable perfect system biotic regulation, which based on a high degree of closure of natural cycles. The development of human beings as bio-social, beyond the biological patterns, break these closed cycles, and dramatically broke the biotic regulation of the biosphere. As results - sustainable biosphere has become unsustainable anthroposphere. As with the origin of life physico-chemical regularities of the structure of matter turned out to be "mastered" life, as soon as with the emergence of anthroposphere physical-chemicalbiological regularities of evolution are complemented by social ones (including technology development and of the technosphere - as the essential content of anthroposphere).
   The result of the violation of natural biotic regulation broke a global environmental crisis that boomerang begins it is dangerous to human. It is theoretically possible to overcome this ecological crisis by the transition from the Neolithic paradigm of "nature conquest", to the organization of "crisis management" of the biosphere (world system governance) by the activity of the society restore and "repair" the damaged processes in the biosphere.
   This requires a new organization in all areas of human activity, i.e., a fundamentally new paradigm of human behavior on the planet. Development within the paradigm of the Neolithic culture (extensive use of natural resources, is inevitably associated with different kinds of wars in their redistribution), leads to an increasing accumulation of non-degradable waste (tertiary anthropogenic products), determines the fatal instability of anthroposphere and, therefore, unsustainable development of civilization. It is a mistake to assume that human's dependence on nature is reduced - it takes a different form.
   The forces of human as an intelligence being, "recollecting himself", about the offense with lifesupporting bioshere' systems, and based on the concept of controlled evolution (at first stages of crisis governance), to assist nature to restore the disturbed natural regulations of biospheric processes. For this it need to find out what the thresholds ("planetary bounders") for allowable violations of natural processes are already accomplished, and develop a plan of action for the reduction of disturbances, relying on the regenerative potential of living nature and resources of the human mind.
   Theoretically, to restore the homeostasis of the biosphere will be possible, apparently, not earlier than will be solved the problem of disposing (recycling) of the tertiary anthropogenic production and increase the primary production. It is unclear at what energy level will be after a restoration of homeostasis of the biosphere, and how this new level will affect humanity (including its number). It is not clear whether it is possible to create a sustainable anthroposphere (is not this destructive human destroying activity passing through the "point of no return"?).
   Consideration of the place and role of human in the biosphere leads to the conclusion that only biological approach to the study of the modern biosphere evolution is inadequate. Human went beyond existence in the framework of the biological laws, possessed not available to other species natural resources, the biological evolution of human is replaced by the bio-social one. Regularities of this process are not yet clear. Among the objective difficulties of solving the problems of the transition to controlled evolution - a fundamental difference in the speed of evolution of civilization (technical, cultural) and rate of biological and biosphere evolution. Some of the features of technological and cultural evolution give some hope for overcome these difficulties. For example, significantly reduced specific consumption of materials and substances with the growing knowledge-intensity of production, considerably increasing the volume of recycling industrial and household waste, developing of environmental engineering and "green economy", construction of "smart city" - all this are signals on the evolution of human society and the biosphere.
   There are three main areas of action for the restoration of violated human homeostasis of the biosphere:
   Increased of primary production.
   Reduction of the consuments' pressure.
   Reducing the production (and utilization) of tertiary products. Among possible courses of action to stabilize life-support systems of the biosphere:
   Increase the area of natural ecosystems (increase the natural biomass).
   Stabilization and restoration of biodiversity (including maintaining a safe level of the number of threatened species and ecosystems, as well as control the populations of synanthropic species);
   The restoration of the broken biomes;
   The deurbanization of the "sealed" areas;
   Reduction of the human population load. It appears that extensive (on the basis of the Neolithic paradigm of resource use) development humankind cannot continue for more than two next generations (also thanks to the increase of the population load). It is possible that human is irreversibly violated homeostasis of the biosphere, which is now the "rolls" to a more primitive and volatile state. In this case, the biosphere will not be able to sustain the current human population -this number will begin to decline in 30-40 years. To move from ideas (concepts) "crisis management" and " controlled evolution" to the development of the theory of this process need the work of specialists in all branches of natural sciences, technology and anthropology as three main directions:
   Ecologists, physicians, geneticists, physiologists, zoologists, soil scientists, botanists and other natural scientists must determine the critical parameters of anthroposphere, i.e. those that urgently need to recover, and those that cannot with impunity violate in the future.
   Chemists, physicists, engineers, technologists, computer science needs to find a path of total transition to low-waste and low-energy technologies, fundamentally reduce the size of the "ecological footprint" of human. Philosophers, sociologists, psychologists and all public leaders should help in the formulation of a new worldview and morality. Without a change of the Neolithic paradigms of social-economic development, it is impossible to stop the degradation of the biosphere. For such paradigm shift, it is necessary knowledge and political will. There are basic knowledge for it, but political will is absent. Society torn by religious and economic contradictions, still proceeds in its activities from traditionally understanding of the "national security" and the lulling concept of "sustainable development". The price of misunderstanding the importance of an immediate shift in the paradigm of development - the degradation not only of the biosphere, but also human.

AB Rapid ascent of Donald Trump to the top of the American power pyramid seriously alarmed business and political establishments in most states of Europe, Latin America and other regions. The explanation is obvious: in the course of the election campaign and after the election, the new American leader made a lot of hard and uncompromising statements, and then, having settled down in the White House, took a number of concrete steps against trade, economic and socio-political interests of a series of countries. In essence, Washington' actions pour oil on the flame of global instability and uncertainty, and can complicate the process of overcoming problems of the entire world community in time of crisis, generated by both internal causes of individual countries and international effects. The central question of the future global order is which policies will become the world center of gravity: formation of a cooperation strategy of integration, alliances and multilateral agreements, or a course on isolationism and protectionism, financial-economic pressure, "cold" trade and currency wars. Taking the path of frankly revisionist style policies, Donald Trump showed himself an opponent to the global economic agenda that had seemed unshakable and indicated the direction of further movement for the entire international community until recently. Contrary to what was argued by numerous experts and politicians, President Trump does not believe the United States is the main beneficiary of globalization, which Washington himself imposed on the rest of the world some time ago. The American President regards other countries as winners in an all-out international competition: China, Germany, Mexico, etc. The U.S. are by no means on the top of this list, and Trump intends to change the status quo and implement a geo-economical script appropriate to his views of the world. "The Trump Factor" becomes the key element in the process of transformation of the prevailing globalization image.

AB The article addresses the little known chapters in the history of the Northern Frontier, namely the Russian-Norwegian borderland, touching upon the role of the Lapp crafts in the history of Russian-Norwegian relations in the period between 1855 and 1900, therewith considering the influence of the "flexible" Russian-Norwegian border's symbolic space on the evolvement and development of such relations. The authors demonstrate how minor fishing and herding exercised by a few dozen Russian Sami people in Norway shaped the image of the "Russian threat". Beginning from the 1850s, this circumstance paired with the issue of Finnish migrants urged regional authorities towards implementation of measures aimed at the frontier consolidation with Finnmark, also known as the Norwegization politics followed by promotion through the diplomatic channels of the idea to eliminate the Sami servitudes.
   Russian general public as well as regional and imperial officials responded to the Norwegian policy by means of nation-wide symbolic and political justification of the "flexible borders" that existed in the first half of the 19th century, specifically via recognition of the old borderline passing Veres Navolok as the true border; disapproval of the 1825-1826 demarcation; and pleading to readdress the 1828 matter on reconsidering the borderline in order to protect the livelihood rights of the Russian Lapps in Sweden and Norway.
   Thus, Swedish-Norwegian border policy focused on driving the Pasvick River Sami away from their traditional lands, along with a dynamic Norwegian colonization of the Western Murman contributed to the image of the "Russian threat" and gradual securitization of the Lapp Crafts in Russia at the turn of the 20th century.

   power station; EU environmental policy; green energy; renewables
AB The article deals with the policies of EU countries towards coal power plants as well as practical steps taken by their governments. Coal power plants are widely considered to be environmentally harmful which confronts with environmental policies of the EU suggesting Europe-wide cuts of greenhouse gas emissions. Based on that assumption a number of EU countries such as Belgium, Austria, Portugal, Dania, Finland, Sweden and UK are striving to phase out coal power plants and achieved significant progress on this path replacing coal with other generation sources. On the other hand, other EU members are lagging behind as coal phase-out is not an urgent item of their political agenda. This situation is typical for Ireland, Netherlands, Italy, Croatia, Slovenia and Slovakia. Domestic coal extracting industry can pose a significant hindering factor for a coal power plants phase-out and can effectively block the process. This is the case in Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Czech Republic, Greece and Poland. But Germany, which also has a well-developed coal industry, transforms its energy sector towards a green one cutting the share of coal in the generation mix. If this effort of the German government proves successful it will deliver a positive transformation model for other EU countries with a large share of coal in generation-mix due to domestic coal extraction industry. The analysis of the political and economic (both macro and micro) processes leads to conclusion that there is no unity among EU member states in their approach towards coal fired power plants phase-out. This will allow for coal power plants to retain their market share in a short to medium term. But in the longer run one can expect a significant decrease of coal fired generation in Europe, even in the countries traditionally dependent on coal.

DT Article
DE science; ethos; creativity; alienation; knowledge society
AB The article presents a socio-philosophical analysis of the transformation process of research activity at the present stage. This process is characterized by two trends: the "knowledge society" changes in the social sphere due to the transformation of knowledge in the human environment and the science is shifting focus toward the application of scientific knowledge in the technologies improvement adjusted on the perception of science by society. The article relying on the activity approach shows how the increased social role of science is changing the norms of scientific activity, scientific creativity, its nature and structure, the challenges faced by the subject of knowledge. The great potential of acitivity approach to the analysis of specificity of scientific activities is illustrated, which can be applied to the analysis of both theoretical and practical problems in the field of science and scientific management development. It is shown that scientific activity which aims at the achievement of objective knowledge and truth is exposed today to the serious test by sociality. Evaluation without regard to the purpose of the activity, in terms of a particular social situation, may seriously alter the nature of this activity and its focus and distort its purpose. The resulting situation is analyzed in which scientific work is alienated when the scientific labour is turned into activity opposing to itself. The situation of alienation is created when several combined factors, specific research activities, such as intentions, ideas, interests, conditions, etc., associated in the network of feedbacks begin to exist separately. Basing on the ideas of K. Marx, R. Merton the need for ethical component in the activities is demonstrated, which also works to preserve the important principle of universality (universal access) of the scientific work and its results. The ambivalent nature of the ethos of science and the relationship between science and the social sphere is demonstrated by discussions around the "open access" policy and the examples of violation of the principle of universality and other principles of the ethos of science (CUDOS) in the scientific community. Thus, it is concluded that the orientation of science toward "pure" profit, benefit, applicaple results and toward its determination as an assessment, not a goal, may lead to the fact that it will turn into an activity, opposing to itself.

TI TRANSFORMATIONS OF ETHNIC IDENTITY IN DESCENDANTS OF BELARUSIAN
   PEASANTS-MIGRANTS IN SIBERIA AND THE FAR EAST
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Belarusians; ethnic identity; peasant migrations; Siberia; Far East
AB The aim of the article consists in the research of transformations of ethnic identity in descendants of Belarusian peasantsmigrants of Siberia and the Far East. The source basis of the research includes field data collected by the author in ethnographic expeditions on the territory of 12 regions of Siberia and the Far East during the period from 2009 to 2017, the national structure of the explored regions reflected in population censuses from 1897 to 2010 and also publications about local history of different years. Results of the research indicate that at the time of mass agrarian migrations of the second half of the 19th-the beginning of the 20th centuries the ethnic identity of most Belarusians was not created yet. Due to the internal nature of migrations, peasants identified their homeland with Russia. Their identity had regional rather than ethnic differentiation. In Siberia Belarusian migrants began to live near the Russian old resident population and received a new social and cultural status which found reflection in the wide use of the name "samokhod" (lit. "self-movers"). After the establishment of the Soviet power, administrative and political factors initiated the process of belarusization. Results of the All-Union population census of 1926 showed that most migrants already identified themselves with Belarusians. In the 1930s-1940s the socio-political and economic factors of collectivization and industrialization as well as the consequences of World War II led to serious demographic changes in places of compact accommodation of Belarusian peasants-migrants. As a result of urbanization and modernization of the way of life of the Soviet village in the second half of the 20th century, most descendants of Belarusian peasants-migrants began to identify themselves with Russians or just did not think about their ethnic origin. Since the 1990s, the author observes a growth of interest of professional researchers and amateur enthusiasts in the history and traditional culture of Belarusian peasants-migrants as in historical and cultural heritage. On this background, the Belarusian ethnic identity begins to develop again among people who are interested in traditions of their ancestors. Today, mediated information dominates in its formation rather than intergenerational historical memory. The author comes to a conclusion that during different periods of time a number of demographic, political, social and cultural factors had impact on features of ethnic identity of descendants of Belarusian peasants-migrants. Therefore, today it is considered more suitable to use the concept "descendants of Belarusian peasants-migrants" rather than the ethnonym "Belarusian" when referring to offsprings of people who moved from Belarus to Siberia and the Far East in the second half of the 19th-the beginning of the 20th centuries.

AB The paper defines the terrorist acts as a combination of factors that have a negative impact on the economic, social and natural environment of society. The UNWTO is a hub for these joint activities to organize tourism security. The distinguishing and novel feature of the organization is that, whilst most organizations provide international security for people permanently residing in a certain territory, the UNWTO interacts exclusively with relocated persons. The work undertaken by the UNWTO specifies that the threat in the tourism industry has a character of mutual exclusion in the aspect of presenting political claims as the causes of terrorism and reducing economic and social indicators as consequences of the activities of terrorist groups.

AB The main goal of our paper is to analyze Arendt's idea of the influence of revolutions on the public real by examining its theoretical and practical scope. In the course of our analysis, we will also answer the question whether Arendt's understanding of revolution could be used in the modern context. After a critical investigation of Arendt's idea of revolution and of her thesis about the impact of revolution on the public realm, we will briefly investigate several examples of modern revolutions from an 'Arendtian' standpoint in order to draw a conclusion about the current applicability of Arendt's key arguments concerning violence, power, social issues, collective political action and communication.

AB The article analyzes the prospects for the formation of a smart society as a stage of social progress as a result of the active application of smart technologies in social reality. The concepts of progress (R. Nisbet, P. Shtompka, K.Kh. Momdzhyan) are considered to determine the criteria for assessing the processes of social progress. Based on the derived criteria, social transformations caused by the use of smart technologies are analyzed. It is concluded that it is impossible to consider such transformations as a new stage of social progress at the present stage. At the same time, it cannot be ruled out that in the future the smart society will become such a new stage.

DE politics of memory; social memory; Koselleck; relativistic chronotope
AB The article is devoted to the analysis and understanding of features of contemporary politics of memory. In particular, and successful, attempts to influence the political situation, using the resource of the past, existed quite a long time. But in "a mistrust of the grand narratives" (J. F. Lyotard), the structuring of social temporality, past, present and future flow into each other, creating a "time Mobius". The past is not considered as an ontological category, therefore, the contemporary politics of memory is related not to the past but to the present. Images of the past become simulacra of the third order (J. Baudrillard), and the past is perceived by actors as a resource that you can use to realize their ambitions. Print capitalism (B. Anderson) was allowed to broadcast uniform content that was required for the formation of the "imagined community". In the contemporary information space the official institutions of broadcast experience of previous generations not compete with new media. In these circumstances, the past is a product that needs promotion and advertising, and the state does not define a strategy for dealing with the past, and is forced to play by mature rules. In the presence of competing interpretations of any of the images of the past, the priority remains for the one that will be more accessible and/or more interesting, so the user can "imagine" themselves part of different communities, and civic identity will not act as a main. Things are changing our world more than it seems at first glance. Modern media have influenced the style of human thinking (L. Manovich), so the modern consumer of information easily become a source, but it ceases to be a "man of understanding" (M. Heidegger). "Relativistic chronotope" (P. Valerio) changes the relationship between the "horizon of expectations" and "space of experience" (R. Koselleck). Thanks to the information noise around, the experience is not limited to the traditional institutions of the broadcast. In the ever-increasing background and decreasing expectations, which is difficult to use the term "horizon", the politics of memory acts as a situational action and not a purposeful process. The state cannot compete with other actors using the resource of the past to achieve their goals.

AB The rich tradition of Siberian science and higher education is little known outside Russian academic circles. Using institutional history, this article focuses on the founding and pre-war period of the Siberian Physical Technical Institute, the establishment of its research focus and its first difficult steps to become a leading centre of R & D in Siberia. Based on archival materials, the article describes how local and national physicists justified the institute's creation by demonstrating ties with industry and building on the presence of a cohort of locally trained physicists, whose numbers were augmented by Leningrad specialists. The strength of local cadres enabled the institute to navigate civil war and cultural revolution successfully. Physicists were able to take advantage of ongoing industrialization campaigns to gain support to create the institute, although local disputes and economic problems slowed its further development. The article describes the circulation of scientific, political and philosophical knowledge between Moscow, Leningrad and the provinces, and the impact of Bolshevik rule and Stalinism on the Siberian physics enterprise.

ID NATIONALISM
AB The article presents a political-psychological approach to the analysis of patriotism as a political value. The author pays attention to the conceptual polysemy of the concept of "patriotism", its relation to the concepts of "citizenship" and "nationalism". The author relies on the concept of the unity of cognitive, affective and behavioral components in the structure of the personality. The formation of patriotism occurs in the process of political socialization under the influence of its political and cultural conditions, institutions and factors. The result of this process is the presence of a triad of interrelated elements in a person: the values of patriotism, the content of which is revealed in the system of representations about one's own country, positive emotions for the Motherland and socially acceptable forms of civic engagement and political behavior. The author considers the state of patriotism in Russian society on the basis of his own empirical data and attracts data from research centers from open sources. As a result of the analysis, the author comes to the conclusion that Russian citizens have a common positive emotional attitude to their country, its history and culture. However, the value of patriotism is not the most important for them, the system of representations about patriotism is insufficiently formed, and behavioral attitudes are poorly expressed. For effective work on the formation of patriotism, it is necessary to define the semantic content of the concept of "patriotism" in its broad historical and cultural interpretation. At the same time, patriotism can not be the sole basis of a national idea. A broader coordinated system of political values is needed, which reflects the values and representations most important to citizens, including patriotic ones. At the same time, the author notes the existence of positive tendencies in the process of patriotic work. This, for example, the implementation of state programs on patriotic education of citizens and the active interest of scientists in carrying out theoretical and empirical studies of the problem of patriotism.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE state; business; interests; conflict; corruption; goods/money
   relationship; property
AB The article reviews the conflictive nature of corruption qua a systematically organized social phenomenon. The authors arrive at the conclusion that the roots of corruption lie in the social order itself which is being eroded and disrupted by conflict. At the same time corruption, recognized as some kind of a means which destroys social order, becomes equivalent to conflict. The authors emphasize the conflict studies paradigm's heuristic detecting the potential of corrupt relations to disrupt society to a point beyond which it cannot reproduce itself as a solid and stable organism. The authors demonstrate in the article that the conceptualization of the interdisciplinary method of conflict detection and localization is considered to be the most sought-after method for the state which has declared war against corruption. The article pays special attention to the main points at issue of the interdisciplinary analysis of the corruption phenomenon and research approaches to its examination.
   Moreover the article makes clear that the economic subjects' interaction may be denoted by the concept of "competition", while in the social sphere this interaction may be denoted by the concept of "strife", in political science it may be called "political competition", "political tussle", "crime", "opposition", "protest", "uprising", "revolution". Which conceptual denomination is acquired by the mean of interconnection depends on the ultimate sphere in which this interconnection terminates while it takes various shapes as well.
   In the article the authors analyze corruption as a process of the transformation of an activity and its results into a commodity which has a "uncommodified" nature as a result of a joint, non-contractual, illegal exchange of resources between officials and others. The authors substantiate the necessity of interpreting the term corruption through the lens of a goods/money relationship, by a process which comprises the entire total of social bonds and relations and in first place; i.e., property relations.
   Also, the authors put a special focus on the corrupt relations with respect to relations where public commons are turned into individual private property whereby the official only passes to a private actor something that does not belong to him ipso jure. Refs 29.

AB The author regards in this article the questions, which are connected with the ontological and epistemological foundations of the theoretical international studies. IR as science reflects the main features of the dominating at the epoch scientific world pictures as the way of cognition. As the term "scientific world picture" was formulated by the German philosopher Martin Heidegger as well as by the most prominent scholars of the first part of the 20th century - by M. Planck, A. Einstein, N. Bohr, E. Schrodinger etc. Even if some contribution in the development of sciences was done already in the period of Antiquity and Middle Ages, the scientific world picture was formulated only with the transition to Modernity, with the exude of the human being from nature. Being based on the typology, done be the Russian academician philosopher V.S. Stepin. the author regards the specifics the main scientific world pictures, and their consequences in the classical, non classical and post non classical science. By the way, the IR science with great difficulties accepts the new worldview, at its main part still functioning in a sense of the Newtonian mechanistic world picture. Even if the attempts have been made to be fitted into the new scientific world pictures, the gap between the natural and social sciences is still difficult to overcome, and the usage of the newest world view ideas is still fragmented and even marginal. Because of that the latest attempt to find soma balance between the traditions and innovations, by the most famous constructivist Alexander Wendt with his newest book "quantum Mind and Social Science" deserves through attention and analysis.

TI "QUANTUM-LIKE" THEORY OF DECISION MAKING IN POLITICAL SCIENCE

   picture of the world; decision-making theory
ID COGNITION; INTERFERENCE; MODELS; BRAIN
AB In modern political science (not only in Russia, but abroad as well) scholars are more constantly facing the question of the scientific picture of the world. It is particularly relevant under conditions of the tireless attempts to introduce natural-science methods into social sciences, to transform knowledge about socio-political processes into "positive knowledge." The article covers a new and promising direction in the decision-making theory (a sub-discipline of political science), the so-called "quantum" approach. The authors turn to this approach in order to demonstrate the heuristic potential of the "quantum-like" theory of decision-making and to push forward the discussion about the scientific picture of the world in political science as a whole. The article deals with two types of decision-making models, which are the "quantum brain" model and the "quantum consciousness" model. Categories and basic conceptual solutions of those models were proposed, in particular, by A.Yu. Khrennikov, V.I. Yukalov, J.R. Busemeyer. Despite the great opportunities that these models provide researchers with, there are a number of limitations that are also characteristic of other decision-making theories. Moreover, the authors conclude that it is necessary to depart from binary logic in the given models and to start a more frank discussion over the issues of political and socio-psychological ontology. This applies in part to the use of open quantum systems as one of the categories in the "quantum-like" theory of decision-making. The authors note that the "quantum-like" theory of decision making has great theoretical and heuristic potential, and is probably an important element in the emerging scientific picture of the world in political science.

DT Article
DE patronized goods; merit goods; market failures; paternalism; State

AB The article presents a new view of mixed economy failures and their classification in context of researching the nature and evolution of paternalism - one of the elements of the "patronized goods" theory. "Behavioral failures" add up to standard failures such as monopolies, information asymmetry externals etc. According to the theory this kind of the mixed economy failure is caused by irrational acts of individuals who choose the kind of behavior which matching the "pater's" preferences does not maximize their wellbeing. The analysis of "paternalism" is based on the approach mentioned above that made it possible to leave the habitual for this category "paternal care" of the state about its citizens and off er a more generalized interpretation of the notion. The article points to a special kind of defects of the mixed economy-"paternalistic failure" and analyzes the mechanisms of forming state paternalistic directives that cause the failure. Theoretical and applied aspects of the concept of consociational democracy are considered in the article. The concept provides for process liberalization of making political and economic decisions on the basis of developing civil society institutions and citizens' activity, aimed at reducing risks of "state failures" and wellbeing losses.

TI FROM 'FAILED STATES' TO 'STATES OF FRAGILITY': LOGIC OF CONCEPTUAL
   ACROBATICS
SO POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE statehood; failed states; fragile states; state-building; states of
   fragility; resilience; security-development nexus
AB This paper tracks the evolution and interactions of Western policy and academic discourses on statehood. With help of scientometrics it demonstrates that dynamics and trajectory of conceptualization of these terms were first framed by the end of the Cold War and later by the terrorist attacks of 9/11. However, the adoption of the first doctrinal documents on international engagement in fragile states in 2005 substantially altered the discourse. Instrumentalization of the 'fragile state' concept made it subject to a rigorous critique that revealed several drawbacks -political bias, normativity, state-centrism etc.Seeking to mitigate these limitations, scholars, experts and policymakers switched attention from 'fragile states' to 'states of fragility', elaborated multi-dimensional typology of fragility and borrowed the 'resilience' concept and a number of related terms from the theory of complex adaptive systems. These changes -influenced partly by geopolitical shifts - might help abandon outdated reductionist interpretations of state failure and de-dogmatize the discourse. Use of such concepts as 'resilience', 'stability', 'external disruptions', 'risks' favors a holistic approach to political systems which will take into account their complex interactions with the international system and the environment. However, it seems highly probable that the new concept might suffer from the same drawbacks, such as ambivalence. To avoid this risk, scholars will have to develop new techniques of measuring resilience of social systems to various kinds of disruptions, which, in turn, might help build efficient systems of early warning.

AB The essays collected in this forum discuss the geopolitical legacy of the Russian Revolution of 1917, one of the most momentous political events of the twentieth century. From a range of different academic disciplines and perspectives, the authors consider how the profound transformations in society and politics were refracted through space and geography, and how enduring these refractions proved to be. The authors focus on three themes that have been dominant in Russian affairs over the past century: 1)the problem of center-periphery relations, 2)the civilizational dynamics of Russia's self-identification in relation to Europe and to Asia, and 3)the geopolitics of national identity.

ID POLITICAL REPRESENTATION; FEDERALISM; DEMOCRACY; CONFLICT; STATE
AB The main topic of the article is analysis of institutional foundations of the ethnic federations. Special attention is paid to consideration of the two key problems: instrumental role of such federations and political representation of ethnic groups, including ethnic minorities. It is underlined that ethnic federations can play positive role and at the same time they don't exclude the risk of destabilization and separatism. From the positive side, these federations provide for ethnic groups an opportunity for realization of their right for self-determination up to creation of their own state or political autonomy within the framework of a single state. Ethnic federations also broaden the opportunities for protection of culture, language, traditions and identity of ethnic minorities. Often ethnic federations are considered as a device for settling of ethnic conflicts, overcoming of separatism and for social integration. As the international experience shows, ethnofederalism serves as a means for securing territorial integrity of states. Ethnicity itself does not have any political content but can be used for political aims. From the negative side, a political autonomy of federal subunits can be used by ethnic political elites for ethnic mobilization in order to provide their mercenary interests not rarely connected with secession. Ethnic federations are often unstable. From the contradictory interaction of two general principles of international law-territorial integrity of states and right of nations for self-determination, a necessity follows to differentiate an estimate of secession and separatism. The author criticizes those scholars who ascribe to ethnic federations shortcomings not emanating from the objective nature of those federations. For an obvious reason political representation of ethnic groups has both moral and political meaning. It provides social integration of ethnic groups and political stability of foundations of society and state. Representation is conducive to overcoming of ethnic minorities' estrangement. It is a condition for reduction of intensity of the ethnic conflict. The author shows different means for providing political representation: proportionality, parity, quota, reserving and some others.

AB The turbulence of the modern economic environment has a destructive impact on the well-being of employees. Companies are increasingly using toxic personnel/HR management practices which poison the organization's environment thus creating unfavourable working conditions for the employees. The aim of this research is to monitor and analyse the changes in labour relations and working conditions in the private sector in five countries. It also identifies those features in labour relations, which we consider to be phenomena resulting from social pollution. The research uses the questionnaire survey method, which contains closed-ended questions as well as some questions with some open-ended questions. We noted and evaluated the changes taking place in labour relations in the Czech Republic, Italy, Latvia, Pakistan, and Russia during the period 2015-2016. Based on the survey results, we argue that the factors of social pollution are indeed having a destructive impact on employees' well-being. These findings cover different categories of employees working under different socio-economic conditions. We have also identified the social pollution factors which influence the formation and spread of the precariat [i.e., proletariat under conditions of precarious working conditions] as a new social class. Monitoring, and in-depth studies carried out on these factors will enable the development of new concepts in, and techniques of, welfare management of human resources in companies and countries.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE postmodern; glocalisation; media era; post-democracy; populism;
   demagogy; plebistsitarizm; retro-nationalism; civil society;
   consultative democracy
AB The article deals with the phenomenon of modern populism, its nature and varieties in terms of the post-modern and "post-democracy" epoch (K. Krauch). These terms are: decline of party system, medialization of politics, and wide promotion of experts using the party membership. The historical roots of modern populism are analyzed, such as demagogic speech practices of tyrants in ancient policies, and structural factors, which influenced the foremost crisis of public pluralism and disintegration of middle class. The author pays particular attention to such major components of populist motions as ideology of polarization (majority vs. minority), criticism of representative institutions, and a bright leader who is able to convert mass dissatisfaction into strategy of mass-mobilization. The author underlines the enormous role of modern mass-media that are capable of influencing the majority to share politics that is not in their interest: the corresponding mass reaction turns out to be irrational. Populism is contesting all indirect forms of political action created by representative government. It seeks to clear the political arena from party activities, filling it with a meaningful narrative, which is often is a retro-nationalism. Personalization of politics is not an accident, but rather a purpose of populism, especially in the case of the strategic use of mass media as a propaganda tool. The article outlines preliminary approaches to a possible typology of populist movements. The danger of radical populism that denies pluralism is noted, due its public discrediting of political institutions. The relevant examples of manifestation of populism are analyzed, such as D. Trump's election campaign in the USA, and the activity of right populist political forces in European democracies. According to the author, it is important to take into account two kinds of requirements: increasing influence of citizens on the decision-making process and guaranteed opportunities for political participation. On this basis, new models of civic engagement, including advisory democracy, may be created, in which legislative procedures and the decision-making process will be thoroughly consulted with citizens (including online consultations), thereby generating "entry" to the political system, as well as development of expertise for the government and translation of the interests of various groups.

DT Article
DE innovation policy; the EU; framework programmes; science diplomacy
ID INNOVATION
AB This article examines the tools that the EU in interactions with third countries in the field of STI uses. The EU is a pioneer in the use of science and technology in the international arena, the creation of strategic bilateral agreements on science and technology and the conduct of political dialogues at the highest political level (at the country and regional levels). The EU actively uses its foreign policy instruments of influence, including the provision of access to its framework programs to researchers from third countries, as well as scientific diplomacy. The success of these programs and scientific diplomacy shows the effectiveness of the EU as a global actor.
   In its foreign policy global innovation strategy, the EU proceeds from the premise that no state in the world today can cope independently with modern global challenges such as climate change, migration, terrorism, etc. Therefore, the solution of these issues requires both an expert evaluation from an independent world scientific community, and the perseverance of diplomats and officials of branch ministries of national states capable of conveying the views of their government in international negotiations and defending national interests of the country to find a solution that suits everyone.
   The EU has the resources to create a "cumulative effect" by developing and applying common norms on the territory of the Union, analyzing the innovation policies of member states and the possibility of sharing best practices. At the same time, the EU shares its vision of problems, values and priorities with partners and uses the tools of "soft power" (including its smart and normative force) and scientific diplomacy in the field of STI.
   The soft power of the EU in the field of STI lies in the attractiveness of the EU as a research area in which it is possible to conduct modern high-quality international research with the involvement of scientific teams from different countries in both physical and virtual spaces. The EU training programms and expertise contribute to the development of a flexible approach in international cooperation, supported by scientific facts. On this basis practical, scientific partnerships are formed and scientific exchanges are taking place.

TI COOPERATION versus COMPETITION IN WORKS OF RUSSIAN EVOLUTIONISTS

DE evolutionary theory; competition; natural selection; Charles Darwin;
   Thomas Robert Malthus; Peter Kropotkin; cooperation; mutual aid; Russia;
   meso-level of analysis
AB One of the fundamental assumptions of mainstream economics is that competing agents maximising individual utility comprise the near totality of economic activity. However, this assumption attracts criticism because there is little experimental evidence to suggest that the competitive model is the only form of economic activity. Therefore, searches for other plausible theoretical foundations for economic activity, such as cooperation and mutual aid, are still relevant. In this connection our inquiry reintroduces a debate which occurred in Russia in the 19th and early 20thcenturies. Responses to Charles Darwin's "The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection ... " (1859) are considered, especially critiques that stress Darwin's emphasis upon competition and struggle in natural selection that can be traced to his reliance upon ideas taken directly from Thomas Robert Malthus, and that appear integrated into "Origins ... " as Chapter Three "Struggle for Existence". The historical basis of the similarity between both these British scientists' views are analysed. We consider challenging contributions made by Russian scholars about the role of cooperation and mutual aid in evolution as an alternative and additional principle to competition and it is shown that this approach has been dominant among Russian researchers, regardless of their political views and preferences. We place special emphasis upon Peter Kropotkin's focus upon cooperation and mutual aid in natural selection and evolution in his book "Mutual Aid. A Factor of Evolution" (1902). We show the relevance and prospects of this approach of Russian evolutionists. It is confirmed by the latest developments of evolutionary game theory which show the long-term instability of the individualistic Zero-determinant strategy. In conclusion, Thorstein Veblen 's connections to Peter Kropotkin are considered and the similarity in their approaches to the role of cooperation in social evolution is demonstrated.

DT Article
DE resource-type region; "bell jar"; enclave dual economy; integrated
   re-gional economy; innovative entrepreneurship; political resource;
   "institutional" entrepreneurs; "niche rent-seekers"
AB Goals and strategies characteristics of innovative entrepreneurs' behavior of Kemerovo Region and Krasnoyarsk Region as potential subjects of modernization of resource-type regions' economies are highlighted in the paper. Proposed approach is based on analysis of the relationship between specifics of the institu-tional environment of the Russian economy and types of entrepreneurs. Institution-al environment of the domestic economy is characterized by three interrelated basic parameters: political-bureaucratic market and mixed regime of property rights, enclave dual economy and regionalization. Formed institutional system modifies significantly entrepreneurs' target objectives as well as the structure of resources that are crucial for doing business and generates a variety of their types. Using matrix classification of domestic entrepreneurs built on the basis of two criteria, i.e. entrepreneurs' prevailing motivation and degree of individual political resource using, is proposed and validated in the paper. The validity of the developed matrix classification was inductively tested on the sociological research materials of developmental institutions residents in the compared resource-type regions, i.e. Kuzbass Technopark and Krasnoyarsk Regional Innovative-Technological Busi-ness Incubator. They were chosen as a subject of research as potential actors of regions' economy modernization operating outside of the privileged resource sec-tor "bell jar". The processing of the sociological research results was carried out using nonparametric criteria that allow working with small samples. The fulfilled analysis showed that innovative entrepreneurs' activities follow the logic of enclave dual economy without creating any conditions for resource-type regions transition to integrated economy development path.

It analyses the relation between the national culture and the culture of migrants and the question of integration and tolerance. The article is discussing different models of integration, which are based on different views of democracy (republican, liberal, deliberative democracy). The conclusion contains the idea, that tolerance can only be a temporary condition, which has to be exchanged by the acceptation of the exceptionality of the other, implemented into an appropriate governmental and social system.

TI REPRESENTATION OF CULTURAL TRAUMA: THE MUSEIFICATION OF THE HOLOCAUST
SO LOGOS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE cultural trauma; representation; the Holocaust Museum; memory
ID MEMORIAL MUSEUM; BERLIN
AB The article analyzes the problem of the representation of one of the greatest cultural traumas of the twentieth century - the Holocaust - in various Jewish museums (Washington, Berlin, Moscow). Although they are united by the important social function of perpetuation and edification, each museum has its own context and creates its own form of representation and rhetoric, as well as the measure of memory performance about the events of Jewish history. The concepts and exhibitions of these museums are embedded in a context of general social debate about the trauma, its principal expressibility, mediatization and visualization. The research field of trauma contains an internal contradiction. On the one hand, the field employs the psychoanalytic idea of the inexpressible injury (Theodor Adorno, Jean-Francois Lyotard, Shoshana Felman, Dori Laub, Cathy Caruth et al.), while, on the other hand, subscribing to the concept of its globalization and mediatization (Wulf Kansteiner, Ann Kaplan, Jeffrey Aleksander, Andreas Huyssen). The discourse about the Holocaust is globalized, but the memory of the Holocaust victims is functioning glocally, taking into account the specific local context of traumatic events. Consequently, the museification of the Holocaust generates a diverse field of aesthetic representations.
   The article stresses the peculiarity of these museums, such as their focus on sensual work with the past, their call for the exchange of experiences and emotions in addition to rational knowledge, their invitation to identify with the experience. In comparison to museums, it becomes evident that modern museum exhibitions and performances variably provoke the visitor to identify with the collective subject of history through a simulated experience of the suffering of others. This is impossible without emotions, sympathy and working memory. However, the therapeutically simulated traumatization through acquaintance with the phenomenon of the Holocaust is not justified in any socio-political and cultural context.

DE Russian revolution; modernization; counter-modernization;
   secularization; militant atheism; creative freedom; bureaucratization;
   industrialization; democratization; civil war; revolutionary violence;
   collectivization; Stalinism
AB Russian revolution in the broadest sense (from its prehistory in 1905-1907 to the Stalinist regime formation in the late 1920s) is considered in the context of several autonomous modernization processes (according to Randall Collins): secularization, growth of creative freedom in culture, bureaucratization, capitalist industrialization, and democratization. General links are formulated between these processes and revolutions in such aspects as the level of violence, the revolutionary success (change of power, significant concessions) or failure (when reaction wins), as well as the type of development trends of post-revolutionary regimes. True modernization usually leads to growth of economic, political and creative freedom, it strengthens a state in the aspects of resources, political and military power, prosperity and management. Russian revolutionary way was ambiguous. The Revolution led to one-sided modernization that later turned out to be counter-modernization. Initial progress after the February 1917 to democracy and collegial division of power led finally to Stalinism as one of the most brutal forms of totalitarianism. The "under-capitalist" industrialization and the Tzarist bureaucracy of the old regime were destroyed by the Revolution but then they both revived in forms of the "socialist" Stalinist industrialization and Soviet "nomenclature". These processes have strengthened the totalitarian and aggressive state of USSR with its later triumph of the victory in 1945 and formation of a superpower with several socialist satellites. However, in the aspects of secularity, creative freedom and democracy the counter-modernization occurred which caused fragility of this state success, turbulence of further development, recent slip to deindustrialization in national economy, neopatrimonialism as a decay of state bureaucracy, growth of censorship and desecularization in culture.

AB Definitions of socio-political crisis and the social revolution are given on the basis of a critical analysis of the most popular concepts by Th. Skocpol and J. Goldstone. The main stages of crisis aggravation are singled out: pacification or suppression of revolution, significant concessions to protest, overthrow of power, state breakdown and destruction of key social institutions. The typology of fields of political interaction is presented: from peaceful institutional one (legal, administrative) to the most brutal fields (open street violence, armed violence, and civil war). The transition to an open conflict is treated as a parties' choice of suppressive strategies, because previous fields of interaction and peaceful strategies have received negative reinforcement. The emerging circumstances and the course of interaction determine the main channels of conflict dynamics: the escalation of violence usually leading to victory of one party over others, resumption of peaceful strategies and unstable situation, smoldering and recurring conflict that can last for years. Typical consequences of power overthrow vary from democratization and successful development, to civil war and state breakdown, to establishment of a new authoritarianism. Differentiating conditions for these options are considered.

AB "The Crisis of representation" - a discussion that was hold from the middle of 1980 to the middle of 1990 s in social sciences, when the legitimation of the big social theories was questioned as well as the deconstruction of scientific texts and the process of knowing, based on positivistic principles, were done. In this article the author offers the analysis of intellectual context of the development of social sciences (sociology and anthropology) in the crisis. The latter are analyzed in three aspects. Firstly, the crisis concerned the process of knowing, based on principle of the unity of methods and concepts: some authors argued the influential role of language in the construction of reality. Other authors referred to implicit moral and political dimensions while the third provided deconstruction of the scholar figure and the notion of reality. In a similar vein, the crisis was articulated in the critics of scientific texts where implicit meanings and rhetorical devices were found. To the author's view, the need of reconstruction of the crisis of representation can be explained by the want of more reflexive approach to the practices of social sciences today.

DE MIKTA (Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea, Turkey, Australia); BRICS; IBSA;
   G20; integration; middle power states; emerging powers; multilateral
   international organizations
AB The papers analyses new integration initiative of the middle powers namely MIKTA (Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea, Turkey, Australia) against the background of evolution of trans-regional integration processes in Asia and Europe. The phenomenon of MIKTA is analyzed in comparison with other most successful trans-regional integration projects like G20, BRICS and IBSA (Dialogue forum of India, Brazil and South Africa). MIKTA represents a very interesting pattern of middle powers' aspiration to create multilateral international institutions which they can use to produce much stronger influence on the global politics in comparison with a simple sum of these countries' individual efforts outside the framework of such trans-regional institutions. The key question is how trans-regional integration initiatives similar to MIKTA could influence political and economic processes on the regional and macro-regional levels and whether it is possible to speak about new format of trans-regional integration models. Unlike other integration projects of middle powers MIKTA is not a formal association of different countries according to some common features (like N-11 or the Next Eleven Group or MIST/MIKT). On the contrary MIKTA represents a joint voluntary initiative for creation of multilateral trans-regional institution fostering financial, economic, political and diplomatic cooperation. For South Korea MIKTA should have become a mechanism for increasing its influence in the international organizations, Indonesia expected MIKTA to make it stronger politically and diplomatically in the world affairs, both Turkey and Mexico wanted MIKTA to perform an instrument for solving their economic problems (increase international trade volume, attract foreign investments etc.). Special political, diplomatic, trade and economical potential of MIKTA is based on the fact that its member countries claim to play a role of regional pivots which are located as bridges among various continents and geographies like Turkey (between Europe and Asia) and Mexico (between North and South America) or serve as a sort of a portal for the West to the region of Southeast Asia, specifically to its Muslim populated part, (Indonesia) and Asia-Pacific (Australia).

DE revolution; evolution; trauma; development; operation; social

AB Usually, scholarly analysis of the world/state/society proceeeds along well-known paths - revolution/evolution. This article argues that in the modern world there is such a specific phenomenon as societies of trauma. In author' opinion, these countries are for a long time stagnating and/or degraded in their development, they are in recession losing previously achieved milestones. The article discloses generic and specific features of the trauma of the society: 1) lack of precise and clear development strategy and understanding of the development prospects; 2) economic degradation; 3) lack of constructive political forces; 4) mutual transitions of power resources into capital and vice versa, capital into power resources; 5) withdrawal, both voluntary and forced, of the majority of active population from participating in political life; 6) absence of a state ideology and/or national idea; 7) ignoring national interests, or, on the contrary, their excessive absolutization; 8) a sharp increase in social inequality; 9) political strain and loss of desire for national sovereignty; 10) lack of respect for traditions and the past experience of the country or, conversely, archaism of pre-existing, gone into oblivion ethnic and religious and patriarchal attitudes. Particular attention is paid to Russia, which, so the author, can be attributed to the traumatized societies, for in its development, rejecting socialist past and proclaiming the new, like unexplored copies in its development, it is in a state of uncertainty of their future despite the broadcast official approval. And the fact that the country has not reached those milestones, in many respects depends on a strategic course, which in one way or another retains its liberal orientations. In this context, an analysis of the obstacles that have to be overcome and hamper development of Russia, and the measures that are being implemented, can not be fully attributed to either an evolutionary or a revolutionary path of development. In conclusion, the author suggests ways out from this state.

ID MULTICULTURALISM
AB The article offers an analytical picture of the ethno-cultural shifts taking place in the developed regions of the world, socio-political impact of those shifts, prospects and framework for the realization of integration potential of diversity. These topics are analyzed from the standpoint of the identity approach in the context of theories of conflict and contact and using microdata of the European Social Survey. It is shown that global migration increases ethnic and cultural heterogeneity of host societies which is becoming more and more a powerful factor of the decline of trust, cohesion and stability of these societies. The migration crisis in the EU has increased the threat of translating the ethno-cultural contradictions into a destructive conflict of identities. Meanwhile following the logic of migration processes and their effects development, the transient nature of the escalation of intercultural confrontation may be assumed. The factors facilitating positive interethnic interaction are identified. The article provides examples of diversity contributing to the alleviation of intercultural tensions and transformation of the divided communities into social organisms operating as "E Pluribus Unum". The realization of the positive potential of diversity requires an efficient model of intercultural relations based on the recognition of the existence of ethnic and other differences within society and focused on finding the foundations for the rapprochement of cultures which is different from multiculturalism and assimilation. Given that as omniculturalism, emphasizing the commonality of human nature, and polyculturalism, representing cultures and nations as a product of overlapping histories of different ethnic and racial groups and their relationships, could generate contradictory effects, interculturalism seems to be more promising. This approach is focused on searching common interests of people and stimulating an intercultural dialog from below. Though intercultural initiatives are not numerous, they have already given a good account, requiring the search of instruments of practical implementation of such practices at the subnational and especially national levels.

DT Article
DE conflict nature; mutual images; messianic concepts; misunderstanding;
   different political models; reliance on personal contact; rivalry;
   transformation of the World Order
AB In the article, the author reflects on the conflict nature of Russia-U.S. relations. Through the years, the interaction between these two leading powers is balancing between two poles: confrontation and friendship. Only two models of relations exist: the model of hope and the model of disappointment, which follow each other as the day follows the night. Why it is so difficult for these states to build a strong and stable partnership? The author supposes that besides the absence of a firm economic base there are cultural and psychological roots that go up to the national identity of both countries, their competitive visions of self-greatness and self-exclusiveness, and their special missions in the world. Along with these two rather close self-visions, there are two different visions of the counterpart. The image of Russia in the United States is that of "Stranger". In different periods, Russia has been perceived in the U.S. in various ways, in particular, as an enemy during the Cold War. However, even in the World War II when the two countries were allies, USSR was still a "Stranger". A "Stranger" means a country, which is difficult to understand, which is too different to be attractive, and finally, which arouses suspicion and anxiety. For Russia, the United States is "The Other" - the alter ego, the one who can be both an example and a scapegoat. Unfortunately, these two different images - "The Stranger" and "The Other" - are very easy to be transformed into one - "The Enemy". The mismatched perceptions of each other, effectively used by political elites to create negative or even aggressive context, underlie mutual misunderstanding and mistrust that dominate bilateral relations both at the governmental and societal level. When it comes to conflict, this misunderstanding easily evolves into an unwillingness to understand, full emotional and psychological closeness and alienation, which inevitably sharpens every confrontation. The mismatched images together with different political models, also analyzed by the author, and a rivalry for the international influence, make the conflict in the U.S. - Russia relations inevitable. Meanwhile, the modern international reality itself, full of challenges and threats, could be a cure to this perpetual conflict.

DE Index of Economic Freedom; human rights; subject of freedom; population;
   quantity analysis
AB The paper is aimed to demonstrate that annual Index of Economic Freedom actually describes not only country's economic freedom level but also levels of other kinds of freedom. Analysis of Index components shows that most of them are dependent of civic and political freedom. And some components require social and cultural human rights to be treated well. Thus the Index may be used for comprehensive evaluation of freedom level in a country. The correlation between Index of Economic Freedom and other social, economic and political indexes is proved by Index's authors and by the author of the paper. The greater economic freedom is correlated to higher per capita incomes and overall wellbeing, including such factors as health, education, innovation and democratic governance. Nevertheless there is some fuzziness in the index conception. Economists, journalists and other experts pointed out that above said correlations are not valid and that Index's authors had overestimated benefits of free market and idealized libertarian ideas. Sure enough that it is hard to confirm the statement of Index's authors that the global economic freedom has been rising since 1995. Methodology and the set of examined countries have been changing all the time. Understanding economic freedom as an attribute of a human being (not of a state) leads to taking population size into account. So it is proved in the paper that comparative analysis of Indexes between the nations should be based on population data. This approach shows that economic freedom is not so widely spread as the authors of 2017 Report claim. Although 51% of the world countries may be called "economically free", there are only 31% of world population living in these countries. More than 2/3 of the people live in "economically unfree" countries. At the same time taking population size into account rises correlation coefficient between Index of Economic Freedom and GDP (PPP) per capita from 0,61 to 0,74 demonstrating strong correlation between human income and economic freedom.

AB From 2005 to 2011, the Bulgarian police force collected donations exceeding $90 million from a host of individuals, corporations, foreign governments, persons undergoing criminal investigations, and convicts. After condemnation both domestically and internationally, the practice became completely illegal in 2013. Nevertheless, in 2015, the government lifted the donation prohibition, allowing foreign governments and international and state organizations to donate to the Interior Ministry. Differentiating between utilitarian and moral models of corporate social responsibility is important, since genuine donors create higher value through their prosocial deeds than self-interested ones. Given Bulgaria's excessive spending on public order and the ambiguous nature of donations to public servants, we seek to understand the corporate motivations for donating to the police. To address this question, we draw upon theories of corporate philanthropy, social exchange, and entrepreneurial orientation and use unique face-to-face interview data from 2011 to 2013 with police officers and businesspeople. Our qualitative findings point to multifaceted drivers of philanthropy beyond those considered in the dominant strategic-instrumental perspective. We argue that donations to the police can be an expression of business executives' altruistic values, a desire to forge strategic alliances, enhance status in social hierarchies, a form of political reconciliation, or a protection payment. Lastly, we present descriptive statistics of money donated to the Interior Ministry, discuss the potential socioeconomic consequences, and propose policies to reduce police reliance on private financing.

DT Article
DE Sweden; immigration; asylum seekers; multiculturalism; interculturalism;
   integration
AB For many decades, Sweden was firmly committed to the open doors policy towards immigration. Until the 1990s the immigration had come mostly from Christian countries and favoured economic performance due to its mainly labour nature. Afterwards the asylum seekers from the Middle East and Africa have become prevailing in its structure. Therefore, mostly labour migration was replaced by mostly asylum migration. Sweden received a record 163,000 asylum seekers in 2015. That was the highest per-capita rate in Europe. Processing and supporting such large numbers of migrants is costly for the state budget. Besides the fact that the integration of Muslims has turned out to be immensely difficult, an increasing criminality in the society has been observed. The theory and practice of multiculturalism are now considered as unsuccessful. The riots in Rinkeby (2010, 2013 and 2017) as well as in other predominantly migrant-populated suburbs and, at last, the terrorist attack performed by an Uzbekistan native in Stockholm on April 7, 2017 when four people were killed, manifested the failure of multiculturalism. The migrant problem has come to the fore, sparked new disagreements and an unprecedented for the last decades discord in the Swedish society. Along with this, a search for a new integration model for people with diverse cultural backgrounds has been intensified. The Swedes' general attitude to immigrants is considered to be the most benevolent in Europe. However, since 2015 it has worsened. And what is especially important is that the analysis of the Swedes' stance on specific issues of immigration uncovers their much more critical relation to it. It means that the government immigration policy has to be restricted. Otherwise, the electoral influence of the right populist Sweden Democrats' party will keep rising which is fraught with serious social and political perturbations.

AB Values and elements of popular culture play an important role in shaping and implementing the foreign policy of Iran. In this paper, using content analysis and after explaining the characteristics of Iranian identity, the author seeks to investigate the implications of Iranian social beliefs on foreign policy. In other words, the author sets out to explore whether the perceptions and attitudes of Iranian identity at different historical periods have been the basis according to which Iranian politicians have followed the same model or not? For this purpose, three major components, the influence in the regional area, xenophobia, and conspiracy theory that are complementary in nature, have been selected. Research findings illustrate that the long history of societies like Iran has been the raison d'etre for the recurrence of social beliefs and values in various political eras of such societies.

AB With the imposition of reciprocal Russia-EU sanctions, Italy faced a challenging choice. On the one hand, the country was expected to consistently carry out the common European policy ( especially in the light of the Italian 2014 EU presidency during the evolving crisis in Ukraine). On the other hand, Italy was interested in protecting its national interests, which were affected by the sanctions. The divisions over the sanctions impacted the results of different votes. The article presents the analysis of the voting among the political parties on parliamentarian resolutions, related to 2012-2016 anti-Russian sanctions (voting in the European Parliament and in the Chamber of Deputies). The findings of the research show that the ruling Democratic party has been supporting anti-Russian policies at the European and national levels. Its major opponents "Lega Nord" and "Five Star Movement" are advocates of lifting or easing the sanctions. The party "Forza Italia" tends to be inconsistent and dependent on the political fluctuations.

AB The current efforts of Moscow and Tokyo to unblock the territorial impasse are complicated by some barriers of a socio-psychological character, including mutual mistrust and contradictory images of past events. Public opinion surveys reveal predominant vectors in Russo-Japanese relations, which the authors believe strongly correlate with the evolution of the contradictory images. Apparently, these images surprisingly exhibit interrelated mirror' dynamics connected with the independent variable - events happening in bilateral relations. Apparently, these images surprisingly exhibit interrelated mirror' dynamics connected with the independent variable - events happening in bilateral relations. The authors also investigate how public opinion has a real impact on politics and relations between states. In the authors' opinion, Russia and Japan definitely do not have major unresolved problems in their bilateral relations, with the exception of the territorial problem. However, why is the public so suspicious of Russia? Can the territorial dispute be the only reason? It is far from that. The analyzed arguments give grounds to believe that it is very difficult for Japan and Russia to find a mutually acceptable solution, as their relations are not free from suspicion and mutual mistrust which are deeply rooted in the history of their relations. It will be much easier to overcome the mistrust and, accordingly, to reach agreement on the territorial issue when they manage to calmly analyze the historical grudges, understand their nature and origin, and realize that this is history, which has no contemporary value.

DE Neo-Kantianism; philosophy of history; dialectics; socialism; axiology
AB This paper is devoted to analyses of the context of Sergius Hessen's political philosophy and philosophy of law. Sergius Hessen is known as a participant of Russian Neo-Kantian philosophy. The framework of Hessen's philosophy has raised from Southwest Neo-Kantian school's axiology. Hessen has used comparison of Neo-Kantian value and fact in his significant works. Essential terms of themselves political and social philosophy (like notions of "tradition" and the "purpose-task") influenced of Rickert's culture philosophy. Development of culture had presented as process of deploying values. This approach to actualization of cultural and historic data like a continuity of implementation of values is the essential principle of Hessen's philosophy of history.
   Dialectics is a crucial concept for clarify comprehension of social progress Hessen's. He supposed, that dialectical method of Hegel is the medium to depiction of continuously of social progress. Russian Neo-Kantian thinker has used Hegel's dialectical triad (from abstract via negative to concrete) for explain the process of development of socialism and the legal state. He defined three steps of developing of socialism: level of abstractive negation of liberalism, level of concrete negation of liberalism, and level of assertoric negation of liberalism.
   Sergius Hessen recognized social progress as dialectical process; he shared Hegel's meaning to contradiction and negation as principles of actualization of value's condition in reality. This decision helps him to show evolution of idea of freedom. One of the main criteria of freedom development is extension of realm of personal rights. Thereby Hessen has used dialectics of Hegel's philosophy for structuration of own philosophy of history and philosophy of law.
   Summing up, this paper proves, that progress of culture in Hessen's philosophy is a process of deploying condition of values (in the sense of Southwest Neo-Kantian's philosophy), which occurs in pattern of triad of dialectics of Hegel.

AB Using data from a nearly comprehensive set of the world's electoral democracies, 1992-2014, this article empirically evaluates the impact of presidentialism upon legislative fragmentation. The analysis demonstrates that the impact is strong, consistent across a wide variety of political contexts, and conditioned by the type of presidential regime, the scope of presidential powers, electoral system effects, and essential party system properties. While much of the reasoning regarding the interplay between presidentialism and legislative fragmentation has been traditionally focused on short-term coattail effects of presidential elections, this study shows that these effects are real, but they are insufficient to make a significant impact upon the parameter of crucial importance for the functioning of presidential regimes: the number of parties in the legislature. The main impact of presidentialism is systemic, stemming from its tendency to restrict the number of parties to a limited set of viable competitors for the presidential prize.

   Optics of Critical Ecology
SO MIR ROSSII-UNIVERSE OF RUSSIA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE professionalism; sociology of professions; critical ecology of
   professions; Russian history
ID PERSPECTIVES; WORLD
AB This article presents a critical ecology of professions as a new theoretical and methodological perspective on the understanding professionalism in sociology. The article first considers this approach with respect to the main areas of research in the sociology of professions. Then the analytical possibilities of this approach are demonstrated by applying it to studies of the history of the development of professions in Russia from the 18th century to the end of the Soviet period. Attention is paid to the institutional, cultural, economic and social factors which shape the environment of professionalism in Russia. The authors consider professionalism as a changing, multi-layered and multi-faceted phenomenon, analysing the pre-socialist and state-socialist periods of the formation of occupations and process of professionalization in Russia. The retrospective study of Russian and Soviet professionalism shows how different occupations have responded to the numerous, dramatic changes in economic, social and political life. Professions were either moving toward the centre of the changes, or were adapting, taking certain ecological niches. The article shows that professional employment went through a long development, including reforms, revolutions, wars, political purges, and economic and social modernization. Being dependent on the state, the professionals of the Russian empire sought to achieve some autonomy and to widen opportunities for self-regulation. The Soviet state created a new map of occupations, destroying or "reforging" old professional groups. Official propaganda glorified the feats of labour and the professionalism of blue collar workers, doctors and teachers, while suppressing or inhibiting some other professional groups. Professional knowledge and skills formed the basis of the mutual solidarity of professionals. The internal values, norms and concepts developed informally in daily working practices and relationships with employees and customers, became the basis of the rules of conduct and the boundaries of collective identity. These symbolic elements formed the core of professionalism as a value system and ideology in social historic environment. At the same time throughout the period under consideration, the collective identity of various professions was formed in close conjunction with the state apparatus. The government attempted to rationalize the everchanging mechanisms of the division of labour in different sectors and industries.

TI TRUMP FACTOR IN RUSSIA - US RELATIONS

LA Russian
DT Article
DE international relations; populism; USA; Trump; nuclear arms control;
   crisis; Cold War; bipolarity
AB The article deals with Donald Trump's ascent to the White House that may open a new phase in the international relations, and foremost in relations between Russia and the USA. This is determined by the very Trump phenomenon, which is neither accidental, nor confined exclusively to the American politics, but reflects deep changes in the life of many nations and world environment as a whole. Donald Trump is a product of the world's anti-globalist trend - populism. That is why he remains for the time being one of the most unpredictable politicians. Russian leadership obviously gave preference to Trump during the US election campaign. The main reason of such attitude of the Russian elite towards Trump was his political line of rejecting foreign policy of President Barak Obama, under whom Russian-American relations sank to the lowest point since the end of the Cold War. In order to estimate the possibility of substantial improvement under Trump it is worthwhile once again to address the reasons of the crisis of the recent few years in the relations between the two powers with the purpose of understanding how probable the removal of these reasons in the future. In view of the domestic political situation in the USA and spontaneous nature of Trump's pre-election declarations, it is still not clear which policy course will be implemented by his administration, if and when it elaborates a consistent foreign policy. This is not the whole present uncertainty, however. No less unpredictable are the changes in Russian policy in reaction to what is happening within the United States and if the changes happen - which direction they will take. Moreover, in the situation of domestic political chaos and actual paralysis of state authority in the United States, the future of the relations between the two powers depends presently more on Russia, its ability to quickly adapt to the changing situation and come out with big, concrete initiatives aimed at directing its dynamics to a constructive channel.

AB We employ a political ambition framework to study women's under-representation in Russian local politics. We conduct a survey of current heads of municipal districts and municipal urban and rural settlements in four regions of the Russian Federation. The study reveals gendered pathways to local leadership positions. The advantage of incumbency is fully used by male politicians: male incumbents are more likely than female incumbents to run for re-election. Self-initiated ambition, term in office, and age explain the decisions of male executives to run for re-election. Female incumbents are likely to run for a subsequent term only if they are supported by the United Russia Party.

   ASSOCIATION
LA Russian
DT Article
DE rationality; model of man; classical political economy; marginal
   revolution; behavioral economics
AB The article deals with evolution of rationality assumption as component of the model of man in economic science. In classical political economy this assumption didn't play the key role separating the scope of economic science - this role was performed by the assumption of self-interest. The rationality assumption became important as a result of the Marginal revolution and began to be an object of special research only in the context of expected utility maximization hypothesis of von Neuman and Morgenstern. These developments made it remote from everyday human behavior. In order to make economics a bit more realistic various strategies are used which are briefly surveyed. Within the constant rationality approach we could choose a model of a representative agent characterized by full or bounded rationality. Within the variable rationality approach an additional economic agent may be introduced who will be responsible for observed deviations from rational behaviour, while all the other agents could be described by the familiar rational model. The second variant consists in splitting the economic agent into different subpersonalities, having different, and moreover, conflicting goals. Still another option is to make rationality not only variable but also continuous. In this case it is possible to reach the optimal rationality which differs from the maximum one.

AB Gender inequality is still an important and frequently discussed problem both in everyday life and science. Its source and genesis were clearly identified by different variation of feminist theory, but the solution, which was able to change all sides of gender relation, wasn't find. The classical feminism was involved into making decisions with regard to political, legal and economic problems of the females, but could not change `man's mind'. Postmodern feminists as a phenomenon do not exist for mass consciousness and doesn't influences everyday life of modern Russian society.

AB The article presents a discussion of Russian leading experts (sociologists, political scientists, economists) about modern Russian society and its development prospects. Events in recent years (the reunification of the Crimea, complication of relations of the Russian Federation with the Western countries, sanctions and countrsanctions, economic crisis, change of US political leader and so on) not only changed the political and social context, but also caused a change in social expectations of the population. Research of Institute of Sociology RAS in 2016 showed an increasingly anxious mood of Russia, but assessment of the situation in the country is far from disastrous. Experts discuss not only reasons for this phenomenon, but also the possibility of a political crisis. An attempt is made to determine in which direction in the coming years the political regime in modern Russia will be transformed. Against a background of new challenges and threats that Russia might face in the next 5-10 years. Analyzed economic and political trends can lead Russia to a new qualitative state. Experts have concluded that Russian society today is stable, but the lack of the strategic vision of the future can lead to dramatic consequences.

His name is associated with the St Petersburg University, where he held the Department of Statistics and was dean of the Faculty of History and Philology. He made a significant contribution to the formation and development of statistics in Russia as a science, and also took an active part in the development of Russian state statistics, leading in 1811 the Statistical Office under the Ministry of Police. Thanks to the work of Herman, there was a departure in the statistics from classical state studies (the German descriptive school), a close interconnection of statistics and political economy was shown. Through the works of Herman, new and progressive ideas from the West penetrated into Russia, as evidenced by the publication of the "Statistical Journal" (1806-1808).

AB The article is devoted to the scholarly creativity of the professor of St. Petersburg State University Yury Georgievich Alekseev (1926-2017). Being the apprentice of the well-known Soviet historian I. I. Smirnov, Alekseev became one of the brightest representatives of the St. Petersburg (Leningrad) School of historians - a famous scholar, remarkable lecturer and promoter of historical science. Among his scientific interests one can find the problems of the social, economic and political history of ancient and medieval Russia, the history of Russian legislation, agrarian history, military history, the history of the Navy. The article analyses the work of Yu. G. Alekseev in the connection with the development of the domestic historical science of the 20th and the beginning of the 21 centuries. Alekseev devoted his books and articles to the agrarian history of Russia, the era of Ivan III and monuments of Russian medieval legislation. In recent years he paid particular attention to the problems of Russia's military history. All his monographs are closely linked with one another, and all together dedicated to the formation and development of the Russian State. The authors of the article attentively analyze the works of Yu. G. Alekseev, paying close attention to his thorough and subtle work with sources and in-depth knowledge of historiography. The authors compare Alekseev's views on the evolution of the socio-economic relations in medieval Russia with I. Ya. Froyanov's conception of community conception and simultaneously show the connection of these views with the legacy of N. P. Pavlov-Silvansky. Along with other historians of the peasantry, among whom are N. E. Nosov, A. I. Kopanev, I. Ya. Froyanov, A. L. Shapiro, and D. I. Raskin, Alekseev created new theory of the development of Russian peasantry and community during 15th and 16th centuries. A main theoretical conclusion of Alekseev is his conceptualization of the medieval Russian state as so called zemsko-sluzhiloie (land-service) State. This theory is a valuable contribution to scholarship. Also of value are his works on the history of national legislation. One can say that his works about the Pskov Judicial Act, Laws of Ivan III, statutory diplomas, his book devoted to the shaping of the Russian administration are the 'gold standard of national historical scholar'. His contribution to the study of Russia's medieval military history is multifarious. Alekseev studied the campaigns of Russian troops under the rule of Ivan III and could reveal the large-scale reforms of the Organization of the Office of the military business in Russia of the 15th and 16th centuries, particularly, a qualitatively new level of command of the troops. The military victories of Ivan III, the liberation of Russia from the horde's dependency and the creation of a single State - all these achievements were the result of the above-mentioned great reforms.

DE turn to archaism; globalization; modernization; values; institutions;

AB The turn to archaism in contemporary political development has been at the centre of recent debates in Dostoyevsky Library in Moscow, forming part of the Rejoinders. in a dialogue series. It seems that the enthusiastic interest for the effects of globalization is being succeeded by the dominance of a new traditionalism. If in the past archaism in politics manifested itself mostly at local level, today it is becoming a universal phenomenon, which is due to to both intrinsic and global factors, such as the crisis of the Western model of modernization. What drives this tendency and where is it leading? Does it unavoidably result in political conflicts or, on the contrary, could it help to open new forms of intercultural dialogue and understanding? Is it right to equate 'Global' and 'Western' in politics? What is common and what is specific in the process of restoring 'traditional values' in the West, in Russia, and in such countries as. Iran and India? What are the main distinguishing indicators of modernism and archaism in politics? Participants in the discussion, while observing the parallels between the archaist trend in today's Eastern countries and the Old Believers movement in 17th-20th century Russia, on the one hand, and between the European Reformation and the reformative processes outside the borders of the Christian world, on the other hand, agreed that the question, how the new rise of traditionalism should be dealt with, can be answered in three possible ways. The first way is to treat tradition as a museum artifact, to use it for legitimation of obsolete political relations. The second, 'post-modern' approach implies. a deep disappointment with. tradition and total. rejection of any connections with past. The third way, promoted by scholars participating in the present dialogue, is to make use of the tradition as a starting point for new modernizing efforts and the basis for promoting intercultural understanding.

AB The first post-war decades for West Germany were marked by a rapid economic recovery, which, despite the devastating catastrophe of the Second World War and the ensuing split of the state, quickly returned the country to the number of highly developed industrial nations of the world. The monetary and economic reforms carried out in 1948 made it possible not only to lay the foundations of monetary and financial stability, to increase incentives for the growth of entrepreneurial activity and labor productivity, but also to create conditions for carrying out the economic policy (Ordnungspolitik) of the Social market economy. Based on the idea of building a free, efficient and at the same time socially fair market system, the concept of a Social market economy succeeded in filling the institutional vacuum of the post-war period, gaining wide recognition of German voters and becoming the fundamental constituent element of the social and economic system of Germany. Thanks to the high GDP growth rates achieved in the 1950s and 1960s, the Western Germans were able to quickly overcome post-war disruption, cope with unemployment, substantially raise the standard of living of broad sections of the population and ensure a high level of economic, social and political stability in the long term.
   The authors analyze the formation of the ideational foundations of the Social market economy in Germany - a concept which theoretical framework is based on various streams of socio-economic and legal thought. First, we will draw the attention on the fundamental principles of German ordoliberal economic thought, principles that directly influenced the formation of the doctrine of a new social and economic system in post-war West Germany. After that, we will highlight the most important aspects that define the social foundation of a Social market economy - the concept of a policy of order in the first decades of the existence of the Federal Republic of Germany. Then we will transfer these reflections to the modern theory of order in order to determine the place and role of social policy in the current socio-economic system of the Federal Republic. In conclusion, some propositions concerning the importance of the policy of order in the structure of modern economic science will be formulated.

DE adaptation; children of Muslim migrants (Muslim migrant children);
   Republic of Tatarstan; intercultural dialogue; multicultural training of
   the teacher
AB Activization of migratory processes led to increase in number of Muslim migrant children in educational institutions. Migrant children have a language barrier in communication with peers, difficulties with adaptation to new culture, new traditions, customs, value orientations, new relations in group. And a result is negative experience of training and high trait anxiety. Concerning children's age migrants studying is actual sociocultural, language, psychological and pedagogical aspects of adaptation. It should be noted that the problem of migrant children adaptation is rather well investigated. Models of migrant children' and their families' adaptation were created taking into account sociocultural features of different countries and regions, methods of language adaptation of children. Extensive date of empirical researches was collected; the system of monitoring was developed. At the same time researches of a problem of multicultural training of the teacher are at an origin stage. In this area there are no complete fundamental researches in the world science yet.
   Research objectives: to study by experiment adaptation of Muslim migrant children in the Republic of Tatarstan, justification of idea of intercultural dialogue as principle of multicultural training of the teacher for work with children of Muslim migrants. Method: To detect adaptation features of Muslim migrant children and their families in the receiving community we prepared two questionnaires. The first questionnaire was directed to detection of difficulties, which Muslim migrant children faced in the course of training. The second questionnaire included questions for identification the problems, which teachers had in work with Muslim migrant children. 150 elementary school teachers, 120 Muslim migrant children and their parents took part in research. Examinees were from Kazan, from the towns and the villages in the Republic of Tatarstan. Primary results processing revealed lack of negative attitude to Muslim migrant children at public school. Some children and parents told about existence of misunderstanding and the conflicts with certain teachers. Most of the parents noted absence of conditions at schools for Muslim ceremonies (Mohammedan prayer), the requirement of school uniform, lack of "halal" food, joint stay of girls and boys at physical education classes.
   Questioning of teachers showed that at public schools in the Republic of Tatarstan the number of migrant children was few; the overwhelming majority of migrant children are from Muslim families. The most actual problems which teachers face in the course of training and education of Muslim migrant children are: a language barrier, problems in learning of Russian grammar, ignorance of the child's customs of native culture, ignorance of culture of the host country. The analysis of questioning results also revealed that most of migrants were from low social groups. They had no opportunity to get good education, to join in refinement. Ignorance and lack of education of most migrants as a result generates social provocations, religious-based conflicts, manifestations of extremism, etc. In such conditions there is a need for special training of the teacher based on conceptual idea of intercultural dialogue.
   The principle of the intercultural dialogue is understood in science as interaction, influence, insight of different historical or modern cultures, as forms of their confessional or political coexistence. The Republic of Tatarstan in this regard is the unique region. Here for a long time both ethnic Muslim Tatars and representatives of other nationalities and religions live in friendship and chime. The scientific and educational project "Multicultural Training of the Teacher" is developing at the Kazan federal university at that moment. The project has complex interdisciplinary character and is directed to training of teachers for work with Muslim migrant children and their families. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The article analyzes the essence, location, status, and role of the informal BRICS grouping. The authors examine and compare the different points of view on this phenomenon and believe that the comparative and economical approaches that dominate in the contemporary studies of the BRICS are unproductive. While member countries of the Association are experiencing economic slowdown or recession, BRICS is gradually becoming a political phenomenon of the global world. BRICS is considered the center of an impact of the regional leaders on three continents. A specific model of communication of the member countries of the BRICS and their partners is polylogue as one of the methods to solve the problem of equitable participation of all countries of the global world in the process of global governance. In the geopolitical framework of the BRICS and their partners, it is the formation of an extra-American zone of interaction, which will gradually evolve into a Global nonWestern project..

DE civilization approach; social inertia; path dependency; civilizational
   core; civilizational track; civilizational trap; social resources;
   geographical and geopolitical factors; Orthodoxy; mentality; historical
   memory
AB This article deals with a number of topics raised in the two monographs "Russia as a Civilization" and "Is New Russia New?". It clarifies the categorical apparatus which allows the integration of the civilizational approach and path dependency. An important problem with the civilizational approach is rooted in its origin: the approach was first developed within the framework of the philosophy of history, the methodology of which is not sensitive to empirical details. Later the popularity of this approach led to its transmigration into more exact disciplines - history, including economic history, and sociology. However, the shift in the subject field was not supported by the adequate development of a particular scientific methodology. As a result, the question of Russia's place in the system of local civilizations remains more a matter of faith, and none of the contending parties are able to supply arguments that can convince their opponents.
   The main drawback of existing civilizational studies is their voluntary treatment of historical data: countries are often contemporaneously compared regardless of the fact that they may be going through different stages of development, analogies are often drawn arbitrarily in order to fit into the deductive logic, and the facts are generally cherry picked to justify chosen theoretical concepts. Not surprisingly, despite its long history, civilizational analysis in Russia still remains more integrated into ideological, rather than scientific discourse. On the other hand, the concept of path dependency, which originated in the economic sciences, is much more accurate and specific, yet precisely for this reason it struggles to explain the dynamics of history over the scale of a thousand years.
   In this paper I propose two sets of categories which may be helpful for integrating the civilizational approach and path dependency. The first set of categories pertains to the analysis of the mechanisms of historical continuity within a single civilization: 1) a civilizational core as a set of factors acting throughout a civilization's history; 2) a historical track as a real trajectory in the context of available resources; 3) civilizational traps (often political) as specific developments that lead to irreversible consequences. The second set of categories distinguishes between different domains of historical continuity such as geography, geopolitics, politics, religion, the history of ownership relations and historical memory. I argue that such a categorical grid allows for the proper empirical testing of hypotheses often drawn from civilizational analysis.

AB This article provides an examination of the role of experts in the Russian budget process. Experts are those whose role is based on specialised knowledge and technical skills, rather than affiliation to an agency, association or political party. Ideally their contributions are impartial. In the first part of the article the channels of expert influence are described, primarily within the executive branch. Features are found in these channels that mean that impartial advice is not always guaranteed. In the second part, on the basis of a survey of experts, the answers to two questions are sought: whether they feel that impartial advice is expected of them and whether they provide it. There are negative elements in the responses on both counts, suggesting that despite some evidence of demand for such advice on the part of policy-makers, expert advice is often not impartial.

DT Article
DE Spain; People's Party; Spanish Socialist Workers' Party; Podemos;
   Ciudadanos; Indignant Movement; parliamentary elections; electorate
AB The Spanish party system experienced a radical transformation over the years of global crisis. Bipartidism has been dominating in political life for about 30 years. Two political parties - center-left Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) and the People's Party (PP) replaced each other in power significantly outrunning all other parties in the extent of influence. The existing practice helped to maintain the societal stability and governability. The trend has changed in the latest years as the cumulative potential of both parties has decreased. The December 2015 parliamentary elections were an electoral "earthquake". Both parties received 50.7% of the vote, what was one third less than in 2011 (74.3%). A crisis of confidence in political parties is revealed no only through electoral evaluation of their policies. A substantial societal protest potential accumulated in the country and was expressed by two new political parties - Podemos and Ciudadanos - which over a short period of time have noticeably surpassed the PP and PSOE ending the bipartidism. At the same time, the vices of all parties are often reproduced in the performance of the new ones. For example, Podemos claiming the intention to avoid bureaucratism turns into a centralized party resembling the Caudillo-style party traditional for Spain. After December 2015 elections, the balance of forces was such that the formation of a new government was impossible without an agreement between four main parties. Since party leaders prioritized narrow party interests, ambitions and electoral calculations over the national ones, they failed to form the government. The June 2016 extraordinary elections were the result. The minority government of the Popular Party was formed only after the elections. It became possible due to the change of the PSOE stance, which used to be in firm opposition but abstained in a confidence vote to PP leader Mariano Rajoy. PSOE itself faced an acute crisis. The change from the two-party system to a multiparty one leads to a radical change in the format and rhetoric of the Spanish politics. An insufficiently developed culture of dialogue and compromise becomes an imperative for societal governability. All politicians despite their ideological and political orientations have to withstand a serious psychological test, learn to survive in new conditions and agree with each other. The time of political turmoil has come to Spain. Real multiparty system is better adapted to the country's difficult and dynamic reality. But it increases multiple political risks and makes development prospects less certain and predictable.

AB The article is a reflection on the paper of T.A. Alexeyeva (The Debates about "Great Debates." How to Structure the Theory of International Relations - Polis. Political Studies. 2016. No. 6. P. 9-21 (In Russ)). The questions raised by T.A. Alekseeva help to understand the origins of ideological and methodological crisis in international relations theory (IRT), which began 25-30 years ago, and has not been overcome until now. The authors emphasize that T.A. Alekseeva, standing on the position of social constructivism, shifts the discussion of the "Great Debates" to the sphere of discourse analysis in the framework of the IRT. Authors agreed with T.A. Alexeyeva in some conclusions: there are different points of view on the periodization and the content of the debate; the debate was sometimes held with some generalized set of ideas, rather than with specific scientists; the use of the "Great Debates" for the periodization of the evolution of IRT does not fully cover the diversity observed in its evolution. At the same time, the authors objected to the statement of T.A. Alekseeva, that the "Great Debates" are just a myth or some kind of half-truth, which reflects some aspects of corresponding discourse. The authors suggest a counter-statement by elaborating their own position in the questions of the IRT history and its evolution as a discipline, according to which the utility of constructivist approach is put into question.

TI MAJESTY AND TRAGEDY OF THE SOVIET "EXPERIMENT"
SO POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE democracy; authoritarianism; Soviets; statehood; antinomic character of
   the Soviet system; democratism of "common cause"; Russian reformation
AB Almost a century has passed since the events of October 1917, which encourages us to estimate "from a distance" the Soviet experience born by the Russian revolution. The Soviet system emerged at a crisis stage of development of industrial society in the capitalist guise. In Russia, where contradictions of violently developing capitalism were tangled in Gordian knot with semi-feudal archaic, an alternative of development emerged, perceived by Bolsheviks as "socialism" and "dictatorship of proletariat". The independent organizations that spontaneously grew up "from bottom" - the Soviets of Workers' and Peasants' Deputies - appeared as an original form of "downstream" democracy. Their ambivalent symbiosis with the authoritarian "party of a new type" formed the Soviet statehood. The antinomic ambiguity of the Soviet system is a thread that runs through the entire history of the Soviet Union, defining duality of the Soviet experience' estimation. On the one hand, there is greatness in people's deed - the transformation, which presented an alternative to capitalist alienation and which forced capitalism to social modification. On the other hand, there are authoritarian trends of Soviet power, which resulted in a totalitarian canalization of the revolutionary enthusiasm, while the energy of mass creativeness was strangled in clutches of the ideological myths and political repressions. The Soviet experience is appealing because it embodies the mass solidarity around "the common cause" of creating a new society free from exploitation. This great idea captured mass consciousness and prompted people to "storm the heaven" in spite of regime's despotism. It is a complicated question whether it was possible to reform the Soviet system, while saving its best traditions. However, a quarter of a century after the collapse of the USSR, the Soviet legacy hasn't been neglected: there is still a crave for a greater "common cause" in Russian transforming society, and the Russian reformation is far from over.

TI Royal-Dutch Shell in Russia and Western Sanctions
SO VESTNIK MEZHDUNARODNYKH ORGANIZATSII-INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS
   RESEARCH JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE transnational corporations; sanctions; Royal Dutch Shell; Gazprom;
   international cooperation; energy
AB This article reports on research based on three crucial aspects of the current global economic situation. First is the role of transnational corporations (TNCs) in establishing and constructing international cooperation at the supranational level. Second is the policy of sanctions against Russia in connection with the situation in Ukraine. And third is the cooperation of Royal Dutch Shell with Russia's Gazprom despite the political, economic and technological sanctions imposed on Russian companies and economic sectors.
   Analyzing Shell's policy on the Russian energy market should reveal some kind of the managing principle that not only Shell but most TNCs follow in taking the political atmosphere into consideration, while striving to avoid any related restrictions.
   The research methodology uses analytical, ultimate analysis and functional methods. The analytical method helped to lay the theoretical foundation of the research. Modern TNCs are deeply engaged in the process of economic globalization. To expand their influence, such companies create economic conditions for organizing international production with local markets and for international markets for capital, labour, and scientific and consulting services. The ultimate analysis method revealed the following pattern: in struggling for the global market, TNCs raise the level of competition, which creates a permanent need for technical innovations and scientific progress. The functional analysis method demonstrated a casual relationship in modern economic development: by assisting capital turnover and labour and transport mobility, TNCs contribute significantly to economic growth and development.
   The first part of the article focuses on the history and methodology of the genesis and development of TNCs as actors in global economic relations. It also reviews the current role of TNCs in the global economy. The second part of the article examines the cooperation between Shell and Gazprom embodied in their joint realization of the Sakhalin-2 project and the prospects for the Sakhalin-3 project.
   The final section of the article contains analytical conclusions and theoretical recommendations. The authors came to two main conclusions. First, only transparent cooperation based on fair principles can guarantee stable economic ties between countries or any kind of global companies. Second, the accumulated experience in any field of cooperation provides quick and efficient payback of even the largest project. And even if the restrictions may correct (or try to correct) only in the short term but lay a foundation for long-term regress in relations, even one successful project, based on mutual trust and respect, can lead to a breakthrough in both economic and political relations between the countries.

TI RUSSIA IN THE FOREIGN POLICY PRIORITIES OF THE COUNCIL OF COOPERATION OF

SO MGIMO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Russia; the CIS; the Middle East; the Syrian crisis; terrorism; the
   Middle East conflict; Middle East settlement; strategic dialogue
AB The proposed article focuses on the change in the approach of the regional organization of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to Russia's role in the Middle East region and the efforts of its members to establish fruitful cooperation with it. A new approach followed the events of the "Arab Spring", among which the outcome was a complication of the regional situation and the emergence of a series of crises that forced the members of the GCC to expand the number of allies among the world's leading powers. Russia's active participation in resolving crisis situations in the Middle East, primarily in Syria, influenced the change in the GCC policy towards Russia, which realized its increased interest in establishing strong ties with the countries of this region.
   The article compares the relations that existed between Russia and the GCC states in the Soviet period and the initial period of the Russian Federation's existence, and those relations that began to develop after 2011 amid growing instability in the Middle East region. A new stage in bilateral relations was caused by the coincidence of their interests in the fight against the increased terrorist threat. The parties were also interested in conducting political consultations to resolve regional crisis situations.
   The coincidence of points of view between Russia and the GCC on the Middle East settlement has always been a reliable basis for building mutual understanding between the parties. At the same time, the contradictions that arose between them on the issue of ways out of the Syrian crisis led to a cooling in their relations.
   The authors conclude that the place of Russia in the foreign policy priorities of the GCC is going to grow. The mutual interest of the parties in political interaction is reinforced by the need to coordinate policy in the energy market, the largest suppliers of which are both Russia and the GCC states. In addition, both sides are striving to expand economic and military-technical cooperation, which will create a favorable situation for establishing relations in the political sphere.

DT Article
DE Communist party; "Party's Weeks"; Lenin's call; October call; social
   mobility; inspired mobility
AB The article describes the mass Party-call campaigns of non-party citizens within the Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks)-All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks), implemented in RSFSR and after in USSR. For the first time this method of replenishing of the Communist Party has been introduced in the end 1919 and was named a "Party's Week". Later, the most famous and large-scale versions became "Lenin's call" in 1924, and the "October call" in the end of 1927-beginning of 1928. Similarities in the main goals-increase of the number of Party members and, at the same time, change of its social composition-let us consider these campaigns as the same phenomena that had continuity and internal unity. In the article, for the first time in the Russian historiography "Party's Weeks", "Lenin's call" and the October call for joining the Party are considered through the prism of social mobility, intentionally inspired by the central government. The article analyzes circumstances and reasons that stated necessity and possibility for using mass Party calls, and the objectives of these campaigns, mechanisms and tools, and the results of these campaigns. The article states that from October 1919 to January 1928 about half a million of citizens joined the Communist Party. A hypothesis is made that the mobility inspired by the government was a type of social engineering. Such mobility was unstable because it focused strictly on the social rank and file who had a low level of general and political literacy and culture, and wasn't characterized by constructive social activity. As a result, thousands of citizens, who joined the Party, didn't manage to stay in it, exited or were excluded. The latter circumstance significantly reduced the efficiency of mass Party-call campaigns and prompted the leadership of the All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks) to abandon this method of replenishing the communist ranks.

DT Article
DE Pskovo-Pechorskiy region; ethnocultural process; national politics;
   ethnographic description; ethnolocal group; Setu; Russians; Estonian
AB Over several centuries, from at least the 1600s, a specific group was forming in the locality near the Pskovo-Pechorskiy monastery that differed from the surrounding Russian and Estonian population. This group included the Setu (who spoke an Estonian dialect) and Russians. Their mode of life as a native minority until 1920 can be described with the set of distinguishing features: Russian-Estonian bilingualism, material culture (tools, dwellings, clothes, diet), the social-economic network that developed around Pskovo-Pechorskiy monastery, a unity in the cycle of national holidays and common rites of passage. After 1920 (1920-1970), under the influence of Estonian national politics, the assimilation of the Setu took place. One part of autochthonous Russian population left this region, another part has dissolved in the stream of Russian migrants, whose amount increased from 1990-2000 due to the solidification of the Russian-Estonian border. The scientific investigation of the Setu influenced national politics. The formation of the late 19th and early 20th century conception that the Setu were archaic Estonians did not reflect the situation as a whole but gave birth to a doctrine about the necessity of transformation of the Setu into civilized Estonians. The appearance of the idea that the Setu is a subethnos of Estonians coincided with the process of their complete cultural assimilation. The formalization of national-cultural autonomy of the Setu in Estonia and their admission as an aboriginal native minority in Russia coincided with the total disappearance of this group in the system of social-economic and cultural relations of the Pskovsko-Pechorskiy area on both sides of border. At the same time the turn of 21st century saw the activation of the work of professional ethnic representatives who develop museum and folkloristic activity in the sphere of developing Setu memory. This reconstruction does not reflect renewal of Setu culture but is merely the cultural background of political events on the border between Russia and Estonia. Refs 53.

AB The article is devoted to political and cultural heritage of Sogdians ("merchants outside empires"). This is the Central Asian people, who lived in a period from around the 6th century BC. until the middle of the Middle Ages, and then were dispersed in the vastness of Khorasan region. Throughout its history the Sogdians played the role of the most important trade intermediaries on some segments of the Silk Road, many researchers today consider "Silk Road" and "Sogdian Trade Network" as synonyms notions. Sogdians were unique in their inclination not only to develop new products, but also to proliferate their own reinterpretation of new, mostly imported ideas. This is especially evident in their relations with the Chinese, including the period of the Tang dynasty ( 618-907), i.e., "Golden age" in the history of China.
   The article for the first time in Russian research literature represents Sogdians as a people who managed to influence the Eurasian cultural dynamics by introducing the principle of deterritorialization into relations with close and far neighbors.
   Most modern historians in Central Asia tend to ignore the contribution to "their" history from "strangers", neither mediators, nor neighbors. The appeal to the intellectual heritage of Sogdians as a people who promoted the transformation of the region into a crossroads of cultures would open the possibility of developing intellectual pluralism in each of the Central Asian countries today and would allow accelerating the creative modernization of the region as a whole.

AB This article considers spatial metaphors of the Internet and the possibility to extrapolate the frontier thesis of F. Turner on the electronic space. The authors believe that information and communication technologies and the digital world have become new spaces for the expansion of states or individuals. That is why there are ongoing scientific debates on the limits and potential of western and electronic frontiers' metaphors for analytical description of the digital space. The metaphor of the Internet as a western frontier is quite controversial; many authors prefer the electronic frontier analogy as more heuristic and valid for constructing metaphors of the digital reality. The network frontier is defined as a dynamic, elastic and permeable border of social and cultural practices of the network society. The authors estimate the heuristic potential of the concept 'network frontier' developed on the basis of integration of the frontier theory and the concept 'network society', taking into account the effects of globalization for the study of elastic, permeable and movable border of the network landscape. In the digital world, the spatiality transforms, the geography of the Internet network determines the metamorphosis of the frontier as a contact zone between online and offline spaces, which is dynamic, innovative, encourages mobility, and its permeability depends on the digital competence of citizens. The authors explain the mythology of western and electronic frontier; name the main network frontier myths related to the rhetoric of western frontier myth; describe the main components of the western frontier myth associated with the idea of American exceptionalism; and conclude with the identification of nowadays myths about frontier-men and the online space they master.

AB The study of socio-political attitudes of the Don Cossacks in the early 1920s is of large importance for understanding the socio-political processes in the south of Russia at that time. After the Soviet power was established in the Don region, relations of mutual distrust formed between the Cossacks and the new power. The Soviet authorities viewed the Cossacks as a potentially counter-revolutionary force, though actual economic collapse and repressions from the state authorities considerably undermined the counter-revolutionary enthusiasm and brought social apathy among the Cossacks. Generally the sociopolitical attitudes of the Don Cossacks in 19201922 can be described as follows. These were sporadic acts of disloyalty provoked primarily by the economic crisis and general social disruption in Cossack villages. By 1923 the situation had gradually changed. The economic growth contributed to a more positive attitude among Cossacks and peasants. The strengthening of the Soviet power, along with the policy of attention to peasants' and Cossacks' needs, made the Cossacks more loyal. They gradually got involved in the process of Soviet construction, took part in organization of the use of land, in elections to Soviet bodies, and so on. The article reveals the Don Cossacks' attitudes in 1920-1924 and determines their causes, characteristics and changes under various factors.

AB The article is devoted to the one of the most important periods of the history of the Egyptian campaign of the French army of Orient from August to December 1799. Then, after the flight from Egypt of Napoleon Bonaparte, his successor, General Kleber, was compelled to urgently take over the leadership of the troops and the occupation administration while trying to prevent the invading of the Ottoman army from Syria. The perfectly conceived military and political combination of Kleber, who sought to play on the contradictions of the powers of the anti-French coalition, collapsed due to a number of circumstances that did not depend on him, in particular, because of the catastrophic fall of morale of the French occupation troops after a year of their stay in the Orient. The result of the diplomatic failure of Kleber was the fall of the French frontier fort El Arish, which proved to be one of the bloodiest defeats of the army of Orient during the Egyptian expedition.

TI THE "MYTH OF THE JESUITS" IN THEIR ABSENCE: RUSSIA, THE 1860s
SO LOGOS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Walter Scott; Jesuits; Honore de Balzac; political myth; Slavophiles;
   Black Legend; Yuri Samarin
AB Political myths about conspiracies first appeared in the 19th century, primarily in the form of three "big" myths involving Masons, Jesuits and Jews, which in turn prompted the emergence a series of derivatives, such as the "Judeo-Masonic Conspiracy." A remarkable feature of the Russian version of the myth about Jesuits, which spread widely through many different societal layers and audiences in the 1860s, is that it was - unlike the French version, for example - created in the absence of Jesuits: the order had already been driven out - first from the capital and subsequently from the entire empire - by the end of the reign of Alexander I. This peculiarity has generated a series of characteristic features of the Russian version: without the possibility of relating it to any kind of real referent, the Russian "Jesuit" became a universal entity that could, depending on the situation, replace any other, thereby creating a system of correspondences.
   The characteristics of the mythological "Jesuit" were applied to entities that were seen as identical, such as "the Pole," "the Catholic," "the Priest," etc. Conversely, the Jesuit could also function as an assertion of non-identity. An example of this juxtaposition would be the image of the good Catholic shepherd who is far removed from Jesuit practices. The myth made it possible to sustain conflicting positions regarding the Catholic church (and, correspondingly, different government policies), ranging from equating it with the Jesuits, who in this case served as exemplary followers of the Catholic faith, following Catholic principles to the letter, to a defensive position against a shrewd and belligerent "Jesuitism" that aims to take over Catholicism. The functional appeal of the myth was related to the opportunity it provided to employ the ideological resources of other groups. Thus, the clerics or the defenders of Orthodoxy could use Enlightenment rhetoric, while anti-clericals could invoke the positions of the Orthodox Church, etc. Losing political relevance quickly, the Jesuit myth later proved to be an effective tool for the legitimation of new versions of the political myth, such as myths about a Jewish plot, forcing opponents to move from the deconstruction of any particular myth to a generalized critique of conspiracy theories.

DE institutional trust; society; public institutions; structure; dynamic;

AB Based on the results of sociological monitoring, this study is focused on the problem of trust in public institutions of contemporary Russian society. Particular attention is paid to the structure and dynamics of trust in the context of the current events and processes. A theoretical and methodological basis of research is the set of provisions considering the trust as a complex phenomenon in individuals' interaction in the face of uncertainty and risks. It is shown that institutional trust undergoes a constant dynamics under the influence of diverse and divergent processes. This is especially characteristic with regard to transitional societies, where at the same time there are stable and situational, objective and subjective, external and internal factors. The study found a concentration of trust around the institutions that implement state interests President, Government, the Military and Orthodox Church. In turn, the institutions that implement private (individual, group, corporate, regional) interests enjoy a low level of trust. These include parliament (State Duma and Council of Federation), courts, local self-government, political parties, trade unions, non-governmental organizations. All this indicates a lack of a real solidarity in the Russian society. Also we can see a spreading of parallel (informal and shadow) institutional trust's structures like favoritism, corruption, and nepotism.

AB The rise of the terrorist group "Islamic State" (also known as ISIS, ISIL, Daesh) amidst conflicts in Syria and Iraq has aggravated a crisis inside the Al-Qaeda depriving it of the "terrorist group number 1 in the world" status. Nevertheless, this terrorist network still exists and is active. Moreover, Al-Qaeda was able to adapt to ever-changing conditions, and its affiliates in different parts of the world act as powerful actors in regional conflicts (e.g. "Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula", "Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb", "Al-Shabaab" in Somalia, etc.). Syrian Civil War has generated a split of the former Iraqi branch of Al-Qaeda ("Islamic State of Iraq") and Al-Qaeda's Arab veterans into two major rival groups (ISIS and "Al-Nusra Front"). The rivalry of these groups in Syria has resulted in an antagonism between the "Islamic State" and Ayman al-Zawahiri's "historical" Al-Qaeda. Ideologically, the agendas of ISIS and Al-Qaeda are very similar (Salafi Jihadism, intolerance, pivotal hostility towards West and Shia Muslims, moderate Sunni Muslims and current political regimes in Islamic world, etc.). The difference between two of them is about the issue of a " caliphate" declaration. Ideological disagreements between Al-Qaeda and ISIS provide an opportunity to explain Al-Qaeda's tactics and strategy which help it overcome the crisis and keep itself as a global organization pretending to be a leader of the international Jihadist movement. This group still poses a threat to the world, and it is necessary to unify efforts of a broad international community to counter this threat.

AB In the introduction part of the article the author gives a proof of the topicality issue, defines the goal and formulates the problem of the research. In the main part of the article the author identifies the ontological and epistemological basis of the study of creative thinking at the present stage of development of scientific knowledge. The most of the fundamental works in the field of thinking form a certain unity of logical and psychological ideas about thinking. From the point of view of modern research, several groups of directions can be identified that are oriented both to the study of theoretical thinking and to the achievement of a practical result and its close interrelation with experiment. The first group of directions is aimed at studying the ontological foundations of creative thinking. This is understanding of thinking in the context of the act of communication and in the context of activities. The second group of directions is focused on the identification and analysis of epistemological foundations of creative thinking. The main questions of this group are the specifics of the mechanisms of the functioning of creative thinking and the work of creative intuition, the ways of developing and training creative thinking, the conditions that help to realize the creative potential of the individual, the features of creative thinking when creating artificial intelligence systems. The basic terms of this group are creativity, intuition, imagination, intellect, artificial intelligence. Studies in the first direction are focused on studying a certain set of personal characteristics, abilities that determine the development of non-standard thinking in a particular area. Aiming at studying the general methodological issues of creativity and creative thinking is the basis for identifying the second direction. Studies of creative thinking in science form the basis of the third direction. At the end of the article the author summarizes and concludes.

DE retail; consumer behaviour; socio-economic approach
AB The article deals with socio-economic approach, analysis of empirical research of consumer behaviour of different models in the retail markets in Russia during 2006-2016. Analysis of practice of the Russian retail market is presented in the context of theories which analyse the combination of competition and coordination of dealings of retailers, suppliers, customers, competitors and elites of the regional and federal levels (V. Radaev). The authors based their analysis also on the political-cultural approach (N. Fligstein), which offers a new view on the forms of economic stability and instability in the modern market, where embedded political and institutional processes hold the leading position. As the authorities got involved in global investment and in resolving social conflicts in modern societies, it is necessary to understand that the conditions of the Western sanctions (European Union, United States and other countries), which were introduced because of the conflict in the East of Ukraine, and the Russian response to them also lead to the lock-in effect (D. North), which affected the model of a Russian consumer behaviour. Consumers are not ready to support the import substitution, preferring higher quality and functionality of western analogues, or postponing the purchase. That fact indicates the unwillingness of the Russian industry for import substitution. The decline of customer activity, active savings behaviour, and a sharp reduction of the small business trade are one of the trends in the retail market, which were uncovered by the authors. These changes in the retail market increase the level of social tension.

DE Siberia; museum science; charity; donations for the sake of museums
AB This article deals with the charitable activities for the sake of Museum science in Siberia in the 19th and early 20th century. It turns out that the private museums, which were created by M. A. Zenzinov, M. D. Boutin, V. P. Sukachev, married couple of I. A. and J. P. Matveyev, A. I. Kytmanov in the second half of the 19th century, constitute an example of their own free will and disinterested help to museums.
   The authors emphasize that national and public museums in Siberia enjoyed charitable support as well. This support took a form of financing the construction of Museum buildings, the organization of different museum works. It is shown, that Irkutsk museum was constructed in 1882-1883 owing to money collected by the citizens. The building was expanded on merchant P. A. Sievers' donation subsequently. Krasnoyarsk merchants Kuznetsovs and Danilovs donated their money in building Minusinsk Museum and its expeditions. Merchant A. D. Startsev donated stone house for Museum in Kyakhta. Then two-storey building of Yakutsk Museum was built on the funds of local benefactors F. V. Astrakhantsev and G. V. Nikiforov.
   Private donations ensured the acquisition of valuable collections. For example, Archaeological Museum of the Imperial Tomsk University, created in 1882, was based on Tobolsk collection of antiquities, bought thanks to money of merchant M. K. Sidorov. In addition, the Siberian Maecenases and merchants A. M. Sibiryakov, A. F. Tolkachev, Z. M. Tsibulskiy, I. G. Gadalov, A. D. Vasenev contributed funds for the acquisition of collections to Tomsk University museums.
   According to the authors of the article, the most important role in the replenishment of all Siberian museums belong to investigators and collectors. In fact, Tomsk governor and collector P. K. Frolov, who initiated the creation of the Museum in Management of Kolyvan-Voskresenskiy plants in Barnaul in 1823, put in it his own archaeological collection. The Minusinsk museum created by N. M. Mart'yanov in 1877 was based on founder's natural sciences collection. Gifts of geologist V. A. Obruchev, archaeologist I. T. Savenkov, ethnographer M. N. Hangalov, as well as an outstanding researcher of Siberia and Central Asia G. N. Potanin ensured the rebirth of the Irkutsk Museum after a fire in 1879. A former political exile A. K. Kuznetsov had founded Nerchinsk and Chita museums using his own botanical, geological and archaeological collections. Collectors B. P. Shostakovich, I. P. Kuznetsov-Krasnoyarskiy, G. P. Saf'yanov replenished with their collections and museum subjects Tomsk University Archaeological museum. The founder of Archaeological museum professor V. M. Florinskiy donated a good portion of his collections into this repository.
   Summarizing the information, the authors conclude that charitable support provided the growth and development of Siberian museums during XIX-beginning of XX century. They are sure that available experience of making gifts and donations to museums can be used nowadays.

DE new epoch; philosophical problems; forms of knowledge packaging
AB The place and role of any field of intellectual culture is determined by the problems generated in it. From the second half of XX century the loss of a high-status philosophy in intellectual culture is closely connected with history and the current state of philosophical problems. However, the decrease of interest to philosophy among intellectuals is accompanied by a crisis in intellectual culture in general, including fundamental sciences. The article highlights the past, present, and future of philosophical problematizations. The past is determined by the view of philosophy as the "queen of sciences", and its mission as the role of discoverer of eternal truths. The value of the problems of philosophy in comparison with scientific problems is determined by their principal unsolvability. The present state of philosophical problematic is conditioned by the deepening of the global systemic crisis caused by the exhaustion of the intellectual resource formed in "axial time". Since the end of XX and with the beginning of the XXI century the process of transition to a new era are started. This allows the philosophy to turn to the formulation of problems that prepare the intellectual culture for transition to a qualitatively new state. Formulations of the problems which relevant to modern philosophy are listed, and their brief comment is given. The future of philosophical problematic is associated with ideas about the new coordinates of the philosophy development and intellectual culture in general. It is suggested that philosophical problems in the XXI century will be associated with an appeal to intellectual intuitions; contradictions of tendencies of universalization / nationalization of languages of intellectual culture; formats of knowledge packaging. Several trends in the development of intellectual culture are allocated, according to which it is appropriate to develop new philosophical problematizations: the transition of research strategies to the level of system synthesis; integration of humanitarian and exact sciences; harmonization of automation of reasoning and computing. It is concluded that the strategic advantages of the subjects in the XXI century will be determined by innovations in the field of methods of thinking.

TI POLITICAL RISKS OF FOREIGN INVESTMENTS OF RUSSIAN COMPANIES
SO MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE political risks; foreign investment; Russia; EU; European integration;
   sanctions; energy policy
AB The article analyzes political risks faced by the Russian companies in their foreign investment activities. The concept of political risks and their main types are considered. Since the bulk of the capital outflow from Russia goes to European countries, the main attention is paid to political risks, accompanying investments in the countries of this region. The peculiarity of the current situation is that the worsening of political relations with Western countries has led not only to an increase in external political risks that affect the foreign investment activity of Russian companies, but also weakened the investment attractiveness of the Russian economy itself. The Russian business is squeezed between the grips of high internal and external risks. The increase of political risks worsens access to the sources of raw materials and markets, restricts the receipt of new technologies, impedes the participation of Russian companies in the transnational production networks and slows down the economic growth. Analysis of investment risks leads to the conclusion that there is a need for institutional reforms within the country and normalization of political relations with developed countries. Among the political risks faced by Russian investors in Europe the most important are the risks associated with the course of European integration, sanctions and EC energy policy. The threat of the disintegration of the European economic space represents a significant investment risk. But an excessively rapid movement along the path of integration is also dangerous since it is accompanied by radical transformation of the regulatory framework and is fraught with the unbalancing of the integration process. Sanctions limited the sources of investment finance and spheres of capital application, increased the risks of discriminatory treatment of Russian companies abroad. Political investment risks for Russian companies are rising in the context of Brussels' energy policy of diversifying gas sources. The construction of gas pipelines is especially highly sensitive to political risks. It is important for the investor not just to secure the guarantees of the buyer, but to attract financing from his side in order to share investment risks with him.

AB The article examines the social and professional composition of the State Duma of the sixth convocation. The purpose of the study is to identify and analyze the socio-professional categories that serve as sources of recruitment for the deputy corps. As a theoretical basis, a wide range of works by domestic and foreign authors devoted to recruiting the political elite was used. The method of investigation can be defined as a structural-biographical analysis. The empirical basic research is a database, which includes biographical information about 532 parliamentarians who worked in the State Duma of the sixth convocation. The sources of data arranged in personal questionnaires and then processed statistically were websites of state bodies, commercial structures, and biographical Internet portals. The study showed that the political elite of the Russian Federation are substantially rooted in the structures of the political and administrative power of Soviet society: Among the deputies of the State Duma, the nomenclature experience is more common to a greater extent than for the administrative and economic elites of the country. The important trend in the post-Soviet career of deputies is political professionalization. A noticeable trend is the bureaucratization of the deputy corps, many of whom worked in the post-Soviet period in administrative structures. There is dynamic interlocking between the federal administrative and the political elites, especially at the level of the Duma leadership. Quite pronounced is the militarization of the political elite, although there are fewer people from the force structures than in the administrative elite. Business is a most important source of recruitment of the political elite outside the political and administrative structures. Although there are few descendants from large nationwide businesses, interlocking of the country's economic and political elites does take place. Finally, some professional categories widely represented in the legislatures of a number of Western countries-lawyers and educators-are rather poorly presented in the Duma. The author concludes that these recruitment tendencies can, on the one hand, be related to the specifics of the political and economic organization of Russian society (the weakness of the parliament, "crony capitalism", etc.), and, on the other hand, influence the political attitudes and behaviors of legislators (including their attitude regarding the Soviet past, the political regime, and the interests of various social groups).

TI THE REVOLUTIONARY TERROR IN RUSSIA: INFLUENCE ON THE PROCESS AND RESULTS

DT Article
DE political terror of early twentieth century; elections to First State
   Duma of Russian Empire; elections to Second State Duma of Russian
   Empire; Duma election campaigns; Revolution of 1905-1907; absenteeism
AB The aim of this article is to trace the effect of political terror on the behavior of voters, electoral tactics of the parties participating in the first Duma election campaigns. 1905-1907 is not only the period of the First revolution in Russia, but also the first and second national elections to the State Duma. The impact of revolutionary terror on the elections in the First and Second State Dumas of the Russian Empire has not been the subject of special study in domestic and foreign historiography. The article is written based on documents that are stored in both central and local archives: the Russian State Historical Archive, the State Archive of the Russian Federation, the Manuscript Department of the Institute of Russian Literature of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the State Archive of Tver Region. Most of the archival documents are first introduced into scientific use. An important source for the study of the problem is the periodicals of that time: 1) newsprint periodicals of political parties participating in the first elections to the Duma: Rech (Constitutional- Democratic Party), Golos Moskvy (The Union of October 17), Russkoe znamya, Den (The Union of Russian People), 2) the press of South-Western, Western and Central regions of the Russian Empire that suffered most from the revolutionary terror: Drug, Varshavskiy vestnik, Rizhskiy vestnik, Novoe vremya, Rossiya, Slovo, Russkoe slovo. The research uses the historicaltypological method (for classification of reviews, description of articles in the press), historical-genetic, chronological, synchronous and comparative methods. On the basis of the conducted research it is possible to draw the following conclusions: revolutionary terror complicated the creation of moderate and rightist political parties and impeded the normal conduct of their election campaigns: terrorists physically eliminated their leaders, blew up bombs in the premises of electoral assemblies, destroying campaign literature. On the other hand, terror facilitated the electoral victory of the Constitutional Democrats, since the latter did not condemn the cases of revolutionary terror and the Russian society perceived them as a leftist political force. Revolutionary terror had a major influence on the behavior of the electorate, becoming one of the causes of absenteeism of voters. During the Revolution of 1905-1907 the Russian media actively shaped public opinion in regard to revolutionary terror, but could not develop a common position in condemning terror. Right-wing liberals, monarchists and governmental press actively fought against terror and tried to create a negative attitude to it in the country. However, the attitude towards terror was set by the left-liberal publications which quantitatively and qualitatively outnumbered the moderate and right print. The left-liberal press looked at revolutionary terror through the prism of the fight against "the hated state", imposing the blame for the scope of it on the government.

AB The paper discusses some aspects of integration of different regions and societies in the course of historical globalization. Within historical globalization one can observe a close correlation between such important processes as technological transformations, urbanization, political integration, struggle for political hegemony, etc. In the paper we analyze these correlations in more or less details. We also try to associate historical globalization and its aspects with the phases of expansion of spatial links between societies. Within the expansion process we point out seven levels from the local level through the planetary one. The most significant changes were associated with crucial technological breakthroughs, or production revolutions and other related transformations like the Urban Revolution. The latter can be regarded as a phase transition of the Afroeurasian world-system to a qualitatively new level of complexity. There are also several periods which one can define as landmarks in the World-System history. The paper also offers some theoretical ideas about cycles of divergence and convergence.

A subtle mind, intelligent and observant man, in addition to his reports he wrote his letters almost every other day to his wife, leaving a lot of information to the descendants on Bulgaria, its nature, cities and villages, the physical appearance of the Bulgarians, their behavior, dwellings and customs. His letters are also of considerable value as the evidence of changing mentality in the Russian "upper echelons" regarding the political future of Bulgaria and the degree of readiness of the Bulgarians themselves to join the struggle for their freedom arms in hands.

AB The article shows the results of comparative analysis of philosophical cognition and architectural planning. The logic of comparative analysis methodology is specified by the activity and the externalist approaches within the philosophical cognition and architectural planning are activities inscribed into a defined sociocultural context.
   The result of the comparative analysis revealed the relative similarity of these activities. Firstly, the subject of philosophical cognition and of architectural planning is a unity of subjective and objective, rational and emotional; the objectivism factors are social and cultural reality into which is inscribed the subject of philosophical cognition and of architectural planning, the paradigm of philosophizing, aesthetic paradigm, or style - for architectural planning; in both cases, the significance of the result is determined by the fact that the subject stands as the highest tension of emotional experience.

Thirdly, the subject reality for philosophical cognition is becoming the ontological model of reality created by the author, the basic concepts which are the data of the phenomenological analysis, for the subject of architectural planning - the artistic reality, the system of artistic images, as data of hermeneutic-connotative intentions.

AB In the article the author reviews the activities of the All-Union Society for the Distribution of Political and Scientific Knowledge (the society "Znanie" [knowledge] since 1963) as one of the main educating organizations of the USSR in the second half of the 20th century. In the study, the author concluded that the idea of establishing a mass educating organization in the Soviet Union was popular and perspective; however, the methods were not always thought out. On the one hand, the author highlights the positive aspects of popularization of science in the USSR. An extensive network of city, district and primary organizations in the structure of science educating could cover almost all the inhabitants of the Soviet Union. Large-scale publishing and lecture activities allowed each person to acquire new knowledge, regardless of social status, income and educational level. Materials published by the society "Znanie" gave real help to teachers, engineers, workers and farmers, to all who wanted to expand their political, scientific and general cultural outlook. The main ideas of all the educating activities of the society were the ideas of necessity for every person to constantly acquire new knowledge, improve work, the ideas of patriotism, the sense of duty and responsibility. On the other hand, the author specifies essential shortcomings. Being actually incorporated into the network of the party and government institutions, the society had no independence and initiative and tried to carry out the "order" of the Party on the mass involvement of all the population in the educating and propaganda activities. The constant increase of the number of propaganda activities, the involvement of a great number of people who did not always have sufficient education and qualification to give public lectures deteriorated the quality of the educating events and reduced the interest of the population to the popularization of science. The author pointed out that biased and often negative attitude of the part of population to educating lectures has remained to this day. Emphasizing the relevance of the study, the author points out that the necessity of a high-quality system of popularization of science is recognized today by the state authorities, the scientific community and the public in general. According to the author, comprehension of the Soviet project of science popularization can help to design an effective model of science popularization and to avoid the mistakes that were made in the Soviet times.

DE deaf; deafness; hearing loss; mixed methods; cultural consumption
AB The analysis of the methodological and analytical experience of conducting the mixed methods research of deaf and hard of hearing people is considered in this article. Ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities makes sociological study of people with various forms of disability especially relevant. At the same time, people with disabilities in most studies are analised as a homogeneous group which does not require differentiation of methods of their study. The lack of attention to people with hearing impairments, as an objects of various studies, usually leads to the use of research design, which ignores the cultural and linguistic features of this community. R. Winiarczyk and E. Wilson note that understanding of complex phenomena such as "culture of the deaf" can not be achieved by using only one research method. They suggest combining in-depth interviews, focus groups, surveys, observations and analysis of natural Documents within one study in order to obtain an valid result. In the described study was used the consecutive mixed methods design, in which the first qualitative stage allowed the full understanfing of the "Deaf culture" notion and selection of indicators for specific cultural practices of the community of people with hearing impairments. This information was later used during condicting a mass poll of deaf and hard of hearing respondents. The use of such design is optimal when the researcher needs the revealing of certain concepts and instrumental elaboration of concepts related to poorly studied groups. In general, the analysis of the structure of interrelated practices, preferences and motives of cultural consumption, which form the patterns of cultural consumption of the deaf and hard of hearing people, made it possible to identify three key sustainable models: "cultural inclusion," "cultural isolation," and "passive cultural consumption". Interrelation of both stages of the study allows us to conclude that specific cultural practices play a special role for deaf and hard of hearing people. Moreover, cultural institutions perform primarily communicative and social functions.

DE street art; graffiti; social practice; art practice
AB The last ten years researching street art as a large-scale socio-cultural phenomena has increased many times over. But until now, researchers discuss about the nature of street art, its genesis, and even the legitimacy of the term. One of the key open issues is the question of the Genesis of street art. One of the key open questions is the question of the genesis of street art. The vast majority of researchers speak about the formation of street art from the earlier practice of graffiti. At the same time, questions about the genesis of the graffiti and the problem of continuity and separation of graffiti and street art are quite controversial. Currently, the research Convention is achieved in the understanding of the Genesis of street art, which appeared as the continuation of the development of American graffiti 1970-ies.. Most researchers agree with the concept of Baudrillard, which considers the American graffiti as a new socio-cultural phenomenon, born in the protest movement of American cities and different in their characteristics from traditional graffiti. Thus, the version of the genesis of modern American graffiti (but also grew out of his street art) from traditional graffiti is gradually replaced by scientific discourse. In addition, researchers have reached the Convention in understanding the essence of this socio-cultural phenomenon. Despite the commercialization and institutionalization of street art, most researchers consider it the essential signs of the desire to fight for the redistribution of public space, illegal occupation of urban spaces and surfaces, an open expansion and the total spread of new symbolic systems, codes and descriptive messages; the nature of the protest, free expression on political and social issues, and building dialogue with citizens (open, dialogical communication); the fragility of created objects; balancing on the verge between art and vandalism. While discussions about the specifics of street art have continued, there is a gradual transition from a simple essentialist questions about the nature of street art to a more mobile contextual logic, allowing through street art to explore the various aspects of social relationships and practices.

"Turn to the city" in cultural studies and in philosophy was outlined at the turn of the two-thousands. Before that the city problems were analyzed mainly in the field of sociology, social geography, and economics. At the same time, the discourse of "production of space" was formed. The understanding of space as the result of production has arisen due to the fact that it was necessary to conceptualize a city as a process in which various actors are involved, including various urban communities. The article deals with the possibilities and willingness of urban communities to participate in the process of transformation of Russian cities, and reveals how real or virtual groups of residents are able to resist ill-conceived design decisions.

The article are studied the possible trajectory of events related to contemporary political discussions events of culture, and their influence on the future. Social prognostication is based on the concept of social memory and social-cultural approach. Today, the traumatic events of the past are refracted in the public mind as the contradictions of historical and social memory. The social memory structures stored date information for people's daily life, their survival. The structures of social memory stored date information for people's daily life, their survival. The content of the historical memory forms a common ideology. These types of memory are interdependent and influence the collective consciousness of the community, influence the perception of community members actual historical events, on the fate of social groups and individuals. The contradictions between these types of memory exist on the macro and micro levels and are the driving force for the development of social innovation, processes of national consciousness. Alternative scenario leads to self-destructive culture. At the macro level made out contradictions between the values of the official and everyday culture, the contradictions associated with the collapse of traditions and contradictions of power. These contradictions reflect the bifurcated state of collective consciousness in which social memory of the traumatic experience conflicts with ideologemes situational properties. The memory of politics, solving situational ideological problem, distorting images of the past, brings the risk of recurrence of traumatic situations in the future. The forming real-life scenarios rings include the stages of injury, capture the life of future generations. The authors explore the socio-cultural differences and reflect on the possibility of the idea of Orthodoxy as an ideological concept of integrating Russian society from the perspective of social memory functioning laws, preserving the historical and cultural experience of trauma. The authors explore the socio-cultural contradictions and speculate about possibility of the idea of Orthodoxy as an ideological concept of integrating Russian society from the perspective of laws of the social memory functioning, retaining the historical and cultural experience of trauma.

DE identity; identification; self-identity; self
AB The term "identity" has gone through a long-term evolution: from the literal meaning of an object's equivalence to itself, to complex characteristics concerning the integrity of a human inner world. Originally, the notion of identity was used in philosophical reflections about the nature of things; however, starting from the early modern age, this term has been applied to characterize a person's sense of sameness and of continuity of their existence through time and space, which is based on the continuity of consciousness and ability to remember. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, they used the concept of "Self" for unity of personality, which may be formed only in a context of social interaction. The basic formation mechanism for "Self" was considered to be a person's self-categorizing as a part of social groups, viewed as "friendlies" and self-opposing to other communities, recognized as "foreigners". As a result of these processes, a person recognizes, on one hand, his affiliation and alliance with a certain social environment and, on the other hand, detaches himself from this environment through awareness of his peculiarity, his selfness. Nowadays, the concept of "identity" is used in the following basic meanings: constancy in time, uniqueness, "selfness" as a personal authenticity, psychophysiological integrity, psychological determinacy, continuity of life experience, degree of conformity to social expectations, and affiliation with a certain community. Along with personal identity there is a notion of "national identity", involving national or ethnic sameness, which allows a nation or ethnicity to determine their place in the world. The article suggests to interpret the concept of identity as a certain fixed combination of individual, sociocultural, national and civil parameters that answer the questions: "Who am I?" or "Who are we?". We can speak of identity only in relation to subjects - a person or a group of persons able to recognize themselves and separate themselves from others. We should not apply this term to inanimate objects. We can speak only of their identification by people, that is, of the determination by intellectual beings of their specificity and affiliation with a certain type, class and group.

AB Introduction. The paper presents an overview of and reasons behind Content-Language Integrated Learning (CLIL). Nowadays, CLIL is clearly on its way to becoming an option - not yet an obligation - for higher education in the world. Against the background of internationalization and globalization perspectives, educational institutions around the globe face the need to create borderless education that entails the challenge of programme competitiveness and language acquisition. CLIL is considered as a driver for both. The efficacy of the approach made Russian educators look at its side taking into account the lack of "drag and drop" practices and the specificity of Russian university environment, including national specificity of the country in general.
   The aim of the article is to work out some recommendations for smooth implementation of CLIL in Russian higher education.
   Methodology and research methods. The methods involve system-based and comparative analysis, generalization and modeling.
   Results and scientific novelty. The existing theories and descriptors specifying CLIL approach are analysed; the review of CLIL implementation in higher education abroad is drawn up. The possibilities of inclusion of elements of CLIL approach in educational process of modern higher education institution for the purpose of improvement of language training of experts and a condition of internationalization of high school education in general are considered from the positions of national specifics of the Russian system of higher education, and also culturological, social, economic and political factors.
   Practical significance of the published material consists in suggestions and recommendations for improvement of university graduates' language training, which has to correspond ideally to the level sufficient for implementation of international professional activity. According to the authors, the requirement of such preparation should be recorded in educational standards as an indispensable condition of getting higher education.

AB As think tanks continue to grow exponentially in number worldwide, their influence on world politics has also been increasing. These think tanks, including Russia's policy-oriented scientific research institutes, study a wide range of pressing political, social and economic issues, present their ideas and recommendations to national governments and international institutions, and promote international dialogue to foster solutions to world's most burning problems. For think tanks to remain trustworthy and influential, they need to maintain their integrity, independence of judgement, in-depth scholarship, and a sharpened focus on real-world outcomes. Their impact will also depend on their efficiency in promoting their findings through an active publications campaign, first-rate conferences and seminars, skillful outreach programs, innovative Internet activities, and cutting-edge social networking. With the assistance of think tanks, the world politics will be better informed and thus more enlightened, future-oriented, resourceful, and better equipped to find solutions to ongoing conflicts, build international cooperation, and avoid crises in the future.

DE pedagogical metaphor; pedagogical metaphorology students; teachers;
   academic subjects
AB The study of the types, functions and pragmatics of metaphors in different kinds of discourse (educational, medical, military, technological, political, etc.) is a promising area in contemporary science. The goal of this research is to describe the main achievements of Russian and foreign pedagogical metaphorology, to single out its main branches and to classify its methods and heuristics. The article presents a new classification of research works in pedagogical metaphorology according to the subjects of speech (teachers and children), addressees (metaphors referred to children, and metaphors addressed to colleagues, parents and the society), types of discourse (scientific, mass media or educational), belonging of the research to psycho-pedagogical or philosophical paradigms. As different from traditional research, contemporary studies are connected primarily with two aspects of metaphorical semiotics: cognitive and pragmatic in the first case the analysis of metaphors is a key to understanding conceptual worldview that exists in the minds of the participants of educational process; in the second case, a metaphor is a means of manipulation, and, at the same time, a tool to arouse teachers' and parents' interest. The research concludes that the system of pedagogical metaphors depends on traditions, social conditions and educational system, philosophical views and personality of the author, their interpretation of education, relations between teachers, students and parents. The main fields where the results of this research may be useful are the studies of peculiarities of the mental worldview of teachers and students, the choice of the most efficient methods of teaching with the use of metaphors, identification of individual and national peculiarities of metaphor comprehension and the analysis of historical dynamics of pedagogical views.

DE 18th century Russia; history of concepts; intellectual history;
   political culture; monarchy; monarchism; absolutism; republicanism;
   constitutionalism; public sphere
AB The article analyses an issue related to the methods underlying the study of the political thought and - broader - the political culture in 18th century Russia. The author examines the methods of the " Cambridge school" of political history, which is represented by the works of Q. Skinner and J. G. A. Pocock, and estimates the possibilities of using these methods upon Russian soil. Combining Skinners' conception of " cultural lexicons" with the research ideas of M. M. Bakhtin (the theory of speech genres), the author considers the opportunity to study 18th century Russian political thought through the specification of certain communicative spheres - the court sphere and the public sphere. In the author's opinion, the character of the political debate in each communicative sphere was defined by the relations between the addresser and the addressee within the process of communication. The court sphere was dominated by the panegyric, the manifesto and the report, which were all aimed at talking over different aspects of the absolutist vision of politics. In its turn, the public sphere, which started developing in the mid- 18th century - a domain of book and journal publishers - was a space suitable for the formation of alternative political discourses (including republican political thinking). In conclusion, the author suggests a reform of the history of political culture to make it a history of individual authors, talking about politics in different communicative spheres, using certain concepts to achieve pragmatic purposes, while simultaneously staying within the bounding context of a "cultural lexicon".

ID COUNCIL
AB This article gives an overview of small power problem focusing on the behaviour of small power states within coalitions and their proneness to free riding. To pursue an independent agenda and increase their significance within large associations, the authors argue, small powers tend to create 'coalitions within coalitions', essentially acting as free riders and transferring costs and political responsibility for decision-making to larger players. Such an asymmetric strategy makes it possible for small powers to advance their interests within alliances and save resources. The authors test this hypothesis on the behaviour of the Baltics in the European Union. It is demonstrated that Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia have created a stable small coalition within the EU and actively form ad hoc alliances with the leading states to push union-level decisions, as it was the case with settling the migrant issue. In other areas, these states tend to benefit from free-riding behaviour.

AB The article is devoted to the urgent problem related to the development of the region, namely, the creation of tools for the assessment of the level of social dissatisfaction in the region. The assessment of the level of social dissatisfaction is one of the most important tasks of state organizations in political and social spheres. The article considers the concept of "social dissatisfaction" and associated terms, it substantiates the author's position on the content of this notion. The authors have investigated the existing national and international approaches to the assessing of social tensions of the population. The system of socio-economic development indicators doesn't contain indicators allowing to assess the level of social dissatisfaction without the results of public polls. We propose two models in the article. In the first model, the assessment is basedon the single factor (the index of social dissatisfaction based on income differentiation). The second complex model takes into account a number of factors (the index of social dissatisfaction based on complex assessment). For the calculation of the proposed indicators, the authors use the statistical data of the Federal State Statistics Service. The methodological research tools include the mathematical methods of statistical data processing. We have evaluated the methodological tools on the example of the Republic of Ingushetia. The assessment has showed the dynamics of a decline in the level of social-economic dissatisfaction in the region (1995-2011). The models of social dissatisfaction constitute a tool for rapid and up-to-date assessment of socio-economic system sustainability, and of the willingness of the population to participate in protests. The application of the results of this study is the support of decision-making regions and state structures in working out plans of the socio-economic development of the regions.

DT Article
DE Scientific theory; scientific paradigm; document science; document;

AB The article attempts a methodological analysis of existing document theories in the modern scholarship. As some of them are termed the "general", other, consequently, should be viewed as "specific". This analysis is to determine, whether these theories meet the requirements of post-non-classical science and whether they reveal the substance of document as a social phenomenon. The article highlights informational, legal, communication, management, and phenomenological document theories, based on pertaining scientific approaches. The article analyzes object and subject of these theories, scientific world view, frameworks, and scientific methods applied to the study of document. The author assesses the theories explanatory potential, framework of categories and concepts, patterns predicted by the theories, their flexibility and practical applicability. The author assesses the significance of their contribution to the scientific knowledge of document and the prospects of the scientific explanatory theories development. The article advances a development trend of the document theory on synergetic paradigm that explains the document nature not just as data fixed in permanent form, but as an instrument of social (rational purpose pointing) action and social self-organization. The synergetic paradigm places document in the framework of global social world view and in that of the evolution of social development, which is seen as a succession of periods of chaos (revolution, war, etc.) and order (state, political regime, etc.). In this perpetual process of global evolution, the document is seen as a main instrument of social self-organization. Studying document by novel means of philosophical, social and historical, social and political analysis, developing its theoretical synergetic model and identifying patterns of document flow in the social continuum reveal its nature as an instrument of social (rational purpose pointing) action and social self-organization. Therefore, synergetic theory of document is to be considered an explanatory theory.

AB The book criticized in this article is devoted to a very important and topical subject: the interaction between the young Russian political science and the old Russian historical scholar. The authors want to "return political science to history" and this intention one can only welcome. But the author of this review was extremely surprised when he found the idea that for a better understanding of the current political situation there is no need to immerse yourself in history. In the opinion of the reviewer, this is a big mistake that prevents understanding modern Russian history and explaining it to readers. But this error is a result of poor knowledge of Russian history and a mistaken attitude to historiography, which is used very selectively. The analysis of all the provisions made by the authors has not allowed the author of the review to agree with any of these provisions. This applies primarily to the interpretation of "self-government" in Russia. Then to the understanding of the role of the so-called clan system whose concept the authors took from a Western scholar. The authors were unable to demonstrate the existence of it in modern Russia. Their idea about the identity of modern Russian political regime with the regimes in Taiwan or Pakistan is amusing because the reviewer is sure that the West is West, East is East, and Russia is Russia. The authors do not understand this, and therefore their predictions and advices in connection with the future of Russia "hang in the air". On this background, the last Chapter in which the authors still want to appeal to history in search of answers to the challenges of modernity looks quite curious. Since it is in contradiction with the authors' previous statements, and as already noted, they do not want to know the history, their excursions into history thus do not go beyond banal and trivial findings. Final reviewer's conclusion is: A. Lukin and P. Lukin are unable to "return politics to the history" or, in other words, they are unable to enrich the political scholar with great historical knowledge. Refs 11.

AB The article presents generalized results of the study of the national-state identity of the Russian youth in the post-Soviet period. Political-psychological approach was employed as a theoretical-methodological foundation for the analysis. On the basis of the empirical data collected during the implementation of the long-term research project Formation of National-State Identity in Modern Russia, T.Evgenyeva and A.Selezneva trace changes in the value-symbolic space of the youth's identity - from the "emptiness" of the 1990s to the contradictory fragmentation of the 2010s - and document key psychological problems associated with this process. In their opinion, the "Crimean consensus" failed to become a sufficiently solid ground for the construction of the Russian nation and is gradually losing its significance as a factor of civil self-identification. In this situation, civil self-identification among young people can take the form of searching for alternative social and political projects, increasing interest in images and symbols offered by opposition politicians.

   Kozlova's Thought for the Political Theory of Modernity
SO SOCIOLOGICESKOE OBOZRENIE
LA Russian
DT Article
DE totalitarianism; narrative; autobiography; Soviet; archive; power;
   subjectivity
AB This article is intended to present and reconstruct the original theoretical vision of the Soviet society elaborated by the Russian social theorist, philosopher, and political anthropologist Natalya Kozlova (1946-2002). In contrast to common media and theoretical wisdom tagging Soviet society as "totalitarian," Kozlova proposed a vivid theoretical picture consisting of diverse everyday practices and social techniques comprising the Soviet version of modernity. This picture is based on the thorough sociological and anthropological analysis of different autobiographical narratives and diaries of everyday life as written by ordinary actors of Soviet modernization. The theoretical analysis of the Soviet modernity presented in this "bottom-up" perspective radically puts the theoretical relevance of any unifying and undifferentiated dominant political and ideological concepts and narratives that depict its history as the one of endless repression leaving no room for the actions of individual actors to be brought into question. The article analyses the detrimental influence of widespread media and theoretical narratives based on such ideologically informed concepts as " totalitarianism," "internal colonization," or "open society" on the theoretical conceptualization of the Soviet experience. It argues that the mainstream, uncritical usage of these stigmatizing narratives in the Russian media and in social science impedes new ways of thinking about the Soviet experience. Following the theoretical insights revealed by the research project of Natalya Kozlova, the paper explores the topics of agency, power, and the production of subjectivity while proposing the invention of ways for a more sophisticated comprehension of Soviet society within a wider context of the political theory of modernity.

AB This article offers a comparative study of animal rights and animal welfare activism in Poland and Russia. It investigates how an East European democratic state, on the one hand, and a post-Soviet semiauthoritarian state, on the other hand, steer civic activism and how different state-society relationships affect the forms that activism takes. The analysis aims at identifying the specific institutional mechanisms by which steering operates in the two cases, thus explaining some notable similarities between the movements in the two countries, such as the focus on noncontentious animal welfare issues, but also the differences between them. Although facing a more repressive context, the contentious radical flank of the Russian movement is more active than the Polish one.

AB A. Gilev, A. Semenov and I. Shevtsova analyze correlation between professional career of local authorities and electoral results of the "party of power", appealing to the explanatory power of a "political machine" concept and relying on the database that includes biographies of municipal heads in three Russian regions. The study shows that heads of local governments, who previously held positions of a deputy mayor, heads of departments or other high posts in local administration, secure better electoral results for the "party of power' than those with business or legislative backgrounds. Skills of managing local "political machines" are formed within the executive branch, and the "machines" themselves are quite stable. Thus, mobilization of such "machines" does not require either long training or extraordinary abilities from new leaders.

DE Norway; islands of the Atlantic Ocean; Iceland; Old Norse system of
   spatial orientation
AB In the course of this study of the principles of spatial orientation of medieval Scandinavians reflected in the monuments of Old Norse Icelandic literature, I refer to the position of Iceland in the four-part world circle and discover that Iceland per se found itself outside the traditional north-Germanic world circle (kringla heimsins) which the settlers had arrived from (movement from the former world circle to Iceland was described in the sources not as to the British Isles with the term vestr westward, but tit out, towards the outer side). This indicates the existence of such spatial ideas long before the discovery of Iceland. This picture of the world was, no doubt, introduced in the ninth century to Iceland, which resulted in the fact that in 965 the country was divided into the four Quarters named after the four cardinal points. However, settlement of the island resulted in the creation of a new world. Along with the creation of new social, legal and political orders, a new state and a new people, its residents formed their own world circle in which Iceland occupied the central position, with Norway and the British Isles to the east. Stories about people who had come to Iceland from the British Isles vestan from the west are likely to be based on a very old oral tradition that was formed at a time when these saga characters had just left their homes on the islands labelled in the old system as VestrIond. The old north-Germanic and the new Icelandic world circles meet in the saga texts, which might mean their coexistence in real life. Thus, we achieve a glimpse of the literarization of old traditions and gain extra insight into the process of formation of Icelandic national identity.

AB Proceeding from materials relating to the "Time of Troubles", this article examines the phenomenon of imposture (samozvanchestvo) as one of the symbols of Russian political history from the early 17th to the mid-19th century. The duration of the "impostor epidemic" coincides exactly with that of serfdom, and imposture itself can be described as a social reaction to a form of authority founded on total personal dependence. The article aims to develop further Boris Uspenskij's argument that reveals in sacralization of the Tsar's power in medieval Russia the main reason of imposture. Rene Girard's conception of mimetic desire serves as the theoretical perspective for such a development.

AB The paper puts forward a hypothesis that it is distribution of social statuses that sets criteria for what is rational in social reality. The corporation views as reasonable something that contributes to its expansion into the semantic space of the society as a whole, and deems unreasonable something that prevents such expansion. At an individual's level, reasonable is something that contributes to one's attainment of social status. To support his statement in more details, K.Koktysh refers to the analysis of the formation and transformation of the languages of Political Science because it is Political Science that from the moment if its inception claimed to determine whether this or the other knowledge can be viewed as rational, either legitimizing its introduction into the social structure, or, on the contrary, declaring it a prejudice. The history of Europe has witnessed several such languages that replaced one another. In the concluding part of the article published in this issue (for the first three parts see Politeia, 2016, No 2, No 3 and No 4), the author analyzes the evolution of concepts in the epoch of Enlightenment.

AB The article describes the features of China's policy in the Arctic region, taking into account their relationship with the political and cultural traditions, which have a long history. Ambiguities in the assessments of intentions and prospects of China's policy in the Arctic is largely due underestimation of ties by the Western experts. The authors believe that the current China's foreign policy in general and toward the Arctic, in particular, is formed under the influence of such factors as the combination of "soft" and "hard" methods of management, existing sharp contradictions between the elites in the political leadership of the state, and the tradition of long-term planning in strategy. In accordance with this, the Arctic dimension of modern China foreign policy, seeks to achieve the strategic goal of access to the resources of the region in many directions simultaneously. The most important instruments include the revision of the legal status of the Arctic, an active part in the work of international organizations and active bilateral inter-state cooperation, avoiding open confrontation, "waiting" policy and incremental measures aimed at the gradual squeezing of competitors.

TI MOBILIZATION SCENARIOS OF DEVELOPMENT: ORIGINS AND CONSEQUENCES
SO TERRA ECONOMICUS
LA English
DT Article
DE mobilization of resources; planned economy; historical method;
   protectionism; monetary policy
AB The authors, offering mobilization scenarios for the development of the Russian economy, follow the historical method and propose to nationalize the key industries, restore the Soviet planned economy system and adopt some aspects of the German economy of the 1930s. Critics of this approach, however, highlight the incompatibility between the planned economy system and the private interest which drives investment and generates development. These researchers regard mobilization scenarios as asmokescreen for political agendas and a means of militarizing the economy. The author of the paper assumes that mobilization thinking was formed in the totalitarian society, under social inequality and the state's aggressive impact on public opinion. Accordingly, three sources of mobilization thinking can be identified: nationalism, social hierarchy, and the social consciousness aberration. Economic nationalism (or protectionism) appears in mobilization scenarios in the form of strict foreign exchange regulations and other isolationist policies. The paper shows that the lack of ethical principles can lead the proponents of nationalism to conclusions which are unacceptable from the conventional morality point of view. The deep-rooted ideas of inequality and superiority served as the second driver of mobilization thinking which rejects democracy and suggests a hierarchical system of social relationships. The social consciousness aberration is a product of the totalitarian society, where propaganda creates disrespect for the truth which invades science. The aberration comes in the shape of conspiracy theories, economic dogmatism and mythologization of history. Mobilization scenarios involve financial system reforms based on the practices of the Soviet and German prewar economies. The essence of the approach is to expand the use of directive methods and restrict financial markets, so that money and interest rate would become technical accounting indicators. The scenarios suggest directive methods of encouraging investment: setting differential lending rates, emitting "investment ruble", etc. Referring to the macroeconomic model of the "investment trap" and the history of voucher emission in Russia in the 1990s, the author demonstrates the method of creating " special assets" to be invalid.

   transformation
AB During the final stage of the Caucasian War, the Russian authorities conducted a complex of administrative and legal reforms aimed at the full integration of the North Caucasian societies into the political and legal space of the empire: the Caucasian line was liquidated, civilian regional government was created in 1860, and a system of military people's administration was formed. Its basis was the district management system, in which the leading role was played by the officers of the Caucasian army, who acted as administrators to regulate civil relations and heads of judicial institutions. In rural courts, the elected residents of the village conducted their case analysis, and in district and district courts - deputies from the mountain population, under the supervision of the district or district chief. In the field of legal proceedings, they relied on the norms of Russian law, the customary law of the mountaineers (adat) and sharia.
   This system was widely publicized in the press, analyzed by representatives of the administration, science and law. Representatives of liberal historiography gave the most accurate and adequate assessment of the changes. In their writings, as opposed to the work of the authors of the conservative movement, who enthusiastically covered all the actions of the Caucasian administration in the region, they offered the readers a critical analysis of the innovations. Having thoroughly studied the measures taken by the authorities to create new conditions for the life of mountain peoples, A.V. Komarov, V.B. Pfaf, N.F. Grabovsky, P.A. Burmensky and other representatives of the liberal trend of pre-revolutionary historiography, have revealed the positive and negative consequences of imperial modernization for the development of North Caucasian societies and their integration into Russia.

DT Article
DE European Union; migrant crisis; refugees; economic migrants; labour
   market; Schengen Area; resettlement quotas
AB The article reviews changes in migration policy of different European countries as a response to the ongoing refugee crisis. The case study of Greece, Hungary, Germany, Sweden and several other countries located along the so-called Eastern Mediterranean migration route shows that the problems they face, as well as their solutions, vary significantly. These distinctions are caused by a number of factors, such as geographical positions of recipient countries, their demand for new labour force, institutional frameworks and historically developed models of immigrant integration. Transition to the much-needed European migration strategy is impossible without finding a common ground on a number of fundamental issues, including introduction of resettlement quotas, border closings, social benefits to migrants and many other. At the same time, serious contradictions are also observed at the national level. In Sweden, the government changes its refugee admission policy, hastily adopting laws aimed at limiting the influx of migrants. The Greek authorities, which for a long time underestimated the crisis considering that most migrants regarded Greece only as a transit country, after Macedonia's decision to close its southern borders had to redefine their approaches and appeal to the principle of European solidarity. Considerable contradictions are observed in France which, on the one hand, shows discontent with resettlement quotas, but on the other hand, calls for a more equitable distribution of migrants arriving in Europe. Fluctuations in migration policies at the national level in many respects are caused by the public discontent over the level of immigration and extra expenditure on migration-related issues at the age of austerity. All aforementioned countries demonstrated the growing influence of nationalist and right-wing political forces calling for a more restrictive migration policy. As a result, the national governments in order to retain their public support have to introduce tough measures that undermine supranational level decisions.

   heritage; the social contract; separations and balances branches of the

AB This article analyzes the conceptual influence of the political parties of the English revolution of the middle of the 17th century that made up an arsenal of groups (independents, levellers, republicans) on the ideologists of political parties of the Tories and Whigs during the Stuart Restoration and early Enlightenment. The idea of the divine origin of Royal power became.entral in early Tory ideology. Many of them defended the absolute, unlimited form of the monarchy. More complex were the origins of the ideology of the opposition. Early Whigs borrowed the main ideas first and foremost in the arsenal of so-called "silk" independents. Opposed to absolute monarchy, Whigs denied the divine origin of Royal power. Their ideologues advocated a constitutional monarchy. Most Whigs saw the possibility of limiting Royal power through the law. They allotted to Parliament the crucial role in constitutional monarchy. Early parties were spokesmen for the ideology of the new bourgeois classes of society which had begun to take shape after the revolution of the mid 17th century. The Tories rejected any attempts to modify the existing form of government, because only monarchy was fully meet their requirements. Whigs, expressing the interests of the bourgeoisie and the new nobility, fought against absolutism, not intending, however, to abolish the Royal authority. The main ideas from the arsenal of the revolutionaries was later adopted by the ideologues of political parties in the age of Enlightenment, though enlightenment had condemned the revolution and has been at pains to deny any continuity or connection with the levellers, the independents and their followers from the Restoration period. Theories of social contract, constitutional monarchy, separations and balances branches of the power, resistance to tyranny, protection of private property, personal and civil liberties, were not only included in the arsenal of early political parties of the 17-18th centuries but also formed the basis for a model of liberal democracy which was to become widespread in the modern world. Thus the influence of the English revolution of the middle of the 17th century in the ideological plan was more significant and long-term, than the Glorious Revolution of 1688-1689. Refs 21.

AB Alexandr Zhelezniakov's "Mongolian Civilization: History and Modernity. Theoretical Justification of the Atlas," based on the achievements of modern civilization theory, offers a concept for the development of the Atlas of Mongolian civilization. The work uses extensive theoretical and factual material, revealing the features of the identification and development of Mongolia as the core of the civilization of Inner Asia (Mongolian civilization) with ancient and rich history and culture. The author successively reveals the phases of development of the Mongolian civilization on the way to the modern "breakdown" and the transition to a new phase - the acquisition of Mongolia's political and economic independence, civilizational identification, and positioning in a complex and contradictory world order. The author of the monograph not only characterized the potential of the Mongolian civilization on the way to becoming a pole of a new world order, but also proposed a new methodological approach at the intersection of civilization theory and geopolitics. For the first time in studying the problems of world politics, the researcher posed topical issues of self-identification in the world historical process of local civilizations that overlap each other with their orbits. The monograph represents Mongolia as a pole of the civilization of Inner Asia, which is in interaction with the European, Russian, Chinese, Hindu and Islamic civilizations, which is included in the orbits of all foreign policy poles of world influence, but is not dissolved in them. The monograph gives a theoretical background for the creation of a system of maps integrated in the Atlas of the Mongolian civilization.

DT Article
DE Asia-Pacific region; the United States; China; the San Francisco System;
   security; balance of power; balancing; hedging
AB The U.S.-led alliances in the Asia-Pacific, also known as the San Francisco System, serve as a foundation of America's political-military hegemony in this region as well as one of its global primacy pillars. Yet, the future of the System is uncertain. It faces the biggest challenge since its establishment in the early 1950s, the chief reason being the changing balance of power between the United States and China. Washington expects that the logic of balancing will be pushing its Asian allies and partners, wary of a rising China, closer to the United States. Japan and Australia are currently the American allies most engaged in anti-China balancing. Beijing's strategy appears to be aimed at neutralizing the U.S. alliances so that they cease containing China and show deference to its security interests. Thailand, South Korea and Taiwan have been the most pronounced cases of neutralization. Caught between the intensifying Sino-American competition, most Southeast Asian states have chosen the path of hedging, seeking to diversify their strategic links and maximize space for maneuver. Among the U.S. allies in Asia, Singapore has been the most skilful practitioner of hedging, while the Philippines under Rodrigo Duterte has become another prominent case of the hedging strategy. The combination of neutralization and hedging may prove the best solution to the Asia-Pacific's security dilemma, as it allows China to satisfy its basic security concerns while sparing its East Asian neighbors the fate of becoming frontline states in the U.S. - China strategic rivalry. The ongoing tendencies towards neutralization and hedging are generally consistent with Russia's interests. The key East Asian countries leaving Washington's sphere of political-military influence will weaken America's regional and global hegemony, thus contributing to the formation of polycentric world order. Moreover, the desire of a number of East Asian states to hedge their bets and diversify strategic relationships gives Russia more opportunities to raise its profile in the region.

AB The article is devoted to the topic insufficiently developed in the national historiography, particularly in regard to its regional aspect. The study was conducted on materials of the State archive of the Sverdlovsk region and the Centre of documentation of public organizations of Sverdlovsk region with the assistance of the scientific and publicistic literature. The topic urgency is determined by its high relevance for the social sciences, especially history, sociology and political science. Scientific novelty of the work is seen in the fact that the new materials discovered by the author in these archives are introduced into scientific usage. The research proves that the labour legislation in the USSR was, in fact, punitive. It is argued that the whole history of the Communist regime in our country is the history of the administrative-forced labour of the Soviet people. It is declared that in the Soviet period of history, until the beginning of "perestroika," any research of problems of administrative coercion in the USSR was impossible. It is emphasized that almost until the last days of the Soviet Union the evasion of citizens from "socially useful work" in any case was regarded as a serious violation of the law and was strongly pursued, either by measures of societal impact or by the application of criminal law. It is proved that the leadership of the Communist party and the state considered repressive labour as a precondition for normal functioning and strengthening of the regime, as a permanent tool for strengthening their own power and, ultimately, as a natural law of the socialist construction."

AB Based on the materials of six waves of nationwide representative sociological monitoring by institute of Sociology RAS, in 2014-2017, changes in the everyday life of Russians due to the recent economic crisis are defined and adaptation strategies of population to the new economic conditions are analyzed. It is shown that the impact of the crisis on the lives of Russians is gradually decreasing, although the past two and a half years have already brought significant qualitative changes to it. These changes comprise not only material well-being, but general perception of life, hopes and expectations. A significant proportion of the population is forced to use different types of practices to improve their material well-being, but this is due not so much to the impact of the crisis in the moment, but rather to the realization that the changes taking place are not of a short-term nature. The main mechanisms for adaptation to the new economic conditions among Russians is economy and the reduction of expenditures (seriously affecting investments in human capital) and the use of subsidiary farming - traditional response of population to deterioration of economic conditions. Data on the socio-psychological state and expectations about material situation show that Russians are getting used to the new reality, but this cannot be considered to result from effective adaptation strategies related to the development of human capital, active labor market actions, new practices in financial behavior, etc., that could lay the foundation for further sustainable development of the country - the crisis did not act as the catalyst for development and dissemination of such strategies.

AB Due to ongoing partial demise and transformations of nation-states, the cities and urban networks which were constitutive for political and economic order of the early Modernity restore themselves as an important element of global or late Modernity institutional system. Significant trends of global development, social institutes and images of the future within the centre-periphery model are rather determined by political, economic and cultural realities of urban networks than that of nation-states. At the same time, an urban network is constituted as an aggregation of places which accumulate achievements and disadvantages of globalization that distributes megapolises not only as nodes of a network, but also as levels in hierarchical spaces. On the one hand, post-industrial global cities concentrate the creative class, world finances, expertise and governance that enables them to determine priorities of social development. But the degree of their emancipation from national contexts has limits due to their focus on organizing and supporting financial, information and service segments of the global market. Start requirements to become a part of this network are unachievable for the majority of urban centers in the world. They face different problems related to agendas of survival, modernization and diversification of major enterprises and economic branches. On the other hand, both the biggest and growing megapolises of the capitalist world-system periphery and industrial cities of its centre demonstrate enlargement without development and accumulate unsolved social problems. The article posits that within a growing hierarchization and differentiation of the world urban networks which distribute advantages in the cities of post-industrial core and allocate disadvantages in periphery, the new development factor is delegation of resources, functions and responsibility from nation-states to the level of big cities and urban networks. It is proposed that the increase of an urban autonomy will raise the effectiveness of the urban development daily problems solution, given that cities have a richer potential to become successful locomotives of development than nation-states and their agents.

AB The political order of Modernity has undergone a number of significant transformations due to the dynamics of the structure of the modern society, which changes its perception of a majority as an ontological basis of this political project. Majority has never been statistical. Rather, it has always been constructed on purpose by the leading political figures within the collective imagination of a society, being the subject of a dynamic consensus. The article discusses several historical constellations of a majority within the changing structure of the society of the Modernity, analyzes their strengthening and weakening factors. According to V.Martianov's conclusion, the global political order is gradually losing the need to rely upon once-sacred concept of the will of the majority in order to be legitimate, which creates conditions for the establishment of non-democratic ways of legitimation.

DT Article
DE Historical memory; feature films; historical myth; revolutionary myth;
   stages of formation; structure and images of the historical myth
AB Professional community of historians grows ever more interested in feature films as a historical source. Reflecting reality in designed images, films can provide reliable information concerning not only facts of consciousness and conduct, but also past events as transformed in the representation of film producers. There are several ways, in which reality is reflected in cinema: documentary, realistic, fantasy, romantic, etc. It is the mythological one that holds a special place, and is often associated with accomplishment of propaganda objectives and historical memory construction. In a point of fact, all these functions were performed by early Soviet films that were to promote new socialist values and those of communist education. The article examines the role of Soviet cinema in constructing Soviet historical myth, including the myth of revolutionary "creation." This latter one lies in the core of the mythological cycle including cosmogonic, etiological (myths of transfiguration) and eschatological (myths of the end of days) myths, as well as the "myth of the golden age." Taken together, they form a mythological picture of past, present and future. Drawing on genre and thematic analysis of the 1917-1953 films, the author identifies main stages in the construction of the Soviet historical myth, determines its image-structure and traces the transformation of the images under the influence of political and ideological processes in the Soviet society. Feature films of the historical-revolutionary genre produced in the USSR in 1917-1953 are studied as a historical source. In total, about 100 films have been analyzed, 18 of which are devoted to the events of 1917. The author identifies the more significant works, that have determined visual imagery and interpretative approaches to the characterization of the events of October 1917.

   of China; Silk Road Economic Belt; foreign policy; globalization;

AB The upcoming 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, which will be held in autumn 2017, has a significant impact on China's policy. Xi Jinping tries to use this period of time for further consolidation of political and military power to strengthen his positions. The paper highlights three main trends taking place in internal political sphere of China: an informal discussion on limiting the maximum age of Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China, the question if Xi will stay for his third term in 2022, and what arrangement of the new Politburo will be. In terms of world economy, P.R.C. has sent a signal that Beijing is going to become a leader of globalization. On the World Economic Forum in January 2017, Xi offered to international community a strategy of "inclusive globalization", which will be against protectionism. At the same time, the strategic vulnerability of Beijing to the Taiwan factor appeared in a new light after Donald Trump had said that "One-China policy is negotiable". Thus, there is a contradictory situation where China, on the one hand, needs a global partnership with the United States to implement its new role of the globalization leader, but, on the other, Beijing does not want to have a drastic deterioration in relations with Washington if Trump would depart from the "One-China" principle. P.R.C. seeks to demonstrate its willingness to become a leader in world economy and financial sphere through the mechanisms of The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and other platforms and strategies, such as the Silk Road Fund, BRICS Development Bank, etc. But, nevertheless, it is important to stress that by 2020, China will need to develop and test new mechanisms of national macroeconomic management, which can be effectively used in most open economies. In terms of foreign and defense policy, P.R.C. applies the tactics of "rigidity and compromise" - a new version of the "carrot and stick" policy. On the one part, Xi uses the tools of rigidity to defend China's "national interests", on the other, he proposes compromise solutions to his friends and competitors in addressing disputes and overcoming different understandings. Strategically speaking, Russia is interested to cooperate with China in economic sphere, G-20, military and political fields. However, it needs to conduct smart and responsible policy not to become a player number two in Russian-Chinese relations.

AB According to the author, Russian workers before 1917 did not form a class and did not possess a proletarian socialist ideology. They took an active part in the revolutionary movement and in the overthrow of the monarchy, but not because of their revolutionary character, their organization, or their awareness. Main reason for their increased revolutionism was the fact that they were semiliterate, the most demographically disadvantaged, the most marginal, and the most frustrated and criminogenic social group of the Imperial Russian population, and they were prone for these reasons to radicalism, aggressiveness, deviation, and manipulation. The radicalism and aggressiveness of the proletariat was echoed in the Social-Democratic program, the most radical and aggressive of all the political programs. Simple and understandable slogans and skillful propaganda ensured the success of the Bolsheviks in the proletarian context, and their large-scale, skilled organizational work allowed them to mobilize the proletariat and direct its energy into the necessary channels - for use as cannon fodder for the revolution.

AB This article considers the development of integration between Russia's Kaliningrad region and Poland's northeastern voivodeships in 1946-2016. The authors set out to identify the main results of Russian-Polish cross-border cooperation in the context of the changing historical and political paradigms in the Baltic region. The authors conduct a brief historical analysis of this sphere of international relations. The genesis of integration at the regional level is explored by identifying the major areas and tools for collaboration. The authors address research works of Russian (Soviet) and Polish researchers, intergovernmental agreements, EU-Russia crossborder cooperation programmes, expert interviews, and relevant analytical reports. Special attention is paid to programme-based interregional and cross-border cooperation as the most efficient form of collaboration for accelerating integration and socioeconomic development in border areas. Based on their evaluation of the major achievements, the authors conclude that Russian-Polish cross-border cooperation has been successful. Yet, there is a need for developing a long-term empirical model of Russian-Polish relations in view of the many-years' collaboration between the Kaliningrad region and the Polish voivode-ships.

DE New Social Reality; Networking Mechanisms of Identity Formation; Network
   Topos-Structuring; Public Crowdsourcing
AB The authors prove and describe the action of new networking mechanisms of formation of identities which arise in the context of societal transformations of the modern society. The networking mechanisms of identity formation represent a complex of interrelated and interdependent practices in global information and communication space, promoting individual and collective identification, interiorization and reflection. The complex includes the mechanism of network communication, mechanism of reflexive involvement of a person into the public space, mechanism of network topos-structuring and mechanism of public crowdsourcing. The results of the empirical research show that the functionality of the mechanism of network communication for reproducing/positioning traditional identities and projecting new identities resides in its digital nature (readiness and openness for changes) and a network ethos (orientation to the integration into the community of different value orientations and statuses of actors and provision of cooperation between them on the basis of the development of the uniform complex of values and standards). The mechanism of reflexive involvement of individuals into the public space enables individual and collective actors to project the independent social worlds requiring the creation of their own virtualized public spaces that are closely linked with the common social space. The mechanism of network toposstructuring and mechanism of public crowdsourcing, forming situation and problem identities, have the high mobilization potential to update the activity of network communities in the form of individuals' initiatives and large-scale civil movements where new sustained identities form which can also gain the protest nature. The authors come to conclusion that the complex of network mechanisms produces the dynamic matrix of the identity of a modern person allowing to take the opportunities for its development in the contemporary conditions of new social reality formation. At the same time, the complex of networking mechanisms is not stable; its content depends on those institutional practices which determine further conditions, processes and results of formation of identities, requiring their conceptual understanding and empirical research in social sciences.

   opportunities; public health
ID RESPONSIBILITY
AB This review considers contemporary approaches to social justice in healthcare, which revolve around two main discourses: the idea of individual responsibility and idea of equality. Questions on the interrelation between individual responsibility and social factors are fundamental for contemporary social theories of justice in healthcare. Equality can be understood as economic in nature, as about opportunities, as well as the equality of freedoms. This review analyses the antagonism between approaches of social determinants of health and health as an individual responsibility. Providing medical services depending on personal responsibility for her/his health can increase risks for those who already in negative conditions. The social determinants of health include everyday life conditions, the possibilities for satisfying material needs, the environment and also social, economic and political norms. They are formed by policy, distribution of finance, power and other resources in global, national and local levels, all of which form the main factors of injustice. If social justice is understood in terms of capacities (in the case of health care, we can see it as capacities to offer equal rights in healthcare provision), then healthcare is an imperative equal to social justice. The provision of social justice in health is considered a significant social, economic, ethical and political issue. Therefore, it can be addressed only from an interdisciplinary approach. Recognition of the social factors behind healthcare and necessity of overcoming unfair gaps in health at the international level makes the research of social justice in health and personal responsibility vital.

SO POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE political system; electoral process; effective number of parties;
   democracy; political regime; party system
AB The article focuses on the parliamentary election results at both federal and regional levels (2003-2016). The research is based upon the index of the effective number of parties (the Laakso-Taagepera index and Golosov index) and proposes that these indices demonstrate a certain extent of political and electoral competitiveness. For the period under review authors distinguish 4 consequent stages, which reflect trends in Russian electoral competition. After the adoption of amendments, which tightened Russia's electoral law, the electoral landscape transformed gradually from high levels of representativeness to limitation of inter-party competition through periods of "forced partization" and liberalization of electoral law. At the current stage (2013-2017) the system seeks to follow a tendency towards controlled competition. Thus, a relatively large number of parties take part in election (for instance, eleven parties were registered to participate in the 2016 election to the State Duma), but can't provide competition to the ruling party. Based on statistics for regional parliamentary elections, only the Republic of Karelia has demonstrated more or less competitive situation. It is also confirmed by the effective number of parties index, which at the last election (2016) amounted to 3,76. In general, despite the existing partial frauds in the election results, the analysis of electoral statistics allows to build a so-called "electoral portrait" that takes into account the medium-and long-term tendencies of the electoral process and, above all, the consequences of reforms in the respective field of legislation.

DE French expedition to Egypt 1798-1801; invasion to Algeria in 1830;
   Algerian question; colonialism
AB The article is dedicated to the parallels between the Egyptian campaign of Napoleon Bonaparte (1798-1801) and the French invasion to Algeria in 1830, to the comparison of French policy in Egypt and Algeria. The study shows how the experience of the Egyptian campaign was rethought during the African campaign. By analyzing the administrative and religious policies of the French administration and their propaganda, the author comes to the conclusion that both campaigns were inextricably linked: both of them were the result of the development of the Enlightenment ideas of the civilization superiority of Europe. The Egyptian campaign in a certain way served as a matrix for the invasion to Algeria in 1830, although not all of its experience was adopted and even could be adopted because of different political circumstances and the specifics of the objects of the conquest.

ID METABOLIC RIFT
AB The article is devoted to the formation of the American Environmentalism as a philosophic school and a political ideology from the latter half of the 19th century until today. The author follows the genesis of its three major directions - the Conservationist Movement, Preservationism and Greenism - which gradually developed into the single "Green" ideology that has been influencing the state environmental policy intrinsically since the end of the 19th century. In the course of rapid economic development, especially after the World War II, the "Limits to Growth" concept captured the consciousness of the American society as ordinary people became aware of multiple environmental disasters inevitably resulting from industrial growth - not only the traditional need to preserve wild nature and protect endangered species, but also the necessity to control the cleanness of air, water and soils, to monitor a radiation level, to securely dispose hard waste in big amounts, to remove ramifications of chemicals use in agriculture and in households, etc. Although the Conservationist philosophy (meaning merely a conservation of nature and natural resources for present and future generations) remains the core of the "Green" ideology in the U.S. up to the present day, many other allied concepts were emerging or restored during the 20th century, such as the Malthusianism (in form of Neo-Malthusianism), New Environmentalism, Eco-Sociology, Eco-Marxism, Free Market Environmentalism, Evangelical Environmentalism, Radical Environmentalism, Ecological Anarchism, Post-Environmentalism and other. Some of these approaches lay emphasis rather on social problems connected with destruction of the environment, other deal more with environmental issues themselves. Generally, the American Environmentalism in its modern state is regarded by its adepts as an insufficient political ideology deprived of an essential power to solve new environmental problems or effectively influence state policy in present-day conditions. It seems to have reached its limits, and needs to transform into a new political ideology relevant to realities of the 21st century.

TI DYNASTIC MARRIAGE OF MAMLUK SULTAN OF EGYPT AL-NASIR AND PRINCESS

LA Russian
DT Article
DE history; Golden Horde; Egypt; dynastic marriage; Mamluks; al-Nasir;
   Tulunbay; Middle Ages; Arab chronicles
AB Objective: to identify the main reasons for the dynastic marriage between Mamluk Sultan al-Nasir and the Chinggisid princess Tulunbay and to analyze the impact of the termination of the marriage, according to medieval Arab chronicles.
   Research materials: medieval Arab chronicles of Mamluk authors: Ibn Duqmaq, al-Qalqashandi, al-Maqrizi, Mogultay, al-Nuwayri, Ibn Tagriberdi, al-Ayni et al.
   Results and novelty of the research: diplomatic relations between Egypt and the Golden Horde were the result of economic and foreign policy objectives of both states. Egypt at that time was one of the most powerful and influential states in the Muslim East, which showed an increased interest in events in the Golden Horde. This interest was stimulated by the fact that the Golden Horde was involved in the orbit of Islam and began to more intensively integrate Islam into the everyday culture of the Golden Horde society. After the Golden Horde had strengthened its position during the reign of khan Uzbek, Mamluk sultans began to consolidate even more their relations with the Golden Horde. One of the most important steps for the rapprochement between the two countries was a dynastic marriage between Mamluk Sultan al-Nasir and the Chinggisid princess Tulunbay. The object of this study is relevant, since the issue of political significance of dynastic relations between Mamluk and the Golden Horde rulers remain understudied. Meanwhile, the dynastic marriage is presented as a political act: as an expression of the good will of the state in relation to the other and a way to strengthen the influence of one country on another. The novelty of this research lies in the fact that, along with a detailed analysis of the Arab chronicles' information on this subject, it presents for the first time the tomb of princess Tulunbay, which has been preserved in Egypt.

TI DREAMING OF THE ANTI IMPERIAL: IVAN EFREMOV IN SEARCH OF A "THIRD WAY"
SO AB IMPERIO-STUDIES OF NEW IMPERIAL HISTORY AND NATIONALISM IN THE
   POST-SOVIET SPACE
LA Russian
DT Article
AB The article discusses the literary works of Ivan Antonovich Efremov (1908-1972) as a manifestation of a particular worldview: the " third path" between the Stalinist version of Communism and European Liberalism, a postimperial yet not postcolonial utopian vision of the single and allembracing egalitarian society of the future.
   A renowned paleontologist, Efremov is best known as a leading Soviet science fiction writer, author of the utopian novel The Andromeda Nebula (1957), the anti-utopian The Hour of the Bull (1968), as well as a number of historical novels. The author argues that these texts contain a hidden transcript of Efremov's sociopolitical views, which are virtually impossible to detect in his personal papers. He destroyed most of his archive in the 1930s out of the fear of arrest, and heavily censored his personal correspondence thereafter. As a result, Efremov's fiction remains the only elaborated authentic form of expression of his ideas. The author argues that these ideas had been formed in the 1920s and reflected the ambivalent intellectual climate of the epoch, in which mysticism coexisted with revolutionary utopianism and anti-Semitism with internationalism.
   Efremov's sociophilosophical views were equally contradictory, reflecting influences of social utopianism and eugenics, mystical anarchism and theosophy, scientism and Buddhism. His egalitarian-utopian ideal, bizarrely united with Nietzscheanism, gave birth to a peculiar dream of " anti-empire," a community of intellectually, morally, and physically exceptional superhumans, eager to help weaker individuals and communities to rise to their level. Such an ideal was formed during the Thaw as an antithesis to Stalinism. By the mid-1960s, it became clear that this ideal could not be articulated by means of any of the main ideological currents in the Soviet society, while at the same time it shared elements with all of them. Efremov's holism and contempt for individual or group autonomy as well as for consumerism resonated with Stalinism and Soviet statism, Russian nationalism and antiSemitism. At the same time, his strong condemnation of state coercion, censorship of sexuality, and individualism brought him closer to liberals. The result was Efremov's complicated relations with all the main Soviet "parties" of the 1960s, and his growing rapprochement (partly for pragmatic reasons) with some of the leaders of the emerging "Russian party." These political ties heavily affected attitudes toward Efremov's literary works after his death, as rightist politicians and publicists began claiming the legacy of this unconventional communist thinker.

AB The paper provides an attempt of a comprehensive reconstruction of the absolute chronology of Rurikid' polity in the first half of the 10th century, its historical geography and territorial organization during this period. Separately, is made an attempt to recreate the model of the social structure of communities of Rus' in the first half - the middle of the 10th century by simultaneous written sources in a comparison with the data of first Russian chronicles.
   The paper substantiates that the Rurikid's polity was created in the half a century between the conventional 910 and 960 years. Geographically this polity consisted of two of nuclear territories - the << southern >> around Kiev and the << northern >> around Novgorod, around which had been formed the zones for racketeering by Rus'. Rus' was quite homogeneous society in which varied hereditary and acquired individual status, but had not yet been established rigid social hierarchy. It was a militant political community with a hereditary position of its leader (ruler). By the middle of the 10th century there was an allocation of the princely family of Rurikids as a conical ruling clan.

DT Article
DE migration crisis as a tip of complicated problems; Ukrainian crisis and
   a backward turn in Europe-Russia relations; assailable elements of the
   European Union; Brexit; political devolution in Poland and Hungary
AB Economic and political integration of European states has had its ups and downs. At present, the European Union has fallen into crisis, probably the most acute in history. Solution approaches to emerging problems are not clear. This creates excessive tensions and accelerates apprehensive attitudes. But the processes breaking out in Europe, which have already changed its layout, have objective reasons, and their main results are irreversible. The European societies are facing challenging but solvable problems. First of all, the EU is undergoing the most broad-scale migration crisis after the World War II. Actions taken are at best able to alleviate the acuteness of the situation, but are unlikely to bring a working solution in the long run. On the one hand, Europe can neither cut itself off the increasing influx of the foreign culture, nor absorb it or assure the conflict free coexistence between migrants and the native population. On the other hand, the aggressive rejection of migrants by nationalist and racist groups constitutes a big danger. In whole, all this makes a grim social cocktail which threatens the European democracy and solidarity. Acute contradictions between the former USSR and European countries are based on their own history. Since the times of restructuring in the USSR, the concept of an expected serious turn in relations between Russia and the West once for all has been forming. However, now the falseness of it became obvious. Not even a satisfactory solution of one utterly acute Ukrainian crisis is forthcoming. And it may be followed by other crises. Assailable elements became apparent also in the EU itself. The highest contradictions point here was the Brexit - the referendum where the British people have by a small majority taken an unprecedented decision of leaving the EU. The European democracy is greatly endangered by bursts of nationalism, radical populism and social aggression in some EU states (Poland and especially Hungary). The European societies and politicians are to give an answer which way the fundamentals of the EU integration and the European civilization itself may and must be protected in the face of the modern world's severe challenges.

DE February revolution; liberalism; press; Provisional government
AB The article is devoted to the evolution of liberal points of view on the political process in February October 1917. The liberal positions changed so fast and dramatically that it is possible to stress the fact of the transformation of their programmes and tactics within the few months. The significance of the main categories of the political life (for example, "democracy", "revolution", "government", "socialism" etc.) changed in their texts, too. Mainly the periodical press was used as a historical source. Because of these texts the authors made a conclusion that at the time of the revolution liberals did not make an agenda but reacted on the conjunctures that actually did not depend on them. It was a cause of the gradually loss of their influence on the political process in Russia. Trying to adjust their views to the revolution conditions liberal parties and liberal politicians certainly kept unconventionally thinking, analytical interpreting the actual problems but in fact they lost the political subjectivity.

DE psychological status of the society; images of authority and leaders;

ID POLITICAL PERCEPTION
AB Paper presents the data from the study of psychological status of Russian society. As the study has shown a number of psychological parameters (concepts of justice, some political values, the level of influence of President Putin in public mentality) preserves rather consistent for a long time. Other indicators are transformed substantially under the influence of some factors including elections. Inertial character of the last elections gave tactical victory for authorities but caused political demobilization of Russian society. Respodents' images of Prime Minister, Presidential Administration, State Duma, governors, municipal power, courts, procurators and political parties substantially declined after 2016 elections. At the same time one could see the increase of the influence of the Council of Federation, security agencies and intelligence service. It also should be noticed that a radical views substantially declined as the conservative trend increased. It means that success of the United Russia was proved. At the same time one can speak about a clear growth of the left moods as the growth of the socialist and communist ideas was fixed in this study. Elections improved the image of authorities: respondents evaluate them more positively now. There is a new trend of decline of traditionally personified images of authority and the growth of the influence of political parties and groups though all the parties have lost their influence. One can suggest that citizens got used to this party system. The demand to have a formal party representation proves that values of formal democracy have been rooted in mass mentality.

DE Karl F. German; Carl Teodor Hermann; Academy of Sciences; the History of

AB In the first half of the XIX century, Russian statistics took shape both institutionally and theoretically. One of the central figures in this process was Karl Fedorovich German (Carl Teodor Hermann) whose writing and organizational work significantly influenced the next generation of statisticians. K. F. German graduated from the University of Gottengen in 1791. Upon his arrival to Russia in 1795, he made a successful career in Russian science. He was elected as associate member of the Academy of Sciences in 1810 and was granted the full membership in 1835. In 1819, he was appointed Full Professor of Statistics in St. Petersburg University. From 1811 up to 1835, he was the Head of the Fist Central Organization of the Russian Administrative Statistics, which was attached as the Statistical Department to the Ministry of Police and later to the Ministry of the Interior and was established for collection and publication of statistical data and periodical reports.
   In his theoretical work, German was influenced by G. Achenwall - the most prominent German "university statistician". He located statistics within political sciences, declared that "statistics form the focal point for all political sciences. It provides the evidence for all these sciences, and therefore the foundations of these sciences should develop according to the needs of statistics". In his lectures, German taught that autocracy became a source of evil and led to despotism, and the social contract should be made to benefit the majority rather than enslave them. German was close to the Decembrists' movement, lectured privately to the members on this movement in 1816-1817. His liberal optimistic view was shattered when he was compelled to leave the University in 1824 and was forbidden to lecture. German's works and activities have had a most profound influence on the development of the Russian science and governmental statistics.

AB Soviet sociology was legitimized and partially institutionalized during the period of thaw when USSR positions itself as modernized industrial socialist society. Political and ideological intentions of Soviet sociological project were manifest. Under rigid party-state control, this realm of knowledge production had to balance between the ethos of science and the ethos of ideology. The consequences of such a situation were negative for sociologists and sociology. Nonetheless, serious professional achievements were made by the pioneer Soviet sociologists who enthusiastically used the opportunities for scholarly community building and achieved empirical results. The second wave of sociological enthusiasm swept down with the Perestroika politics of glasnost and democratization and its aftermaths.

AB The author attempts to prove that, along with the well-known major paths of development (revolutionary and evolutionary), there is another specific way of development -the one of a "trauma society". It is shown that the notion of "trauma' has acquired social significance as it was comprehended in the philosophical, psychological, sociological and political science literature. The author considers "trauma societies" to be the countries that have been experiencing stagnation in development for a long time or are in a recession, losing their previous achievements. The article reveals the essential characteristics of 'trauma society", its causes, consequences of its development. Particular attention is paid to Russia, which, according to the author, can be attributed to the "trauma societies", since it rejected the socialist past while failing to achieve the goals it set and, at the same time, losing faith in the values that underpinned this transition in the first place. The author points out that no society (and Russia is no exception) can be traumatized forever, hence he attempts to forecast the circumstances under which it could recover from the trauma and analyzes the obstacles to the transition to a truly democratic, well-functioning society, yet not overcome. As a result, the author outlines the strategic concepts of Russia's development.

ID VOTING-BEHAVIOR; ELECTIONS; INFORMATION; CONTESTS; DECISION; SENATE
AB The article is devoted to the comprehensive analysis of the vote factors. In the first part the author analyzes the current scientific understanding of the vote conditions. Initially, all the conditions of electoral choice are divided into external (contextual) and internal (direct). The electoral and party system, as well as the distinct characteristics of political regime are highlighted among the external conditions of voting. These conditions determine the set of available alternatives to the electoral choice. Internal factors of voting are divided into long-term and short-term. Group affiliation, partisanship and ideological identification are treated as long-term factors of voting. Voters' positions on policy issues, evaluations of government performance, perceptions of the candidates' personal qualities, information activities during the election campaign, emotions and cognitive heuristics are considered as short-term factors of voting. In the second part of the paper the author discusses some problems of studying the vote factors. The author concludes that the scientific understandings of the hierarchy of the vote factors, as well as on the procedure of the impact of these factors on the voters are extremely contradictory. To overcome the situation of uncertainty in the field of electoral research the author offers to pay attention to the problem of the heterogeneity of the vote. In conclusion an exemplary program of empirical research is formulated, focused on the development of scientific ideas about the electoral choice.

ID ELECTORAL SYSTEMS
AB This article speaks to methodological aspects of the ways to use a popular research technique -process tracing. The latter has gained momentum as a compromise between neo-positivist and interpretative approaches. Authors provide a brief overview of the method's role in current political research; carefully describe the peculiarities of method's procedure; compare process tracing with other research tools and discuss its advantages and shortcomings. Process tracing is a type of within-case analysis that aims at inferring causal mechanisms that bring about outcomes in question. The main strengths of the approach are 1) possibility of falsification tests, 2) rigor of analytical procedure, based on Bayesian logic and related empirical tests, 3) getting the most of in-depth knowledge of the case, 4) compatibility with quantitative research as the auxiliary method. Apart from that, process tracing serves as a powerful remedy against a-theoretical narratives and turns the case study into a genuinely captivating detective storyline. Among the weak points one should mention 1) lack of parsimonial explanations, 2) lack of generalizability, 3) time-consuming process of data collection. To demonstrate how process tracing can be used in real-world research the article provides one example based on study by Ahmed which devoted to electoral reforms in Europe at the end of the 19th century. It is shown how Ahmed based on process tracing falsified the influential theory by Rokkan-Boix and put forward the solid argument for her model of explaining the logic of electoral system reforms in Europe at the time of the franchise expanded.

AB The article shows which way the views on the first stage of the policy process, the agenda setting, have been developed in political science. The author discusses different approaches to the political agenda definition including governmental and decision agendas, systemic and institutional agendas, symbolic and substantial agendas. Different ways to indicate this kind of agenda focusing on parliamentary agenda are also highlighted. Examples of indicators used by political scientists include parliamentary questions, parliamentary debates or hearings, parliamentary inquiries and legislative initiatives. Moreover, this paper provides an overview of factors deemed to be the most important for the development of an agenda-setting research and the key direction of academic literature in this field. The article contains a critique of the main agenda-setting conceptual models. The current conceptual trends of this approach are outlined, which includes the break with American-based agenda-setting theory, the spread of comparative analysis, the development of quantitatively oriented policy methods, and the increase in policy dynamics research. The relationship between mass media and political agenda, political parties' influence on the political agenda are also highlighted in the latest empirical studies. Different viewpoints on the media impact are shown: media as a source of their own agenda, media as a resource for promotion of separate issues, and media as a tool of influence over the agendas of political actors. The results are based on an analysis of few research projects that were represented in Web of Science publications with the highest citation index. Publications were selected by using the topic "Agenda Setting" in the category "Political Science", without selection of a definite time period. Statistics of co-citation were analysed and a co-citation map was created by dint of the VOSviewer computer program.

AB E-participation is recognized as a key element of a modern democratic society development. Social networking is considered to make a positive effect on citizens' participation increase. In this paper, we describe the social network communities organized around the users, supporters or just interested in e-participation Russian citizens.
   For the research, the groups supporting e-participation portals at federal, regional, municipal levels have been selected in the Russian most popular social network VKontakte. The research was conducted with the use of web-crawler for an automated analysis of the social network communities. The following parameters of the social network groups have been analyzed: number of vertices and edges, density, diameter, medium degree, average length and modularity.
   The conducted research underlined that social network groups are organized around e-participation portals form the communities of users. However, these communities have a heterogenous structure. A high level of modularity has been found in all the studied communities, that detected an obvious users' clustering within the community. The study proved that groups in social networks provide opportunities for information sharing. The study revealed the following parameters that influence on information sharing and the secondary audience attraction: a number of community members, the frequency of posts, the modularity of interconnections between the reposters.

AB The paper uses the evidence from Russia to analyze the arrangements for interaction between foreign firms and key national partners in the countries of their operations. We identify the main stages and factors that were driving the evolution of the two main channels of collective action for foreign firms in Russia over the last 25 years - the Foreign Investment Advisory Council under the Office of the Russian Prime Minister and foreign business associations. We also provide the comparative analysis of the effectiveness of these two main channels, as well as highlight the factors contributing to higher effectiveness of individual foreign business associations under the current Russia's circumstances. We show that political rather than economic or institutional factors play a more significant role in explaining the changes in the effectiveness of collective efforts of foreign firms. Russia's experience suggests that the mechanisms of interaction between foreign business and the authorities can work effectively only if there is mutual interest in such interaction. In Russia since the mid-2000s there have been relatively favorable political conditions for the dialogue between the Government and foreign firms, and the respective interaction mechanisms produced some positive effects regarding e.g. attraction of additional foreign investment inflows and modernization of the regulatory framework. However, with worsening the political situation in 2013, political priorities of the Russian Government became markedly more important than the economic ones, and thus, the effectiveness of the existing instruments for collective action of foreign firms significantly decreased. One consequence of this has been the greater willingness of foreign business associations to cooperate with Russian business in order to promote jointly a pragmatic reform agenda.

AB Modern social and political as well as economic conditions create urban environment that is characterized by a high degree of professional dynamics, political instability and unpredictable future. It makes young people feel uncertain about their desired future and gives rise to groundless hope for random success [7]. The desired future is as a rule associated with employment that can provide a decent life for an individual. Ideas about decent life are changing in the course of time. However, its general understanding includes a prestigious (elite) profession, financial security, feeling of self-importance and comfort.
   A stable development of urban environment requires high dynamics of the professional activity, strategy of the professional development of young people, foreseen professional development and predicting of the professional activity. The latter will guarantee professionals at any moment and provide urban environment with staff reserve.

AB This article looks into new developments and additions to the concept of modernization generated by computer experiments with simulation models. The authors focused on the findings obtained within a number of modeling paradigms, including agent-oriented, system dynamics modeling, fractal geometry and self-organized criticality. The article presents a review of nonlinear effects emerging in the conditions of forced institutional modernization in the BRICS countries, for instance. The authors show that 'turbulent' modernization is typical for such countries, and is accompanied by a number of adverse factors, including cause-effect disbalance, phase transitions, sizable role of small-scale interactions, which (in some cases) may have a crucial effect on institutional dynamics. In particular, such effects have manifested themselves on the post-Soviet stage of the relations between the federal government and regional political elites in Russia. The article is also centered around issues related to preservation and expansion of traditional institutions and their influence on national modernization projects. The authors analyze the heuristic potential of different models for simulation of rapid disintegration of institutions and for the development of technologies propelling institution collapse. The present models imply the scenarios in which minor external impact may cause catastrophic consequences in a weak system of institutions ridden by archaic and dysfunctional norms and practices. The authors highlight the theoretical feasibility and practical need for non-disastrous scenarios of institutional modernization.

TI The Problem of Russian-Caucasian Historical Interaction in the National

AB Modern historical science is characterized by the presence of conceptual and methodological pluralism in the study of Russian-Caucasian historical interaction. The categorial apparatus of research on this problem includes such terms as "citizenship", "conquest", "voluntary adherence", "military-political union", etc. In different studies the same concept is filled with different semantic content, which creates a discursive field that requires in-depth scientific research.
   The article analyzes the studies of the liberal direction of pre-revolutionary historiography devoted to the problem of mutual relations between Russia and the peoples of the North Caucasus in the XVI-XIX centuries. As a tool for historiographic analysis, the work uses the disciplinary matrix of the historical science of J. Ruzen. This theoretical construction allowed to classify and conceptualize prerevolutionary research, to formulate criteria for distinguishing a liberal direction in the study of Russian-Caucasian historical interaction. The authors of the article refer to the studies of the liberal direction of prerevolutionary historical thought by the works of L. Shteder, P.S. Pallas, P.G. Butkov, S.M. Bronevskii, I.F. Blaramberg, D.I. Romanovskii, N.F. Grabovskii, A. L. Zisserman, M.Ya. Ol'shevskii and others. Their cognitive interest consisted in the desire to study and understand the nature of the mountain people, their consciousness and worldview.
   Russian liberal thought differed from the European primarily by a pronounced conservative principle and a tendency to rely on the principle of monarchism. Representatives of this direction supported the authorities' desire to join the North Caucasus, but at the same time they justified the need for a softer and more flexible policy in the region based on the values of humanism and sought to find peaceful means of "conquest" North Caucasian peoples that would avoid violent actions.

ID NEUROAESTHETICS
AB The article try to comprehend the latest achievements in such a field of neuroscience as a neuroaesthetic that explores the nature of music and musical creativity through the prism of ontogenetic features of the human brain. Numerous examples show that the key ideas of neuro-aesthetics generally correspond to the spirit of Kantian apriorism, reinterpreted in modern terms of cognitive neuroscience. The research suggests the unity of the growth points of the cognitive mechanisms of scientific knowledge and the artistry, and vistas of the research movement in this direction. Cognitive studies make it possible to establish a direct relationship between musical practice and neurophysiological processes (in particular, with functional asymmetry of the cerebral hemispheres), and the formation of neuroscience of aesthetic experience, neuro-aesthetics. This field of knowledge has the goal to answer questions related to the neurophysiological mechanism of emotional influence of music, what structures in the brain are activated when listening, performing and composing music, are responsible for determining the sound, rhythm and tonality, as well as whether the perception of music at the neurophysiological level varies between men and women. In the first part of the study "Natural Languages and the Musical-Speech Continuum: the Community of Neurobiological Foundations", ontogenetic and neurobiological bases of musicality are revealed. The article deals with the idea of the commonness of neurobiological bases of natural languages and the musical-speech continuum, which confirmed by the data of neuroscience studies on the colocalization of brain regions responsible for linguistic and musical functions. Since music is traditionally directly associated with motor activity, dance, - the idea of the role of mirror neurons of the brain in the perception of the rhythm set by musical sounds in the modalities of consonance and dissonance expressed. In the second part of the work "Cultural-ethnic musical module as an ontogenetic basis of musicality" the concept of a musical module correlating with the cognitive neurostructure is suggested, in the formation of which certain cultural and ethnic features of the environment where it is formed and continues to be generated are involved. On the basis of data from studies of Western European and Eastern artistic practice, an unambiguous dependence of their genesis and evolution on mental and neurobiological factors, which distinguish representatives of different cultures, for example, biological modes in the form of internal pulse and respiration, physical and astronomical measurements of certain cultural and historical modes, is affirmed. An assumption is made about the nature of the difference between the Western (homophonic-harmonic, and later polyphonic) and Eastern (monodic) musical traditions. It assumed that reason for this difference explained by the predominance in the West of analytical, and in the East, holistic thinking, which generated by the corresponding differences of certain areas of the brain activity. Therefore, in the first case an unconditional preference is given to the individuality, and, consequently, to the harmonious orderliness of the polyphonic texture of the "points of view".
   In the second, belonging to a certain community united by cooperative activity, which gives this community integrity, important for its self-preservation and self-identification, gave rise to the monodic constancy of recitation in combination with the immanent improvisation of intonations, the synchronization of sound impulses acquiring a collective meaning. The musical sound in the eastern musical tradition is an important factor of socialization and interaction between people. In the West, with its emphasis on individual personality traits, a different musical format adopted. The article touch the problem of the origin of music as an effective means of adapting a person to the environment. Analysis of the factors that made music an important part of human and social life allowed us to consider music as an important determinant of socialization and interaction between people. A number of researchers of the causes of the phenomenon of music pay attention to the almost unique quality of human society - the quality of synchronization of sound actions when the sound acquires a collective meaning and allows pursuing a collective goal.

AB Blogging can be considered as a type of activity, an instrument or a social and communicative technology. In the first case it can be defined as a set of the subject's activities within the frame of his electronic diary (blog) guiding, made with this or that frequency and undertaken for the expression of proper judgment, concerning these or those themes, events and subjects, also the attraction of other blogosphere participants' attention to the judgment. As an instrument, blogging allows the subject to solve tasks of communicative presence at blogosphere space. In its turn, blogging as a technology can be defined as a system of activities directed to the subject's information presence achievement at the blogosphere space, his image positioning and also his communication interaction with audience and expressed in the form of the electronic diary (blog) guiding, purposefully and systematically effected by the subject. As a social and communicative technology, blogging possesses a number of universal characteristics. Among its advantages it is possible to select: accessibility; rapidity of information transfer, creation of information occasions; ample opportunities on detail segmentation of audience; efficiency as feedback mechanism. It is necessary to note the low potential of direct information promotion and also limited influence on audience preference changes because of high blogosphere segmentation as shortcomings. One of the political blogs key features defining their popularity is a minimization of external control over the author's content. At the same time, bloggers' activities are most often directed against the dominating media and political leaders. Moreover, the increase of this technology importance in the political process makes representatives of the ruling political elite apply it more actively in their race for power. On the one hand, blogging promotes the extension of the number of political communication active participants, and, on the other hand, the number of significant leaders of a public opinion on the Network is restricted, the political discourse here differs in a high level of bias.

AB In the new information-technological way, the communicative process through electronic means of communication is an optical, almost instantaneous, way of producing a multitude of meanings simultaneously, in contrast to oral and written communication, which is characterized by diffuse propagation (slow, chaotic process of disseminating meanings). The communication process acquires such characteristic features as nonlinearity, emergence, multivariance, spontaneity, viral-ness and has hard-to-predict consequences. The use of new information technologies has also affected the political sphere of society, where information becomes a strategic resource of power. The production and specific weight of the symbolic capital of political power is directly dependent on the acceptance and perception of collective-binding political decisions by the mass audience. Political communication becomes anomalous, due to the mismatch in the communicative process.
   The characteristic features of the anomaly of political communication are manifested as following:
   1. Information impact and interaction ceases to be a controlled process;
   2. The media become "factories of uncertainty";
   3. The ambivalent consequences of the produced meanings in political communication lead to the decoherence of the communication itself and to the growth of public distrust of the authorities and the media;
   4. The communicative process becomes non-linear, multivariate, spontaneous, viral and prone to accidents;
   5. The world political process functions in a single information space in which new vectors of policy perception are set and narrow local boundaries of the individual "personal-habitable-zone" are torn;
   6. The continuous process of aberrating information becomes a characteristic feature of political communication, in which each of the actors has the opportunity to change the meaning of information;
   Information anomie as a complex of socio-techno-cultural phenomena of information aberrations, leads to the destruction of the normality of the process of political communication, resulting in a mismatch of "collective binding", which leads to entropy of the social system. The following markers of information anomie in political communication can be highlighted:
   The credit limit of trust. Reduction of the credit of public confidence leads to a decrease in the level of accumulation of the symbolic capital of the government and the media. Distortion in the balance of confidence, through decrease in its degree. It leads to the destruction of "collective binding". The effects of information anomie in the political sphere reflect the growing process of aberration of the meaning of information by all participants in political communication:
   Scalability;
   Virulence;
   Retrospective;
   Growth-Hacking;
   Danger.
   It is concluded that minimizing the destructive information impact, which creates threats, dangers and risks to the sustainable development of the society becomes the most important task of all participants in political communication.

AB The paper discusses the evolution of the peasant family in Russia in the twentieth century. We have studied the structure and dynamics of the Ural peasant family in the 1920s-1960s. In our comparative analysis we used the materials of the 1929 and 1936 budget studies of peasant households in the Urals. These data were supplemented by other sources: the Party Census of 1922, the population censuses of 1926 and 1939, and Soviet films of the period between the 1920s and 1970s. The analysis of budget statistics has brought to light the following characteristics of the demographic transition: the family structure was changing at an accelerated pace (from 1920 to the 1960s); the family transformation was affected by demographic disasters such as wars and political campaigns (collectivization, forced evictions of the population of small rural settlements). The intensive rural migration of the 1950s and 1960s turned into a major demographic disaster, too. As a result, the peasant family became unable to provide the agricultural economy with adequate population reproduction.

DE qualia; phisicalism; reduction; the knowledge argument; Mary's room
AB The article is dedicated to one of the most complicated questions of philosophy of mind - reducibility of phenomenal properties or qualia to properties of other types. There are a lot of arguments used by proponents of irreducible qualia to prove their position. Likely, the knowledge argument, better known as "Mary's room" thought experiment, is the most discussed of them. It's a story about girl who has been imprisoned in black and white room since her birth, where she, impulsed by her curving to unknown, has studied every single physical fact about color, and then she was released to see the colored world with her own eyes. Intuition tells that Mary, who has leaved the room, will study something new about colors, for example, what it is like to see red. It's usually considered that accepting the intuition testifies against physicalism about qualia. John Perry, the author of "Knowledge, Possibility and Consciousness" (2001), disagrees with this position. Basing on analysis of examples from semantics of propositional attitudes, Perry formulates his own concept of content, assuming that any knowledge contains a reflexive component that bounds the subject matter component of this knowledge to some subjective perspective - a perspective, from which this knowledge was received or from which it can be used in practice. As he shows further, the novelty of Mary's knowledge of colors is in that reflexive component. So, assuming existence of some special non-physical properties is not necessary to accept intuitive result of thought experiment with Mary, it is sufficient to distinguish subjective perspectives.

Geach's article launch a wholesale attack on these theories advanced by "some Oxford philosophers" whom he accuses of ignoring "the distinction between calling a thing 'P' and predicating 'P' of the thing". In it, Geach provides a fairly detailed description of Frege's arguments in relation to prescriptivism (replacing it with the term "ascriptivism"), set forth, in his opinion, in an article by Herbert Hart, "The Ascription of Responsibility and Rights". Geach specifically targets Hart's claim that sentences of the form "He did it" are not primarily descriptive but ascriptive of responsibility for actions. The translation into Russian P. Geach "Ascriptivism" is presented in appendix.

DE territorial isolation; transport accessibility; subsistence economy;
   rural community sustainability; local self-government
AB In the 1990s, the public transportation system in provincial Russia shrank significantly. Most affected were the water transport and small aircraft aviation. As a result, many rural local communities, not connected with the "mainland" by all-season roads, found themselves in territorial isolation. The paper deals with the case of villages that have poor transport communication with the outer world, including their district (rayon) center, or none at all (in the conventional sense). It studies the influence of territorial isolation on their sustainability. One can find two opposing views of such influence in the academic literature. According to the first approach, after losing government support, peripheral and especially hard-to-reach villages become economically unviable, unattractive for living in them and doomed to extinction. According to the second approach, the noninterference of the state in the life of the local population enhances the solidarity, self-organization and self-sufficiency of the communities, which makes them sustainable to economic cataclysms. Based on the findings of his field research, which addressed the social structure of territorially isolated settlements, the author attempts to contribute to the development of these approaches. He concludes that under otherwise equal starting conditions at the time when transport accessibility collapsed or deteriorated, those communities that became considerably isolated turn out to be sustainable (viable), and sometimes even more so than their non-isolated counterparts, whereas the resilience of communities that ended up in minor isolation sharply decreases. In other words, with the emergence and increase of territorial isolation, the sustainability curve of communities first declines, and then starts to rise. This is due to the following circumstances. Insignificant isolation manifests primarily its disadvantages - poor transport accessibility and supply, unavailability of any decent labor market, low profitability of business, etc. However, the more isolated a community is, the more such shortcomings are balanced and sometimes even outweighed by the increasing advantages, the principal one being the ability of the locals to use the surrounding natural resources at their discretion and free of any control.

That is not the case with Jerusalem regarded by Israelis as a "united and indivisible capital of the Jewish State".

The later vision enjoys total support in terms of international law expressed in a number of the UN resolutions. For decades-long span, the Jerusalem issue has been a point of divergence between the American Congress (under the constant pressure of the Pro-Israeli lobby) and the White House (executive administrations) responsible for the U.S. Foreign policy management. The issue of the American embassy's move from Tel-Aviv to Jerusalem emerged as a key one for Israel's supporters in Congress since the year 1950. The law adopted in 1995 was to oblige the U.S. government to finally move the embassy to the West Jerusalem largely acknowledged as Israel's capital. But the subsequent American governments preferred to postpone the implementation of this law first and foremost out of fear to see the Arab anger implying the U.S. to lose its unique mediator positions in the region. Even the most devoted Israel's advocates among the American presidents have preferred to refrain from this politically risky step. Barack Obama's approach to the pivotal issues between Israel and Palestine has even enraged the Israeli politicum, which facilitated the Pro-Israeli lobby support for Trump on his way to the White House. Nevertheless, even Trump did not dare to implement his electoral promise in respect of the embassy move. But the chances to see his promise come true are greater than ever before.

AB The difference between the First and Second Godel's theorem is discussed in perspective of possible rehabilitation of the Hilbert Program. The essence of the difference lies in the fact that if the First theorem is extensional, then the Second theorem is intensional. The formalization of the consistency concept used in the proof of the Second Theorem is reconsidered, particularly, the other ways of expressing the consistency property that are not subject to this theorem. In this paper, we investigate what can be considered a formal expression of a meaningful concept of consistency. The formalization of the consistency concept, used in the proof of the Second Theorem, is contested with the presentation of other ways of expressing the consistency property, for which the second theorem does not hold. It is investigated what can be considered a formal expression of the concept of consistency.

DE pragmatism; neopragmatism; R. Bernstein; R. Rorty; J. Habermas;
   pragmatic turn; communicative rationality
AB Significant place in R. Bernstein's late works has the concept of "pragmatic turn", linked with communicative rationality. In the article we analyze the origin of this term showing that the origin of this notion can be traced formally from one private discussion between R. Rorty and J. Habermas, which concerned of understanding some points of Kantian philosophy, but Bernstein was able to actualize this concept. Rorty and Habermas themselves have serious discrepancies in their understanding of communicative rationality and its ultimate goals, but they both agree on an understanding of the concept of "pragmatc turn". Rorty eventually tends to the term "rhetorical turn", while his followers and critics use the Habermas' term "pragmatic turn" in the meaning of "radicalization of the linguistic turn". Bernstein's reduction of various directions to pragmatism is realized in the appropriationist methodology: he extends the context of one' belonging to the philosophical tradition to the context of contemporary philosophical or even social problems, otherwise it couldn't be distinguish eternal philosophical problems from particular immediate issues, and his conclusions are of an clarification, but not of dogmatic explanation for those processes that occur in the philosophy of the XXth century. Throughout his work, Bernstein several times clarifies the pragmatic themes, and finally offers the following list: (1) anti-foundationalism; (2) community of inquirers; (3) fallibilism; (4) radical contingency; (5) pluralism. The listed topics firstly coincide with the characteristics of relativism, and secondly, they intersect with the characteristics of the rhetorical turn, which gives good reasons for talking about the interdependence of rhetorical turn, pragmatism and relativistic methodology. Three themes from the new list - the community of inquirers, fallibilism and radical contingency - are contained, as a basic element, the relativistic and pragmatic motif (raised by Peirce) of the absence a chasm between the subject and the object, or mind and world due to tertia or "thirdness". So we give a brief excursion into the pragmatic problem of tertia and the discussions around it. Bernstein seeks to discover those sides in continental and analytic philosophies that bring them closer to pragmatism by establishing a common list of "pragmatic themes" common to any philosophy, behind which the recognition of communicative rationality shines. According to Bernstein, pragmatism should act as an interactive tool, because the whole of this tradition exists as a "dialogue" or "argument".

DT Article
DE United States; "Tramponomics"; national interest; external economic
   relations; trade policy; trade liberalization agreements; protective
   measures; protectionism; trade wars
AB The article analyses the key points of the emerging economic strategy of the D. Trump administration. The authors believe that the most provocative U. S. initiatives for reforming the American foreign economic relations (radicalization of the trade policy, "rebalancing" foreign trade in favor of the United States, and especially isolationism as opposed to globalization) may harm the international trading system. In his own country, Trump's reforms are meeting unprecedented political opposition, led by both democrats and neo-conservatives. So, Trump' abilities to transform the American economy now are less evident than those of R. Reagan or even B. Obama. In any case, the process of reforming international economic system, initiated by President Trump will most likely continue after expiration of the term of his administration. Some of his ideas meet cool reception even among the closest U.S. trade partners. The emerging new economic actors (China, India, Brazil and others) generally support the idea of modernization of the world trade rules and regulations, but their expectations not necessary correlate with those of Mr. Trump. Fortunately, many Trump` s practical actions, in contrast to some of his pre- and post-election public statements, contain few immediate threats that might trigger an open trade war. There is a chance that we shall see a sort of more close U.S.-China partnership in the near future, though it does not exclude the possibility of aggravated conflicts in some areas (cyber-security, intellectual property, technology transfer and so on). The relations with Russia are not in the forefront of Trump's economic policy. Nevertheless, we believe that the success of Trump's reforms will make the USA more interested in increasing exports to Russia and may even open possibilities for closer economic cooperation. Some of his administration's radical initiatives, such as orientation on national priorities, protection of domestic manufacturers, and preference in some cases of bilateral cooperation instead of multilateral may prove to be worth a special study. Trump's critics of the international economic organizations and even COP2 also have certain objective reasons. Russia may only gain from transition to priority of domestic market and some additional protectionism, which at the same time should not be harmful for its imports of innovative machinery and technologies.

DT Article
DE Taxation; tax system; transformation; Qin; Han; early Chinese empires;

AB The article analyses the formation of the fiscal system in the early Chinese empires of Qin and Han against the background of political and economic history of fourth to first centuries B. C. The Qin fiscal model took shape in the middle of the Warring States period (453-221 B. C.) and featured a number of in-kind taxes and labour levies to maximize resource extraction from a relatively circumscribed fiscal base. This system proved itself as an efficient mechanism through which the Qin campaigns of conquest were financed during the fourth and third centuries B. C., but its functioning was associated with high monitoring costs and ruled out fiscal compromise with local elites. In course of the century that followed the collapse of the Qin Empire in 207 B. C., the second fiscal transformation took place, which resulted in the development of fiscal principles and techniques that endured for the next two millennia of China's imperial history.

DT Article
DE Yenisei province; public sentiment; World War I; food crisis; families

AB The article looks into the evolution of public sentiment in the Yenisei province during the First World War. The research undertaken helps understand why the population's discontent grew rapidly in rural provinces that were far away both from the frontline and from the country's political centers and were supposed to provide all possible resources for victory. The authors show that that was largely due to the deteriorating socio-economic and living conditions. Peasants believed that the mobilisation carried out by the state depriving their households of manpower was to be compensated for through loans, reduced taxes, and the allowed use of prisoners of war as working force. The non-introduction of these measures led to disappointment with political authorities and fuelled the sense of social injustice among the population. The lack of manufactured goods and the high cost of food in cities only added to the growing irritation and resentment. The influx of refugees and prisoners of war, in turn, exacerbated the local people's socio-economic problems. The decline in living standards affected, first and foremost, the poorest groups, including families of the mobilised. In the course of the war, the number of such people increased whereas public and charitable support was reduced. This resulted in unorganised and spontaneous acts of violence as a sign of protest on the part of soldiers' families.

DE Foucault; Mamardashvili; necessity; structure
AB It was the Soviet philosopher Mamardashvili who has put into the question the self-evidence of the notion of the structure (episteme) by Foucault. By answering to the question what the structure is, Mamardashvili said, the structure is the possibility of the succession of other possibilities.
   To compare Foucault's and Mamardashvili's works seems to involve some risks. The major difference between them the scholars see in the question of the Enlightenment. Mamardashvili saw the role of the Enlightenment in the modernity as a progressive one, and Foucault, in opposite, as a regressive. But we can say that against all evidence the notion of the episteme by Foucault is placed on a special level of the critique. Foucault speaks not only about the crisis of the Cogito, but about new opportunities to think the philosophical classics. The same thing said Mamardashvili, interpreting the works of Descartes or Kant. It is wrong to associate the modernity with just a temporal dimension. The modernity both by Mamardashvili and Foucault includes the past. And this past is not any accumulation of errors, but as a way to think the conditions of the thought. This method we call - together with Sartre - a progressive-regressive one and we oppose it to the dialectic.
   The dialectic wants we consider the necessity as a negation of the freedom. We see that by Foucault, the necessity (apriori) has nothing to do with the freedom. The freedom is seldom a sign of the historical necessity, said he. And Mamardashvili spoke seldom about the freedom, but the freedom is the necessity of the conscience of the historical freedom, said he. So, the freedom is a kind of historical necessity by both of them. Mamardashvili and Foucault both proved that it is necessary to think the Cartesianism not only as a phenomenon of the remote past, nor a stage of the history of sciences. To think about Descartes is to think about the necessity of the presence of the conscience (mathesis) in the world and to think the world as a structure.

The goal is to identify invariant in personality temporary storage duration.
   We believe that the reflective recollection is a set of mental operations that can be characterized as purposive sampling, refining, together with the rationalization of the elements. The results of the article can be considered as follows. Firstly, the author reveals the specifics of reflective memory, given the characteristics of its operations. Secondly, the author showed that there is an emotional introjection previous temporal states in the actual content of consciousness.

DE communication revolution; media policy; communication; Ch. de Gaulle; N.
   Sarkozy; F. Mitter-rand; F. Holland; political media alliance
AB Communication permeates all spheres of public life, to influence politics, the formation of political meanings, images and ideas. In the modern world, politics is done with help of innovative methods of communication. The article examines how the relationship between politics and journalism in France transformed during the Fifth Republic due to change in the political regime and an increasing role of communication in the society. At the beginning of the Fifth Republic, the information policy had been formed by the power of the state; however, this power gradually abandoned a tight control over radio and television. In the new century, politics has been more closely approaching the media. In the era of media politics, politicians successfully master the latest methods of communication with the audience, while journalists focus less on the information content than on commenting and evaluation. Politicians are getting involved in the creation of a "political spectacle" together with journalists to whet the interest of the public. On the basis of interviews conducted by the author of the article, it can be traced how politicians and journalists evaluate their interaction and react to changes in their own social roles. It has been shown that the activities of politicians and journalists are getting closer; these activities obey the logic of "the current situation", they are characterized by conspicuous behaviors. The number of participants in the process of political communication has been growing; judges and investigators are getting involved. As a result of reforms, the institution of the Presidency has strengthened in France, despite the fact that at the same time, the society underwent a process of de-sacralization of the presidential power. Increasingly, presidents have become objects for journalistic and criminal investigations, while legal ways to protect the privacy of the president are absent. However, media popularity of politicians does not convert into a public trust. Opinion polls of recent years show that the majority of the French population does not trust the political elite. It is not clear if political actors will be able to overcome the limitations brought by the age of revolution in communications and to convert the capital of virtual connections into real interaction with society.

   Right is a form of social existence of man and society, which enshrined the idea that man and society need to preserve their integrity against internal and external destructive forces. Based on universally accepted norms of universal humanistic attitudes, the right is intended to regulate and to regulate the existence of civilized communities, to provide not only a social discipline, but the freedom of citizens, to defend the interests of both the state and the individual.
   Currently, the concept of "right" and "humanism" reveals in close interaction and interdependence.

The problem is that even at the level of theoretical understanding of humanistic values and ideals are getting extremely broad interpretation, therefore, the implementation of humanistic attitudes in politics is doomed to disorder and conflict. But, it is in humanism might establishment of the Foundation, which will allow to realize the principles of real democracy, good will, cooperation and dialogue, peace and tolerance. General pre-condition of this is a humanistic dialogue at the level of ideological and philosophical differences. The decisive role in this belongs to philosophical reflection, unity of centrifugal and centripetal intentions of human thought.

TI THE CONDITIONS AND CONSEQUENCES OF DIGITALIZATION OF MODERN SOCIETY:

DE digitalization; digital technologies; work attitudes; socio-economic
   changes
AB The digitalization is seen as an irreversible destiny for the humankind, and distinguished scientists expect the future to be tightly connected and saturated with digital technologies (for instance, Lyotard 1998, Bell 1999, Lyon 2013 etc.). However, not much is known about critical shifts, which have occurred in social, cultural and economic domains, and the future perspectives of digitalization seem obscure.
   The current article is aimed at describing the phenomenon of "digitalization" from socioeconomic perspective and educing the main features of the digitalized society. The article includes two parts. Firstly, the historico-philosophical theory of French professor Pier Levy is considered in detail. P. Levy (1997, 1998) has set forward the theory of four anthropological spaces, which includes the "earth", "territory", "commerce" spaces and the modern "knowledge space".
   The knowledge space we are living in is characterized by the mass usage of technological apps, the inclusion of humans in innovation networks, the rise in collective intelligence, the replacement of material relationship to the world by more epistemological one, the refusal of geographical references, and by the constant redefinitions of the human identity via adjusting to the changing and fragile environment, which is becoming more and more digitalized.
   The second part of the article is devoted to the analysis of the impact of digitalization on the economic sphere. The latest book written by the economist Prof. Klaus Schwab "The Fourth Industrial Revolution" (2017) serves as a guide to the new digital economy. Klaus Schwab highlights such characteristics of modern society, which in many respects goes in parallel with Levy's theory, as interconnectedness, knowledge access, growing capabilities to storage and receipt information, constant transformation of the economic sector, global extension of the changes, the emergence of global society, and the collective future for all the people. Besides, Prof. Schwab highlights that in case of three industrial revolutions, which preceded the Fourth one (the 1st revolution of 1760th-1840th, the 2nd revolution of the late 19th-early 20th century, and the 3rd revolution of the 1960th-1990th), the main consequence of them was the growing mechanization of the work process but not the absolute automatization of it. That means that the Forth industrial revolution creates the base for the replacement of human employees by the digital apps in the sphere of physical work and even in some areas of knowledge economy, which creates risks for the future labor market and the future economy on the whole.

DE frame; premised knowledge; the condition; the foundations
AB The problem of premised knowledge wasn't as relevant for philosophical studies 10-15 years as for modern Russian philosophy. There are many version of definition of the premise knowledge and examples of solutions of its problems in the philosophical literature. Paradigm, style of scientific thoughts, scientific views of the world, episteme are isolated by researchers. Also you can meet such form of the premise knowledge as a priori forms, ordinary notions, prejudices, etc. Forms of the premised knowledge can show you the premised knowledge in different sides. They help you to find more examples of solutions of premised knowledge problems. The problem is there are no specific, individual examples of premise knowledge in our vocabulary. Researching of theoretical constructs, which helps to solve the problem of premise knowledge, becomes the main task for the researchers. Understanding of the premise knowledge and its problem will be possible if you can understand its forms. The theory of frames is the theory that enough developed in modern philosophy. There are many researches, papers on the theory of frames in the field of philosophy, linguistics, cybernetics, sociology and others. The application of the theory of frames from different areas of knowledge which should solve the problems of premise knowledge is discussed in this article. I. Goffman was a founder of social-psychological theory of frames. Cybernetic systems were considered by M. Minsky. Linguistic theory was called by Charles Fillmore. The most generalized theory of frame was presented by V.S. Vakhshtayn. The theory of frames becomes a "good" example of the explanation of the essence of premise knowledge, but it would be a mistake to identify the premised knowledge with the theory of frame. The system of frames and the premised knowledge are an independent system with own structure, own definitions, concepts and characteristics. The frame should be allocated as a form of premise knowledge. Understanding of the frame helps us to understand the nature of this knowledge.

The critical arguments of Peter Hacker against the dominant in analytical legal philosophy approach to the definition of the legal concepts of Herbert Hart are presented and analyzed. It os shown that both Bentham's position and Hart's arguments against the definition of per genus et differentiam are invalid, since there is no reason to think that paraphrastic definition or truth-conditional definition are uniquely suited to the definition of fundamental legal or normative concepts. The translation into Russian P. Hacker's "Definition in Jurisprudence" is presented in appendix.

DE Russian revolution of 1917; V.I. Lenin; modernisation; state regulation;
   V.V. Putin; Russian industrial project
AB The paper dwells on the Russian Revolution of 1917 as part of a global modernisation process. Russia has gone through the same stages of an industrial society formation as other developed countries of the world. The specificity of its transition from the agrarian to the industrial stage of development is the seizure of political power at the stage of industrial revolution not by the bourgeoisie, as in other countries of the world, but by the working class led by the Bolshevik political party - RSDLP(b). Its leader V.I. Lenin proposed suggested that the universal Anglo-Saxon model of industrialism and private capital should be substituted for a state-capitalist model based on state and cooperative property and state regulation of the economy (NEP). This project was not implemented in the USSR due to the pressure of internal and external factors and was substituted by a mobilisation administrative-command management model, which corresponded to the totalitarian political regime. A.N. Kosygin (the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR) attempted to launch a transition to market management methods in the 1960s, but this attempt was curtailed by party dogmatists. M.S. Gorbachev continued the reforms in the 1980s (Perestroika), but due to lack of competence his belated measures led to the loss of power by the Communists and liberal reforms that were also incompetent and dishonest. With V.V. Putin's presidency, Russia has partly returned to the state regulation of the economy.

Even though Lenin appeared to hold a very negative view of this Russian Louis Blanc (in reference to the 1848 revolution in France), the Bolsheviks did not dare to criticise him publicly; Kerensky was seen as "untouchable" at least until the first signs of disaffection from the soldiers appeared. Comparing contemporary writings by Kerensky and Lenin with those that they penned a posteriori, this article challenges many of the received ideas regarding political culture in revokitionary Russia.

DE Construction; nationalism; political technologies; ethnic identity
AB The tendency to globalisation of world space is observed in the modern world. In this regard, the ethnic factor in political processes and the management of Compound States are significantly updated. The going deep politicisation of ethnicity is accompanied by new manifestations in different processes that dictate the need of a search for theoretical and methodological means of research. Ethnicity represents a social construct whose intrinsic basis is self-attribution of the individual to the social community existing in subjective perception ('We') and the symbolic marking of cultural distinctions from other communities. Their formation/gain is influenced by ideas about objectivity and vernacularity of the existence of 'we-groups' and the significance of inte-rgroup distinctions. Ethnic identity can be defined as a social construct that is a product of the subjective relation/perception of individuals of intergroup entities and contradictions filled by ethnic sense. In the modern world the permission of some questions is of great importance not only in the scientific, but also in the ideological and political sphere. These are questions such as forms whose distribution and information processing society can accept; why information takes the central place in modern social systems and how it influences social, economic and social relationships.

DE sub-state / sub-national actors; international / external relations of
   regions; regionalization; globalization
AB International relations are in a stage of deep transformation today. Among other things, the composition of actors in international relations and world politics is changing. The role of non-traditional players is becoming increasingly important. The number of nontraditional actors include non-governmental and non-profit organizations, transnational corporations, social and national liberation movements, etc. Among them stand out sub-state / subnational actors in international relations. This includes internal regions of the states. The article examines the theoretical aspects of sub-state actors in international relations. The author believes that today the state's regions are the most specific international actors. This is due to the fact that they differ significantly from traditional and other non-traditional players in the international relations. To justify this thesis, the article considers the problems of globalization and regionalization, the formation of new levels of international relations, the analysis of foreign practices of subnational international relations, peculiarities of sub-state actors; analyzes the issues of sovereignty and legal personality and the national regulatory framework. Examples of Russian and foreign practices are given as examples. The information basis of the article includes the works of leading Russian specialists in the sphere of international activities of subnational actors and research data on related issues. The analytical and synthetic processing of the received information allows to develop the subject of the study. The theoretical and methodological basis of research is multi-disciplinary in nature and relies on methods used in historical and political sciences. The article uses a historical-genetic method and logical-intuitive modeling. As a result, the author comes to a conclusion that the high degree of specificity of sub-state actors is due to their " state" origin, to the use of specific tools and to the political-legal status both at the level of national and international legislation. In the academic sense, the further study of the topic will accelerate the formation of an independent segment of the international relations theory on international activities of sub-state actors. The study of the specifics of subnational actors in international relations has great potential and in practical terms can play an important role in changing the current negative situation in some states where there are problems of implementation of the international potential of their regions. This fully applies to Russia.

In the main part of the article the author, firstly, highlights the main features of the process of creative thinking. Secondly, determine the structure of knowledge of creative thinking. Thirdly, defines the methodological principles of research of creative thinking taking into account activity approach.
   The thinking represents implementation of logical transactions. However complexity in studying of nominal creative thinking is that, along with studying of processes of systematization and a statement already known - the combination of ready elements, actual becomes research of processes of detection something "new", forming of knowledge. Creative thinking is not always consistent structure of thought, which makes it difficult to study the issue. Any action in the process of thinking and are subject to a multi-directional non-uniformity.
   The transition from one task to another is not necessarily sequentially. The division into parts of the thinking process so that the resulting sum of these parts could be combined into a single unit, mandatory, but not the only requirement for the process. The difficulty lies in establishing links between these parts. As the most important characteristics of the process, the author defines the structure of a certain thinking processes. One of the requirements is the formation of a certain result of intellectual activity expressed in the product form. In the case of creative thinking - a significant new product, presented in the form of knowledge. In modern understanding it is the answer to the problem question. Describing the structure of knowledge about creativity, the author notes, the main problem is that the part existing in the scientific world of concepts different object, that is, they do not reflect the same attribute property of subjects of the objective world. Methodological principles of the study of creative thinking given the activity approach due to the specific knowledge.
   On the one hand, the acquisition of new knowledge on the basis of previously known ideas. On the other, the development of new knowledge from knowledge already available. At the end of the article the author summarizes and concludes.

AB Seizure of the concept of "historical reality" from the circulation, denial of the image of the time of history as centralized one-way process, the loss of "social" in the postmodern tradition by them has led to the transformation of the future to the periphery of historical consciousness. The future loses its ontological essence, independence, and, in the best case, is considered as part of the present or the semblance of the past. The arguments in favor of the revision of ideas about the future were as follows: first, a protest against the utopism that has spread in the XX century, claims to truth and is a breeding ground for the ideology and totalitarianism. Secondly, the statement that the future can only repeat the past, while the past appears only as a set of fragments. Thirdly, the inability of the modernists to foresee random and unexpected events. Fourth, the specific of social and human sciences, including history, consists in the fact that knowledge of the future change reality itself. Fifth, the insolvency of designing: projects claim the rigid predetermination of the future and motion to it. But this rigidity leads to the moral obsolescence of the project, it throws him back and he begins to be behind time. The researchers, despite the criticism of modernist ideas about the future, do not leave attempts of its "detect", put forward various hypotheses, are searching for methods of its cognition. The Future of time of history in the framework of postmodern conception of history appears: 1. As forecast, primarily short-term, as long-term forecasting should include retrospective information, which is not recognized as valid. It involves large amount of information from sources unrelated (rhizomatous). Modern foreign and domestic researchers have questioned not only in long-term forecasting, and the ability to design in history. With the help of the project, as opposed to the forecast and prediction, attempts are being made deliberate change the reality, and even her modeling. But the project can't take into account the diversity of events, it is fixed and morally outdated even before realization and is often behind the times. 2. As a part of the present, the similarity of the past, as "know" about it can only be based on a current situation or the fragments of the past. 3. As desired future, referring only to the requirements and problems of contemporary society. Such image of the future deprives of reality, because it is a convenient substitute for a real future. 4. As "other" unknowable future, manifested only when "falls down" on us, takes hold of us. 5. As the final, which "highlights", imparts meaning, clarifies the meaning of the events or facilities of present. In this case, it is possible only know what exists in the present way or another be completed and find conditions of it again in the same present. 6. As a set of prospects of manipulation of the various possibilities that may arise in the future. Thus, the future of the historical time from meaningful, predictable in general terms is transformed into a set of features of its detection, some trends.

DE existentialism; silence; language; dialogue; creativity
AB The author locates the phenomenon of silence in the context of existential philosophy. The author interprets silence in existentialism using the theories by M. Heidegger, M. Buber, J.-P. Sartre. The article dwells upon ethic, social and mainly aesthetic reasons for the necessity of a special inner interpersonal dialogue in existentialism, with silence being the indication of such a dialogue. M. Heidegger describes silence as an important existential phenomenon. There is a chain of senses around us that are clear and inherently explained. Thinking about understanding we, in fact, are in the state of distraction. We are out of practice in hearing the speech as a sound, interpreting it as music behind the stream of senses. Speech melodiousness is our lost skill of discovering the world as new and secret. The given musical skill should be reactivated. According to M. Heidegger, the first step is to hear "pure noise". The second step is to find silence when we get a deeper understanding of existence - we do not merely hear the silence of the world, but interpret it as some dialogical opponent. The role of silence in the existential dialogue is described by M. Buber. The author differentiates between two types of relations: I - You and I - It. The existential dialogue arises in I - You type. In Buber's opinion, the best way in keeping the intimacy of I - You meeting is silence. J.-P. Sartre dwells upon silence in terms of prosaic creativity. J.-P. Sartre points out the prosist's "unaware silence". The philosopher puts forward the following dialectics: the form must become silent in order to get the full sense and to reveal the author's view. In this connection it is important for Sartre to understand the word not as the representation of sense but as the author's mouthpiece. When a writer screams using words he becomes silent. The highest note of the scream is silence. It is wrong to interpret silence as dialogue avoidance and reluctance to have it. On the contrary, silence will be the marker of irreducibility, purity of existential intercourse. In such a silent intercourse there is no possibility for a dialogue opponent to be idealized because we apparently realize his weak points as well as ours. The point of unification is excluded because we are well aware of the fact that we are different and that is why we tend to get in touch with our opponent as someone who is different from us. There is no sign of insincerity and flattery in the silent dialogue, no collective professional solidarity and any other external form of communication.

DE myth; mythological consciousness; childhood; boyhood; identity
AB Myth is a form of experience of understanding representing the world as a unity. And the unity becomes as a comprehend existence. Mythologemes (symbols) and mythologies are presented here as cultural imperatives and life scenarios. The myth refers to construction of personal and collective identity. These cultural imperatives and life scenarios are modeling our past, present and, the foremost, our future by moderating its critical uncertainty. The identity is a self-relation, the unity of understanding of an inner man. A man as part of it feels and acts as a unity in the inconstant world. We have a crisis of personal and collective identity today. This identity is performative. Life forms are determined by mythological basis, tradition or something from folklore and post-folklore. (In one hand the folklore tradition refers to things being under taboos. In other hand it could be unreflect in unconscious collective.) These life forms needs to be named because of great importance in social matter. A mythological matrix creates a combination of behavior stereotypes and variety of social roles. The boyhood is a subject that refers to demographic aspects of boy image forming (as baby, child, teenager and youth). All the images comprehends a mythological aspect. Firstly, the subject of boyhood is connected with mythology of childhood and myth as a 'childhood of consious'. Secondly, its connected with the mythology of gender and thus with growing masculinity and rites of crossing social borders. And thirdly the subject of boyhood is connected with myths of mass conscious, mass culture and patterns of unconscious collective.

DE argumentation; pragmatics; hyper-language; text
AB Contemporary argumentative texts variety by the one hand, and multiplicity of recommendations for their creation by the other, tell about daily necessity of forming the integrative approach, which would allow operating with argumentative texts of different types. The article is dedicated to researching the argumentative practices in their variety. The subject of investigation is methodological basis of argumentation analysis which allows to compare argumentative texts of different types. There are two attempts in the modern argumentation theory to formulate a generalizing approach to argumentative practices research: the analytical historical-philosophic approach (Barnes J., Cross R., Dancy R.M. and others) and the historical approach by Maurice A. Finocchiaro. The first one is to study argumentation in philosophical texts and is aimed at the clarifying the sense of philosophical text; it supposes using formalization as a method for correlating the texts of different types. The second one is a three-step method: 1) "suitable" text choice; 2) immersion into context; 3) formulating generalizations regarding the text argumentative specificity. The both approaches are focused on argumentative practices diachronic research, and both have serious disadvantages. So, in the analytical historical-philosophic approach we could get an overly cumbersome formal language as a result of text of different types formalization, its usage would not be effective. Finocchiaro's approach supposes too strict criteria of the text selection, as a result of which a huge array of argumentative practices remains "out of the study". However in later works Finocchiaro introduces the term "meta-argumentation", which has a serious heuristic potential. Developing further his ideas we will understand argumentation as a specific hyperlanguage, which is a sign system, and its basic elements are macrostructures of a natural language. We can formulate syntax, semantics and pragmatics for the argumentative hyperlanguage. This approach we will name "pragma-analytic". It supposes an explicit emphasis on the pragmatic side of argumentation and at the same time preserves the proximity of the language understanding in analytical tradition.

DE moral; ethics; practice; moral action; friendly action; forgiveness;
   justice; loyalty
AB In the experience of the moral action we can find such obviousness, which could give us a way to find the ethics. Moral actions are the conscious or reasonable actions caused by moral considerations or by idea of the moral due. Examples of moral actions are the friendly action, the forgiveness, the loyalty and the justice. Description of friendly act contains important difficulty: a friendly act can't take place or for the sake of some external purposes or in order to seem friendly. And the is not so much that it is not defined in any state of things (rational or social definition), but the fact that it generally difficult to describe as a reasonable, sequential action: the presence of intention makes a friendly act as such makes it impossible. Therefore, to understand as possible friendly act as a conscious or sequential action, we have to assume such motives, or a position that would not be reduced to the status quo, or to an value morality as such. Similarly, can be described the experience of forgiveness. As well as a friendly act, forgiveness contains rational contradiction: "forgiveness can only be unforgivable". Indeed, if in the act of forgiveness we dealt with what should (or allowed) to forgive, it would have abolished the very need of forgiveness as some special act, special actions. Forgiveness (as well as a friendly act) is inexplicable in terms of "reality" - the real situation and the actual social relations. It is explicable only if it involves an uncertain future, or if it admits that future surpasses any opportunities to present themselves or to present the relationship with the abuser. Thus, the analysis of the experience of acts done for moral reasons, shows us that the ethical experience is essentially an experience of openness to the future or to the possibility of being. Description of the real ethical experience it requires the identification of rational contradictions: moral actions violate current order relations, they have no reason in the order of things, but also have no reason in the independent value of morality as such. We recognize as moral such act as gives an opportunity to make the future or being realized.

AB Brexit expresses substantial changes and transformations of the British statehood and in the UK's relations with its partners in the EU and beyond. The British, who historically have been Eurosceptic, voted to leave the EU. By having done that, the authors asserts, they have started a disintegration process in their own state and in the EU. The aim of the article is to explore reasons, results and the prospects of Brexit. The authors analyze the European integration process's aspects, the European financial and migration crisis, opinions of the EU citizens, political and party debates on integration process in the UK, the British approach to referendums, and comparison of the two referendums on integration in the UK. The results of the referendum split in two the main British parties and the British society. The implications of Brexit are complex. There is an intrigue: how to keep the British participation in the Single Market and how to prevent disintegration of the state in the face of the Scottish National Party's demands. In the conclusion the authors underline British pragmatism and define the UK aspirations for Global Britain as a desire not to be confined to the European arena only.

The feministic sociology is a relatively new area of science both in the West, and in Russia. Now the subject domain of researches develops actively, discussed and criticized. It is considered to be that in sociology the first works dedicated to the study of "women's issue" belong to the western scientists. However the problem of a provision of women aroused great interest among representatives of the most different directions of sociological science in Russia. One of the most pressing issues and at the same time the least studied is consideration of the prospect for the birth of feministic ideas within the geographical direction of Russian sociology. The famous Russian scientific, historian, the publicist, the philosopher, the ethnographer, the sociologist of the positivistic direction Afanasy Prokopyevich Shchapov devoted to this problem a number of works. Based on the analysis of the works of scientist it is possible to speak about setting the author wide range of the problems infringing on interests of both sexes equally. Shchapov A. P. pays attention to the special role of woman in the development of society, to specifics of the happening historical and social processes through which the evolved status of woman and the attitude towards her, to history of the formation of women's subordination in Russia. In the works of Russian sociologist is attached to a context and historical dynamics of samples and prescriptions of maskulinity and femininity of particular importance.

DE agriculture; farmers; food security; wheat; reform; Russia
AB Food security, a concept legitimated since the 1990s by the aid programs of international organizations, such as the FAO, World Bank and OECD, is now subject to a strong trend toward "renationalization", which varies depending on the international context and domestic concerns. Fieldwork has shed light on three registers of discourse for referring to food security in Russia since the end of the USSR. The original one was voiced during food shortages or at times of risks of famine and malnutrition in the Russia of the 1990s. Validated by the president's office, it argued for keeping the doors of trade open as wide as possible to food imports and opposed attempts to subsidize a national agriculture. The second, heard during the first decade of the new century in the context of membership in the WTO, switched perspectives by promoting farming and a negotiated integration into international trade. The third has prevailed in the context of the financial melt-down and the downturn in trade with Western countries. This discourse on developing a national agriculture advocates closing the doors to international trade. These registers of discourse have had quite real effects on productive structures and, during each period, realigned political forces in the country and the social consensus.

   During the study it turned out that the relation between the personal characteristics result in two main factorial axes: first is the "self-identity" axis with the poles of authenticity (compliance of the person's life with his/her desires, needs and ideas) related to the life satisfaction and motivation for the goal-achievement, and alienation, characterized by low life satisfaction and very low purposefulness. The second is the "self-discipline" axis with the poles of disorganization (with which the flexibility and spontaneity are related) and organization (correlated with regulation and rigidness).
   Second, relation between the personal characteristics and individual estimations of the potential realization of the fundamental life is complex: the "authenticity" qualities always correlated with the positive estimations of the potential realization of the fundamental life values, and the "organization" is related with the positive estimation of the realization of the 'outer' values while 'disorganization' and spontaneity correspond with the positive estimation of the realization of the 'inner', intra-oriented values. The qualities of the "alienation" correspond with the moderate or negative estimations of the realization of the fundamental values in the urban environment, and the qualities of the 'disorganized alienation' characterized mostly by moderate or negative estimations of the realization of the 'domination' values, while 'organized alienation' is characterized by negative estimations of realization of all fundamental values, especially 'personal' goal-achievement ones.
   Finally, the distribution of the characteristics of the identification with the city (M. Lally scale) in the categorical space shows that the qualities of the 'spontaneous authenticity' related to the strong emotional affection towards the city; the 'organized authenticity' related to the common past experienced by the person, the outer value of the city and the aims, associated with the city. The qualities of the 'organized alienation' correspond with the low emotional affection and the outer value of the city, while the qualities of the 'disorganized alienation' correspond with the low emotional affection and the nearly absent association between the aims of the individual and his/her perception of the city.
   In sum, it should be noted that the personal characteristics of the self-discipline seem to be strongly dependent on if the life values and estimations of their potential realization in the urban environment are conditioned by the inner or outer source. At the same time, characteristics of the person's self-identity condition his/her positive or negative/indifferent estimation of the urban environment and opportunities for the life fulfilment.

DE philosophy of language; logic; epicheireme; hypothetical syllogism;

AB In this paper, we carried out the reconstruction of the logical reasoning of ancient authors in the so-called "Democritus' epicheiremes" and counter arguments (refutations), presented in the alleged Proclus' "Commentary" on the "Cratylus".
   The term "epicheireme", used by Proclus in relation to Democritus' arguments, has a very broad meaning. It is a well-known interpretation of epicheireme, based on the categorical syllogism, consisting of two enthymemes. However, epicheireme could also be treated as the advanced version of modus ponens, modus tollens (hypothetical syllogisms), or polysyllogism (multi-premise), sorites, lemmatic inference or even inductive hypothesis. The difficulty lies in the fact that over time, especially after Aristotle's rhetoric, the concept of enthymeme and epicheireme have gone beyond the logic to the poorly defined rhetorical discourse, dealing with certain ways of "dialectical" reasoning, probabilistic statements or rhetorical figures, losing a direct connection with demonstrative syllogisms.
   In our view, the arguments of Democritus and the Proclus' subsequent refutation can be considered from a logical point of view; understanding epicheireme more logically than rhetorically. In this paper, we develop arguments for such a reconstruction. If we take into account that ancient authors often did not distinguish enthymeme and epicheireme, then at least we have a certain stratum of deductive arguments and refutations, which may be explicated by identifying the necessary structural units implicitly involved in the argumentation.
   The paper reveals the structure of four epicheiremes, arranged in modus tollens of Theophrastus' hypothetical syllogism, as well as Proclus' criticism, asserting the categorical premises of hypothetical reasoning expressed by negative statements. The conceptual features of ancient linguistic naturalism and relativism in regard to the semantics of names are analyzed.
   The article focuses on the awakening of research interest to the ancient heritage of logic and philosophy of language.

DE Hannah Arendt; judgment; political responsibility; ethics; extraordinary
AB This article is devoted to the problem of personal and political responsibility in works of Hannah Arendt, the German-American political theorist. Her main study on this subject, "Eichmann in Jerusalem", is presented as an argument against theory of national interest and its main contributor Carl Schmitt. The main contradiction point between two authors lies in the question: under what circumstances ethical and political theories fail to evaluate personal decisions as good or bad? Nazi functionaries after World War II used to blame country's government for crimes against humanity, claiming to be just doing what is necessary for the survival of a society. According to Arendt, any totalitarian regime and all its public activities have another purpose: to eliminate all traditional social institutes and to turn society into the multitude of atomised individuals. Measure of guilt is therefore defined by measure of participation in these activities, and this unprecedented situation can be solved only by international trial. Under these circumstances person can remain innocent only by avoiding any form of political participation and responsibility.
   This recipe is unacceptable for Car Schmitt, who has been working on the problems of political decisionism and sovereignty since early years of Weimar Republic. He claims that it is the ability to act under the state of emergency, when regular law becomes irrelevant, which defines political sovereign from random groups of common people. Despite his well-known unofficial title of "crown jurist of the Third Reich", in his early works Schmitt appears to support democratic republican government and to show it a possible way through future crises - a way which he sees in dictatorial authority.
   We can see a deep distinction between two these approaches to similar problematics. Arendt is concentrated mostly on acts and motives of individual person, which she sees as a fulfilment of human free will and a foundation of inevitable responsibility at the same time. Schmitt focuses on military and police practices of decision-making, such as juridical norm of martial law, which he describes as instruments of overcoming state of emergency. But the collective analysis of these two authors allows us to see the implicit dispute between them and to go deeply into both their theories.

DE practical turn; social practice; social reality; social theory
AB The article presents different forms of practical turn in social theory by identifying their initial motives, methods of argumentation, and the implications for social science. It is shown that a significant contribution to the formation of a practical perspective of social reality analysis was made by the works of A. Gehlen, H. Arendt, M. Foucault, P. Bourdieu, A. Giddens, P. Sztompka, M. Archer. The criticism of practical turn is specially researched. The author asks the question whether different forms of practical turn in social theory have a convergent effect, allowing to say that the accumulated theoretical generalizations have results which are impossible to get by classical social theory. The answer is that the practical perspective of social reality analysis suggests the refusal to interpret social practice as a secondary effect, the origins of which lie in other areas (conscious or unconscious, subjective actions or social structures). The practical turn is characterized by the expansion and redefinition of conceptual dictionary of social science, that` s saying about the renewal of the categorical framework of social theory and indicate not only about a search for the relevant language of social reality description, but also the creation of new ontology of the social. Another aspect of the practical perspective is the recognition of the materiality of social reality, which appears in the corporeal nature of social actions and structures, allowing to observe them, and in the involvement of subjects of the physical world in social practices.

   Pyrrhonism; Self-Refutation
ID SELF-REFUTATION
AB The goal of Sextus Empiricus' philosophy implies achieving the tranquility of soul (ataraxia), which is reached through investigation of scientific and philosophical beliefs. Sceptic comes to conclusion, Sextus says, that conflicting beliefs have equal persuasiveness, which allows him to suspend judgement about truth and falsity of any issues under investigation.
   At the same time Sextus uses powerful arguments of negative dogmatic nature, what provides reasons to some scholars to contend Sextus' insincerity and inconsistency. Indeed, we come to strange results, undertaking analysis of the Relativity Mode. If we reconstruct arguments, contained in the Mode, we can see that the main premise of the Mode is an assumption that relative knowledge of the things is not the proper one, for it cannot reveal their real nature. For the being of things in themselves is assumed as absolute and not relative one. Every relative predicate then does not reveal the real properties of the things in themselves. Assuming this, one should certain conclude that things are incomprehensible, which means in its turn taking agnosticism. However this takes no place in Sextus' case at the end of every Mode he declares necessity of suspending judgement.
   This issue raises the main problem of this paper. I argue that Sextus has sufficient means to refute those hasty charges sketched above. So it is proposed an apologetic interpretation based on so called "dialectical strategy", which can be traced to Socrates and which was inherited by Sextus through Arcesilaus. It consists in hypothetical assuming premises and deduction rules of opponents (dogmaticists), and revealing internal contradictions of their accounts. As example of such strategy could be taken a special way of skeptical speaking, which is described by "phainestai rule" (K. Vogt). According to this rule the pyrrhonian sceptic makes no statements, but just utters about his perceptions and mental states. It means that the sceptic have a special skeptical propositional attitude, according to which he makes no truth claims but he is just reasoning from the dogmatist's point of view. Thus we reach a point that the sceptic doesn't argue truth of premises and deduction rules, and thereby is not committed to their conclusions. This shows why the sceptic isn't entitled to claim agnosticism as consequence of his reasoning.
   However this interpretation calls an account of isosthenia in question, which I'll undertake in the following paper.

AB The term << live portrait >> is introduced by the author to analyse a particular case of political communication in Russia, when the authority represents itself ritually to the people. Such a one-sided communication is called upon to demonstrate the existence of the political leader, to appease the people's anxieties. To specifically acknowledge this, three historical examples of such ritual effects are used in which the << live portraits >> became tsar Aleksey Mikhailovich, leader Joseph Stalin and president Vladimir Poutine. The portrait canons highlighted by the author, act as an explanation to the ritual- represtative character of cases of political communication: 1) << the uniform >>, which schematizes the ruler prior to the live portrait; 2) the static pose as a ritual particularity of << portrait communication >> ; 3) a particular ruler as a << form or presentation >>. The core of the phenomenon of the << live portrait >> is in the existence of the Representative.

DE disability; disability studies; genealogy of term
AB The anthropological turn in philosophy of the twenty-first century initiates an appeal to the concepts that previously did not cause philosophical interest. The terms "disabled" and "disability" are in their series. The relevance of the analysis of the genealogy of these concepts appears because of difficulties in determining their value, which is found not only at the stage of medical examination referring to a specific disability group, but also as a result of the ambiguity of meaning that this concept carries.
   The modern processes of globalization, coupled with the social determinants of health, create uncertainty and complicate long-term forecasting of norms and standards of health and non-health, including disability. The concept is blured what makes complicated the framing of its borders. The decision to bring the meanings of pluralism to the unity of values taken by WHO. With background of interdisciplinarization WHO as an intersectoral actor finds solution for contradiction and ambiguity in "umbrella term" concept, which laid the basis for the concept of disability. This step is explained as the attempt to unite the existing definitions of disability at one and to create a unified discourse. But in this case, there are new challenges. For example, how to deal with too broad and abstract definition and its variations in the same paragraph on the website of WHO?
   To solve the difficulties of the definition with the background of arising pluralism of opinions, it is necessary to recognize the heterogeneity and relativism of the concept - instead of the ghosting of the concept to unity values. The concept of disability as a umbrella term explained complex phenomena, does not meet the demands of modern times. The convention between stakeholders is required in the existence of heterogeneous positions for its working well with each other and in different contexts.
   The reader is invited to address "back to the heterogeneity", but in a new holographically way, not complex. To do this, it is important to explicate pluralism and relativism of concepts by identifying historical forms and meanings of the disability concept and its possible ( philosophical, cultural, medical etc.) interpretations.

DE disability; public sphere; public discourse; semiotics of visibility
AB Modern technologies and social networks make people with disabilities active and visible in the public sphere. The "otherness" of the private life of a person with disability is brought in the focus of art and media projects, programs of social research. But the appearance of the category of disability in the public sphere is still understudied. The article reveals theoretical and methodological resources of the concepts of public sphere for sociological interpretations and empirical measurements of the disability issues. The author discusses the controversial nature of the existing theoretical models of disability understanding. The comparison of the classical model of public sphere by J. Habermas and modern discoursive and semiotic theories are exposed. The frontiers between the "discourse" and the "public sphere" issues are specified. Modern alternative approaches to public sphere understanding provide the researchers with clearer interpretations and measurements of spatial and content characteristics of public sphere of disability. The "semiotic of visibility" opens new perspectives, which enable the important role of the symbolic interactions and political conflict in different types of public spaces and relevant discussions. The empirical illustrations show, how and when the category of disability become visible in public sphere. As far as what effects and constrains different modes of visibility can bring to the public understanding of the category of disability and the identity of the community of people with disabilities.

TI THE ARYAN MYTH IN THE NATIONALISMS OF MODERN TATARSTAN
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Aryan myth; Bulgars; Tatars; Kryashens; nationalism; Hyperborea;
   neo-paganism
AB The features of the functioning of the Aryan myth in the nationalisms of the Republic of Tatarstan, the subject of Russian Federation, are analyzed. The spread of this myth in the post-Soviet space is ascertained. According to the author, this problem is insufficiently studied on the materials of Tatarstan. In solving the research problem, an appeal to the Aryan myth by representatives of the Bulgarian, Tatar, Kryashen and Russian nationalisms has been identified. As part of "Bulgarism" the Aryan myth is used by M. Z. Zakiev, F. G.-Kh. Nurutdinov and others to overcome the autochthonism of the Volga Bulgars (one of the ancestors of the Kazan Tatars) and to search for prestigious ancestors and large government entities of Eurasia in the Antiquity and the Middle Ages. The author hypothesized that the " Bulgarists" borrowed the basic elements of the myth from Russian neo-pagans nationalists and " processed" them. " Aryanism" in the Tatar nationalism can be a potential alternative or complement to the myth of the Golden Horde, but up to the present it was not widely actualized in this discourse (R. S. Khakimov, V. M. Lantsov, K. M. Ziatdinov and others). Kryashen historians and publicists (M. S. Glukhov, V. A. Maksimov) used the Aryan myth to justify the fact that the Kryashens was an ancient independent people with a non-tatar ethnogenesis. The Russian version of the Aryan myth in research works, journalism and museum exhibitions of Tatarstan is unexpectedly broadly presented. The academic apologist of the Aryan myth and Hyperborea is Doctor of Historical Sciences, Professor Irina A. Gataullina. Arguing in the framework of traditionalism, the former communist ideologist retells the myths of contemporary Russian neo-pagans in her articles, and reproduces them in the textbook History (Kazan, 2014) intended for students. The textbook also describes ancient aircrafts, on which the Atlanteans and the Hyperboreans allegedly made intercontinental flights; views of racists J. A. Gobineau, G. Wirth, R. Guenon and othes; polycentricity close to polygenism-the idea of human races as different biological species, Slavs as " defenders of Troy", etc. In Tatarstan, the Aryan myth is also promoted in articles and interviews of the journalist G. Zaynullina. In the author's opinion, a wide popularization of the artist K. Vasiliev, whose museum was opened in the most lively and attractive for a tourists street in the center of Kazan, can contribute to a more massive expansion of the Aryan myth. The author made a conclusion about the use of the Aryan myth as a tool in the nationalisms of modern Tatarstan. It is interesting for amateur and professional historians. The latter defended their theses (often in the Soviet period) on the problems of the history of the 20th century, and appealed to ancient times, including the Aryan myth in the 1990s and the 2000s. The danger of actualization of the Aryan myth from the referred sources in Russian political discourse is stated.

TI ABORIGINAL "SMALL TOWNS" OF THE LOWER OB OF THE 16TH-17TH CENTURIES:
   PROBLEMS OF IDENTIFICATION AND CORRELATION OF WRITTEN AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL
   SOURCES
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE North-Western Siberia; " small towns"; Ugric principalities; written and
   archaeological sources
AB The paper addresses key issues related to the identification of information about the location and the history of a particular kind of monuments (referred to as " small towns") on the territory of the North-Western Siberia in written and cartographic sources of the 16th18th centuries. The main goal set by the author was the full collection, analysis and synthesis of a variety of sources and attempts to implement them for the study of settlement structures of the indigenous population of the northern Trans-Urals. The short historiographical essay is of interest in the chosen topic to specialists in different disciplines of the humanities. An important place is given to the criticism of the documents and their correlation problems. The source base of the research includes: the text of the first geographic description of Western Siberia from the Book of the Big Drawing (late 16th -early 18th centuries), the drawings from the first Russian atlases by S. U. Remezov (late 17th -early 18th centuries), travel notes by G. F. Miller (1730s-1740s), assembly documents and ethnographic data by pre-revolutionary and contemporary researchers. During the presentation of the material the emphasis is put on the possibility and the importance of studying toponymic material. In the course of the research, issues that are extremely important for the modern science of history have been identified. They include, in particular: identification of features of political entities of Ugric population during the period under review and definition of the concept of " small town". Working with the selected complex of the materials in the first stage of the research allowed revealing 38 " small towns" in the study area. They were further divided into 4 typological groups. The main criterion for the distribution of " small towns" by groups was their presence in various sources. On the basis of the dating of the sources it was possible to build the chronology of the sites and to identify previously unknown information which is highly relevant for further research. " Small towns", known from the archaeological data, have become a special group of identified sites. Their example shows the basic methods of identifying and comparing " small towns" from various sources. In the study, the author has come to an important conclusion about the possibility of using the selected set of sources, in which data from one document can be double-checked and possibly even extended by information from other documents. The accuracy of written and cartographic sources allows hoping for positive results of archaeological research in the framework of the topic.

TI FROM THE "BASCARDI" TO THE "BASHKIRS": THE FATE OF AN ETHNONYM DURING

LA Russian
DT Article
DE "Bascardi"; "Bashkirs"; nomadic Ugrians; Magna Hungaria; Bolghar; Golden
   Horde; Kazan Khanate; Nogai Horde
AB Research objectives: To analyse information of the sources of the 13th-16th centuries regarding the "Bascardi", "Pascatur", "Baschirdi", "Bashkirds", "Bashkirs" (together with other variations) and to study the interrelation of these ethnonyms and the historical fate of those who bore them.
   Research materials: In addition to written sources (Latin, Russian and Arabic), materials from archaeological research, linguistic data, epigraphy, historical ethnology and climatology.
   Research results and novelty: Prior to the Mongol-Tatar invasion, "Magna Hungaria", located east of Bolghar, was inhabited by the "Bascardi" who, according to written sources and archaeology, belonged to the nomadic Ugrians and consisted mostly of pagans. During the Great western campaign of the Mongols, most of the Cisuralic Ugrians ("Bascardi") perished or left this territory (one part of the population fled from the invaders and the other one was deported). During the Golden Horde period, Muslim Turks from the Bolghar and Central Asia settled in the Cisuralic region and gradually assimilated the remains of the "Bascardi" of the Southern Cis-Urals. In the 15th-16th centuries, the ethnonyms "Baschirdi", "Bashkirs" and the like are not associated with the Southern Cis-Urals, but with more northern territories - that is, with the upper reaches of the Kama. Due to serious climatic and political changes that began in the 1550s (one of the climatic minima of the Little Ice Age, the fall of the Kazan Khanate, and turbulence combined with epidemics in the Nogai Horde), the "Bashkirs" began to move to the Southern Cis-Urals, as is evidenced by the sources of the late 16th-17th centuries.

TI BIG CHALLENGES IN THE HISTORY OF IMPERIAL RUSSIA: CIVILISATIONAL AND

SO QUAESTIO ROSSICA

DT Article
DE history of Russia; civilisational identity; civilisational status;
   geopolitics; modernization; poly-ethnicity; expansionism
AB This article is devoted to one of the most complicated issues of Russian history, i.e. the challenges of modernity, which are viewed through the prism of the concept of modernisation (used to describe the transition from a traditional agrarian society to an industrial and urban one). A historical challenge is a complex category, not a simple action "to spite the arrogant neighbour". One of the main reasons for its emergence is technological revolutions that fundamentally change the conditions of human communities. Typologies of challenges vary from natural and climatic to social and political. Russia has come across many of them. Civilisational, geopolitical, technological, socio-political, cultural, and ideological challenges are the most typical of the imperial period. Their research discusses the characteristics of the essence of a challenge, the need to understand it, respond to it, the struggle of opinions about the reaction to them, and the evaluation of the results achieved. As an example of this approach, the authors consider two of the aforementioned challenges. In Russian historiography, the concept of "challenges" is not uncommon, but quite often the reaction to them did not take into account the dynamics of modernisation. The method put forward by the authors, based on the "challenges and responses" scheme, makes it possible to bridge this gap and provides practically meaningful results without them being ready-made recipes. Preliminary conclusions about two of the indicated challenges demonstrate that they were only slowly understood by the Russian ruling elite, which resulted in the cataclysms of the First World War and the Revolution of 1917 that put Russia on the brink of a civilisational catastrophe, although one should not forget that in the course of the period under study the country turned into a power of world significance.

AB The article is devoted to the problem of the development of the Anglo-French cooperation mainly in the military sphere during the David Cameron two cabinets: the D. Cameron-N. Clegg coalition and D. Cameron conservative cabinets. The research scrutinizes the reigniting of the bilateral cooperation by signing the Lancaster agreements on military, industrial and technological cooperation between Britain and France (2010) and other different agreements up to 2016. The bilateral cooperation is described like "an affair of equals" with equal military power and global reach. The author stresses the significance of the Anglo-French cooperation for strengthening the dominating military role of NATO under the EU military dimension (CFSP/CSDP). The study also underlines the importance of this cooperation for improving the British relationship with the U.S. which political and military interests since the end of the Cold War have been shifted from the European security to affairs in the Asia-Pacific region. The author pays attention to the Franco-British lead in the Libyan military company against M. Kaddafi in 2011 and to participation of these two countries in imposing sanctions on Russia during the Ukrainian crisis. The article shows the process of elaborating by the two countries of the consolidated position on Syrian civil war and on creation of the terrorist organization - "The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant" (ISIL). The research highlights in details the very path of all directions of cooperation during the last six years. Special attention of the study is paid to cooperation in testing of French and British nuclear missiles in two newly created special laboratories in France and in the United Kingdom. The analysis also scrutinizes the implementation of the Lancaster and other Anglo-French agreements on such issues as creation of the Combined Joint Expeditionary Force (CJEF), elaboration of technologies for production of the strategic missile SCALP/Storm Shadow, construction of nuclear power stations in the UK and interaction on immigration crisis. The author attempts to answer the question whether the bilateral cooperation will last for a long time and what its ignition means for international relations.

DT Editorial Material
DE sovereignty; international institutions; the right of peoples to
   self-determination; historical; political and legal processes
AB The international legal right of peoples to self-determination is an integral part of the basis for the formation of an independent state. The most acute problems are with those regions that seceded from the Soviet Union in political and military conflicts and now seek recognition of sovereign status. Until the middle of XX century, such recognition was achieved following global military conflict, and then following the struggle against colonialism. In the past three decades, it has been associated mostly with the destruction of totalitarian regimes. This study is analysis the formation of the unrecognized state and historical, political and legal processes in a changing world political environment, and the implementation of the right of peoples to self-determination. The modern search for optimal forms of self-determination subject to the ideas of external and internal forms predetermines the scientific analysis of the historical political and legal formation of statehood in the territories for which the implementation of the right of peoples to self-determination is problematic. Here we examine the example of the Republic of Abkhazia. The methodological basis of research is the systemic approach that allows a holistic view of political and legal processes in the state. We also use comparative, structural-functional and historical approaches. The current status of the Republic of Abkhazia at its present stage of development is "denied," which affects its political and legal system, characterized by a mixture of traditional and modern state and legal institutions. The state and the law in Abkhazia largely depend on the geopolitical situation in the region and the world, as well as the political systems of its neighbors and strategic allies. Quite a large role in the formation of Abkhazian statehood and its legal system is played by the Russian Federation, which has influenced power structures of the Republic of Abkhazia so as to integrate them into a single economic, political and legal space. Conclusions: The state and the legal system of the Republic of Abkhazia are in a state of transition and undergoing synchronization with the state and legal system of the Russian Federation in in order to establish a sovereign state. The status of an unrecognized state makes it impossible for the Republic of Abkhazia to fully participate in international processes and slows down the possible impact of international legal institutions on its state legal system.

DT Article
DE Revolution 1917; propaganda; methodology; anti-Russian myths;
   ideologies; history
AB The article analyzes the anti-Russian historical narrative focused on the 1917 events. The relevance of the theme is determined by the wide-ranging discussion on the Russian revolution due toits anniversary.
   The authors solve the problem of the scientific criticism of the anti-Russian myths, focused on the assessments and interpretations of the two Russian revolutions of 1917.
   In the article there are shown the ideological basis and political context of the coverage of the events of 1917. The authors analyze 5 historical ideologemes, which are disseminated in the public consciousness. They also show the cognitive and political implications of adopting the respective ideology.
   As a typical liberal myth, the authors regard the interpretation of the October Revolution as "stolen freedom" provided by the February revolution. In the article there is shown that through the myth of "stolen freedom" the whole history of Russia is presented as a reproduction of the "totalitarian regime". The authors prove the incorrectness of showing Bolsheviks as the initiators of the use of mass terror tactics, to which all major opposing forces resorted. There is considered the connection of the interpretation of the Revolution as the manifestation of the "Russian rebellion" with the Russophobic myth of the Russian barbarism. The authors criticize the idea of the Bolshevik imperialism, which is allegedly based on the ideology of world revolution. The article gives the deconstruction of the myth of the Bolshevik regime illegitimacy and shows the cognitive contradictions of the attempts to counter the concepts of "October Revolution" and "October Coup". The authors reveal that the thesis of the Constituent Assembly, as an illustration of the Bolshevik illegitimacy, doesn't correspondent to the historical facts.
   The authors conclude that the issues of covering the events of both the Revolution and the Great Patriotic War are linked to the national security of Russia.

LA English
DT Article
AB Ekaterina Boltunova's article analyzes historical narrative as presented at the Yeltsin Center in Yekaterinburg, a memorial complex dedicated to the first president of Russia. The idea, which was conceived after Boris Yeltsin's death in 2007, seems to be an example of truly global thinking, modeled on American presidential memorials. The center was founded not in Moscow but in Yekaterinburg, where the future president's political career began. An American company was hired to carry out the project according to the best world standards. Boltunova reveals the story of the development of the exposition's narrative and interprets its semiotics of power. At the same time, she points to a competing local historical scenario represented by a church-sponsored cult of Nicholas II. Boltunova claims that the center, in a conscious effort to overcome the Soviet imperial legacy, drew on an archaic political scenario of the sacralization of supreme power, or rather -the personality of the ruler.

TI THE CONCEPT OF NATION: RUSSIAN AND EUROPEAN CONTEXTS
SO QUAESTIO ROSSICA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE nation; nationalism; narod; national self-determination; nationstate;
   state-nation
AB In his recent book, the renowned expert on nationalism Aleksei Miller aims to make a comparative historical analysis of how the idea of the nation has been evolving in the Russian and European contexts, and, secondly, to introduce fundamental concepts and approaches to the problems of nationalism in world science. To examine the dynamics of the concept of nation, the author relies on the methods of conceptual history put forward by Reinhart Koselleck, the history of political discourse and thought by Quentin Skinner and J. G. A. Pocock, discourse analysis by Michel Foucault, and concepts of cultural, conceptual, and institutional transfers. The author follows the adventures of the concept of "nation" on Russian soil, which is of readily apparent interest and novelty. Miller starts from the Petrine era when, as he supposes, the concept was borrowed from Europe as a result of diplomatic contacts. As early as the eighteenth century, the word "nation" was used in two ways: on the one hand, as a counterpart to the word "narod" that had been previously used in the Russian language and, on the other hand, in its European meaning of a noble corporation and a sovereign state. An important advantage of the book is that Miller's review of the "nation" concept includes recent political events. He analyses the effectiveness of "nation-state" and "statenation" patterns, and explains the semantic difference between the frequently used notions of "Russian" and "Russia's" and between the English "national self-determination" and its Russian counterpart. Despite its undoubted relevance and usefulness, the book leaves a number of questions open. First of all, although its title is Nation or the Power of Myth, the book says nothing about myth - neither the concept nor its relation to "nation". The author does not give a clear definition of the "nationalisation of dynasty" or his "beforeafter" opposition, which are crucial for his speculation. He does not comment on his alternative name for the well-known concept of imagined communities by Benedict Anderson. Inspecting historical examples of states to illustrate the dynamics of "nation" and nationalism, Miller leaves out the Habsburg monarchy, although it provided one of the most striking cases in the history of nation-building and national movements. Finally, the principle on which footnotes have been included is unclear throughout the text.

AB The article deals with the history of the National bloc in Iran that demonstrates an example of the combination of ideological and pragmatic inclinations in the Soviet foreign policy of the early 1920s. The renunciation of the "export of revolution" strategy and the transition to the support of the Iranian independence demanded the appropriate forms of work with the local political forces. B.Z. Shumyatsky, a creator of the bloc, conceived it as a social basis for the "national" government to come, which would set Iran on the path of development and independence.
   However, during the first months of its existence, the National bloc confronted with a number of contradictions, which contributed to its final defeat. Shumyatsky's striving to overthrow Qavam al-Saltaneh led to the extension of the bloc ranks in the Majles with the representatives of the various rival groups and made it an amorphous and unstable coalition. Similarly, the slogan for the struggle against "foreigners" charged against the bloc, when the cabinet of Mostoufi al-Mamalek was discredited by the opponents as the Moscow's protong. At the same time, structural and ideological feebleness of the Iranian parties and the trade unions of those years hampered the bloc's transformation into the mass and centralized political power.
   The influence of war minister (later Prime Minister) Reza Khan and Moscow's support of his centralization activity led the National bloc into the alliance with that political figure. As a result, the bloc quickly passed the way from the separate political project to the junior partner of the coalition and finally faced with the changed plans of the military dictator to leave the political stage.

AB Economic man and his behavior in modern economic psychology and social sciences are considered narrowly from the standpoints of social peculiarities of behavior and motives of receiving a profit in market economy. But the socialization of man takes place under conditions of widening an artificial innovation habitat - technosphere and the destruction of natural environment which affects the peculiarities of human social and natural characteristics, and it is accompanied by their changes. Social and natural processes determined by a technospheric expansion affect directly and indirectly subjects of economic activity. Globalizing technogenic socium (as a result of dangerous actions and their consequences in sufficiently comprehended by philosophy, economy, psychology, sociology, political science and other sciences) transforms nature and man himself forming new regularities of human behavior under technogenic conditions of life. That is why, it is necessary to expand the applied methodology for the comprehension of human manner in social sciences having included the interrelated social-economic and natural changes in man in the field of their consideration under conditions of social-technogenic development of the world.

TI Demographic Theories and the Regional Aspect of Population Ageing
SO ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CHANGES-FACTS TRENDS FORECAST
LA Russian
DT Article
DE demographic ageing; age structure of the population; older generation
AB Population ageing is a major demographic trend of our time. The increase in the proportion and number of elderly people requires that the governments of "ageing" countries develop measures to mitigate the effects of demographic ageing reflected in two interrelated aspects: maintaining sustainable socio-economic development and ensuring a decent quality of life for the elderly. At the same time, as the experience of developed and developing countries shows, in order to ensure effective implementation of the measures it is necessary to take into consideration regularities and territorial features of the age structure transformation. The relevance of our research is determined by the need for scientific understanding of the process of demographic ageing taking into account the system nature of its characteristics (global nature and inevitability in terms of the narrowed reproduction of the population) and the multiplicity of implications for socio-economic development. The aim of our research is to identify the regularities and regional features of population ageing. We carry out the research with the use of general scientific methods (logical and system approaches, structural-functional analysis, generalization), statistical methods (grouping, sampling, comparison, and generalization), as well as graphical and tabular methods of data visualization. The article presents a review of theoretical concepts that define the essence of the process of population ageing and the results of a comprehensive statistical analysis of the main indicators of changes in the age structure in retrospect and in prospect. We conclude that the nature of the process of population ageing is dialectical: on the one hand, it has been proven that there are phases of demographic transition universal for all countries; on the other hand it has been revealed that the specifics of change in the age structure of local areas differ in the time of passage of these phases, intensity of increase in the number of elderly population, as well as the influence of factors that are external in relation to the demographic system (e.g., economic and political situation in the country, wars, disasters, etc.). Areas that have a comparable proportion of the elderly in the population can vary significantly according to quality characteristics of this socio-demographic group. In this regard, there is a practical need to obtain objective and relevant information about the situation in contemporary Russian and Mongolian societies; it is also necessary to develop a set of measures to adjust socio-economic development taking into account the specifics revealed.

The documents of the Council for Religious Affairs under the Council of Ministers of the USSR for the 1960s - 1970s allow to analyze the conformity of the activities of the most mass religious associations led by the Russian Orthodox Church to three main criteria that allowed the state to come to a conclusion about the degree of loyalty of a particular faith: the legality, the behavior of the clergy, the transfer of financial resources in favor of quasi-public organizations. The article concludes that the Brezhnev era was a time of co-adaptation of power and the overwhelming majority of confessions in the USSR.

AB It is established that the specifics of politological approach to studying the phenomenon of opposition consists in the fact that it focuses on the main attributive features of opposition as the carrier of protest, "alternative" interests, namely, on opposition's organization and its aspiration to acquire power. The connection of political participation and political opposition has a dual character. On the one hand, the political opposition acts as one of the institutes of participation, a sort of intermediary which gives citizens the opportunity to participate in political life of the country. On the other hand, the opposition is one of the group agents of participation. The main channel of acquisition of the political capital for oppositional subjects is electoral process as the period of the greatest intensification of political life of the country, manifestation of the political orientations by citizens.
   Thus, the authors base their study on the politological discourse in order to investigate the opposition as a political subject. They also reveal the determinants of political opposition's participation in the electoral process ( character of a political regime, a sociocultural context, a condition of the competitive environment, parameters of self-identification of political subjects. It is proved that subjectivity of political opposition within the electoral process reveals in the formation of consolidated "negative consensus" in relation to the power for the purpose of mobilizing the protest moods of population. When forming a uniform electoral strategy of actions, the opposition uses information opportunities for the purpose of articulating the "new" agenda and organizing different street protests.
   E.V. Efanova has designated approaches to the operationalization of the phenomenon of opposition, systematized the types of political opposition. N.Yu. Veremeev has defined characteristics of opposition as a subject of electoral process, revealed the factors of participation of political opposition in elections.

TI 'Tradition' as an element in the discourse of political philosophy
SO FILOSOFSKII ZHURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE historicism; historical politics; tradition; rationalism in politics;
   conservatism; liberalism
AB The present article attempts to consider 'tradition', one of the most frequently used terms In Russian ideological discourse over the recent years, as a valid notion in political philosophy. The author traces down the tangled history of this concept, aiming to reveal the political meaning of the philosophical discussions around it. She shows that the principal content of such discussions has invariably been the dilemma of reason vs tradition which originated in the political philosophy of the modern age to become the foundation of two distinct political ontologies. At the heart of the first of these ontologies is the idea of an unconditioned, autonomous reason capable of reforming the world of human relations in accordance with the laws of justice, elaborated by its own mediation, and intent on shaping a new world where all the prejudices and traditions of the past are abandoned. The other ontology, conversely, is based on heteronomous reason which is conditioned in its development by historic experience and tradition; it is from the latter that it derives the laws of social and institutional progress. Contemporary philosophy is aiming at finding such a solution to the dilemma that would still allow to maintain a tension between its two poles and to imbue them with new philosophical and political meaning. Among the new problems thus revealed is the problem of how following a tradition combines with the idea of freedom, or whether tradition at all admits transformation and change and how it can be related to transcendentals in historical thinking. The author arrives at the conclusion that archaism is the inevitable outcome of only that kind of historical politics which regards tradition as sacral without taking into account its controversial logic.

Mutahhari was working on his ideology, which could be: first, a realistic alternative to Shah Reza Pahlavi's ideological doctrine and the theories of Islamic Marxists, and secondly, the acceptable source of legitimacy of Islamic Rule. Islamic theories of political structure have traditionally evolved as a result of philosophical reflection on the fundamental problems, such as: the understanding of God and the relationship between God and world, God and man, the basis of just governance of Islamic society and Islamic state and so on. The close relationship between religion, philosophy and politics was reflected most clearly in Mutahhari' discourse: he recognizes the need to establish the form of Islamic government in Iran and creates for its justification a special ideology, using the statements of Islamic doctrine and Islamic values.

AB Introduction: the article is devoted to the analysis of the genesis of the Soviet theory of law, in particular, of the sociological concept of law by P. Stuchka. In this regard, the relation of jurisprudence with other social sciences, such as philosophy, political science and sociology, acquires particular importance. Special attention is paid to the attempts of reconciliation of Marx's concept of withering away of the state and the law in a communist society with the realities of the young Soviet state. Purpose: to form a concept of prerequisites and peculiarities of formation of Russian legal theory in the 1920-30s. Methods: theoretical methods of formal and dialectic logic have been applied. Results: the analysis shows that in their attempt to reconcile Marxist theory with the reality and inner logic of the law the Soviet jurists relied on the achievements of pre-revolutionary Russian legal theory, primarily a sociological theory of law. In addition, the relative epistemic pluralism of social sciences in the first decades of the Soviet regime allowed them to elaborate original concepts, for example, the concept of codification. Conclusions: the Soviet theory of law in its early stages faced the problems of determining the essence and the content of law, and of the relationship between the law, state and society of a new type. The problems were caused by the dominant ideology of Marxism-Leninism and epistemological obstacles in legal knowledge. The attempts to solve these problems undertaken by the Soviet jurists are of great interest to modern legal theorists who are in search for appropriate methods of legal research.

AB This review represents a monograph by Andrei Dvornichenko Yurievich professor of St. Petersburg State University, Doctor of History. His work is dedicated to a historiographical analysis of a significant number of works regarding the Russian medieval period and problems related to the genesis of the social and political structure of Ancient Rus'. The attention of researcher was concentrated not only on the evolution of historians' opinions in regard to topical questions about the progress of society and government of the Eastern Slavs, but also at unreasonable, as the researcher maintains, stereotyped representations, established in national historiography. The author has relied on metaphors that quite accurately reflect the idea of work that was conceived and realized to present his ideas. As a result, the monograph demonstrates original means of analysing historical concepts and offers an informal view of the historian's work to its readers. This work is very valuable because at this moment it is the only monograph that reviews controversial aspects of modern historiography dedicated to the history of Ancient Rus'. The same interest represents an emotional part of the text that sincerely and openly reflects uneasy relations within scientific and teaching institutions and research centers. Such circumstances add unquestionable uniqueness to this work. Many of the author's comments are arguable but he definitively identifies the most critical moments of modern historical research on both conceiving the field of studying mediaeval Rus' and national historians' works in common. His work is an invitation to conversation. Many conclusions of Professor A. Dvornichenko are disappointing but the fact they are reflected in a significant body research brings hope that crisis in modern Russian science will be resolved. Refs 9.

TI MYTH IN THE STRUCTURE OF NATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS
SO JOURNAL OF FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
DE Nations; Ethnicity; National consciousness; Myth; Globalization
AB In the context of globalization processes, the problem of nations and national self-consciousness has become one of the most widely discussed in the modern social sciences and humanities. Within the framework of globalization approaches, a nation is viewed as a transitional formation between traditional locality and planetary interdependence. According to modern theories, the model of a nation is built on the basis of Western European developmental patterns. From such viewpoint, the characterization of ethnicity is rejected, as a feature of "primitive", "pre-political" societies as marginal groups doomed to assimilation into the existing structures. The central problem of ethnical belonging is the issue of origin, the restoration of cultural and historical memory and the construction of the "appropriate past", which would assist in solving the problems of the present. The core of any national culture is national-ethnic self-consciousness which is the key factor in the national identity formation. It is pointed out that certain types of myths are inseparable from the ethnic identity. Today, researchers speak of the process of "remythologization". For Russia, which has always been a multiethnic state, the problem of scientific definition of nations, ethnic groups, national and ethnic consciousness has a special practical significance. In Russia and the post-Soviet space, the activation of mythological thinking has its own specifics.

DT Editorial Material
DE BRICS countries; corporate social responsibility; Global Compact
AB Corporate social responsibility of business is becoming an increasingly relevant subject of research in political science, sociology, economics and law. The social responsibility of business is becoming the object of close attention of both governmental and non-governmental organizations, and the priority of its development is provided at the national, supranational and international levels.
   This article considers the political and legal dimensions of the model of corporate social responsibility implemented through the Global Compact as an unprecedented private initiative of the United Nations. A study of the social consequences of the Global Compact offers the opportunity to observe the development of an extremely important initiative: the dissemination of practices and models of corporate social responsibility and the possible implications of this action for society, for business and for the United Nations itself.
   Corporate social responsibility, having an internal and external dimension, social and political content, goes far beyond the formal legal aspect. At the same time, states, including the BRICS countries, interested in developing corporate social responsibility practices, by legal means, in one way or another contribute to the development of the most promising practices of the social responsibility of business from their point of view.
   The United Nations pays special attention to the private sector as a promising tool for responding to new problems arising within the international environment. The principles formulated by the United Nations in the Global Compact are reflected and developed in the documents of other international organizations, and then in the programs and regulatory documents of the participating countries, and, of course, in the various codes of large and medium-sized corporations.

   theme of power and person; national character; motive; metaphor; symbol;
   composition
AB A. Luzhikov is a modern Komi poet, the author of such poems as "Komi poem" (1988), "One story" (1994), "My Pera lamented, my bright sun" (2001). One of the characteristics of his poems is multi-layerness: fusion of historic events with mythological plots, as well as inclusion of real people along with the Komi legendary or fairytale characters into plots. A. Luzhikov's poetry reveals the poet's deepest feelings about the fate of the Komi nation, allows to understand the nature of a Komi person and his/her development in historical and mythological aspects. In "Komi poem", the author refers to the topic of political repressions in the 1930s. A. Luzhikov's writing confronts Komi poems of the Soviet period: A. Luzhikov's hero is the anti-hero, who has neither moral firmness, nor greatness of soul or an ability to overcome life hardships. De-heroization of the hero is a consequence of the de-ideologization of the society during the 1990s. The poem "My lamented Pera, my bright sun" is a lyrical and philosophical work where the author uses many structural and poetic devices of ritual funeral lamentation such as different repetitions, syntactic parallelism and formula images. A herohunter Pera from a Komi legend, the symbol of the Komi people, is mourned. Bemoaning him, the lyrical hero bemoans his own people, their greatness in the past. The poems by A. Luzhikov show a qualitatively new stage of the Komi poem development.

DT Article
DE Sweden; Swedish model; social democracy; government spending; de- and
   remarketization; privatization; social policy; labour market; power

AB The author interprets the Swedish model as that of societal engineering based principally on redistributive paradigm of the Swedish social democracy functional socialism. The basic aspects of this interpretation were published in the author's previous works, where the model's chronological framework was defined as the early 1960s and the turn of the 1980-1990s. In order to confirm the previously expressed points of view, it is attempted to operationalize this interpretation of the model through quantification of its manifestations in such important spheres as government general and social spending, de-and remarketization, privatization, social equalization policy, labour market as well as power resources of the social democracy. The analysis of changes which took place in these spheres during the above mentioned period reveals Sweden's reaching the world top positions by the mentioned indicators and the subsequent loss of this status. This is confirmed by data from the number of original tables. Thus, it becomes possible to specify the concept of the Swedish model and to verify it. The model's statistical identification conducted according to the given parameters advocates its interpretation as an essentially and chronologically specific construct (not diffused in subject-matter and in time). As a result of the research, the basic idea of the article has found confirmation. The idea is that the Swedish case has really the "individual", inherent dynamics of the whole number of key socio-economic and political macro-indicators, and that this dynamics is characteristic just for a certain historical period, namely for the final stage of industrial development and the Golden Age of the Swedish social democracy. The identification of the specificity, at both national and international levels, through the quantification of its components, can serve as a powerful argument in favor of the Swedish model notion interpretation as reflecting a conceptual and time-bound societal phenomenon.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE history; revolution; state terrorism; political philosophy; social
   dynamics; theoretical interpretation; contemporary politics; left
   radicalism
AB The article analyzes the main interpretations in modern political science and political philosophy of the phenomenon of terrorism. In the public opinion, terrorism as the most important factor of contemporary politics is often perceived in a very superficial way. Many modern interpretations of terrorism, despite their apparent objectivity have consistently produced a stencil historical logic, based on purely external perception of terrorism as a subversive activity of individuals and small groups, guided by very different political motives. The media constantly reproduce this trend, creating conventional images of terrorists in political memory and thereby false perception of the true objectives they pursue and the real corporate structures that finance and direct their activities. The article proves the thesis that despite the stable liberal stereotypes, state terrorism should be viewed as a universal matrix while all other forms of individual and group terrorism, regardless of their social, class or ideological orientation, derive from this basic source. The paper considers the specific features of revolutionary terrorism in frames of a comparison of the historical experience of the French and Russian October Revolutions. In the course of a comparative analysis, the article critically assesses the results of the interpretation of this experience in the general sociological theories of Michael Mann, Barrington Moore and Immanuel Wallerstein and political philosophy of Neo-Marxism (Terry Eagleton, Fredric Jameson). The paper proves that the adequate scientific definitions of terrorism contribute to the destruction of some historiosophical concepts, which in recent decades have transformed into stable political myths. One of the most famous of these concepts is the theory of the 'clash of civilizations.'

AB Critical analysis is presented of modern ideological trends in Russia, which belong to the large field of so called "traditionalism" (Byzantism, Neo-Eurasianism, theories based on some "primordial tradition", etc.). We survey all the spectrum of existing versions of traditionalism and then we disclose their general methodological and epistemological principles. We find that all the versions develop discursive strategies based on fictions and arbitrary manipulations. Two principal kinds of such strategies are analyzed: A) the manipulations by the chronotope (theories based on "primordial tradition"), B) the manipulation by the discourse (Byzantism). In the 1st case a simple three-step scheme is used: 1) one finds a certain "free space", a part of the historical chronotope, about which nearly nothing is known to historical science for some reasons, 2) the free space is filled by some manufactured "primordial tradition", 3) historical reality is interpreted in the prism of the manufactured fiction. This manufacturing of the "primordial tradition" is similar to the making of forgeries of antiques in the world of arts. In the 2nd case the chance to pass off arbitrary speculations as scientific theories is gained by means of mixing together sources and/or discources of incompatible nature (rational and chaotic mystical, facts and legends, etc.), which produces a discourse with no criteria of authenticity and checking-up. That's how political mystics of Russian Byzantism is constituted. We display the general model of this mystics, the "Nilus matrix", which is actively exploited today.

AB The article is devoted to the problem of interaction of power and science in Russia in the second half of the 19th century. It is emphasized that the development of science was closely connected with solving internal and foreign policy problems of the state. The author considers the participation of higher Siberian administration in the organisation of studying of Siberia. Special attention is paid to the role of the main leaders of the Si-berian regions - governor-generals and governors - in the establishment of regional scientific institutions and expeditions, the development of higher education, museums, military-topographical, statistical and meteorological services.

AB Basing on the example of the group "Retro Obninsk" in the social networking site "VKontakte", where residents of Obninsk share old photographs of the town from their home archives, I describe how "participatory historical culture" works in the condition of new media. The notion of Thelen that refers to an ethical mode of vernacular work with the past is widened and corrected considering "participatory culture" of web-platforms and its specificity for a historical web-resource. I show how via electronic infrastructure of the platform, nostalgic enchantment of the group participants with old views of their city is converted into an archive of historical knowledge, which is polyphonic, egalitarian, open to change, unstable. The group functions as a scene of Obninsk memory that unlike printed media, literature, museum exhibitions or commemorative meetings, is open for younger generations of residents who are too young to be authoritative voices of memory. "Participatory culture" implemented via commercial platform, without any explicit political agenda and off-line activity, is vulnerable for critical deconstruction. The concluding section of the paper is an attempt to show potential of such leisure groups in social networking sites for public history and formation of vernacular historical culture.

DE First Russian Empire Census; Military History; inter-ethnic relations;

AB Historical demographic research plays an important role in multi-disciplinary projects in historical, social and political sciences at the moment. It is of great importance for migration and social policy studies and also concerns economics, material and intellectual culture and inter-ethnic and inter-faith relations. The border regions with high population mobility are of particular interest. The search in the Russian State Historical Archive uncovered a complex of primary census material concerning the Russian population in the Grand Duchy of Finland. Thus it became possible to introduce previously unstudied documents, containing data on the Russian subjects, mainly military men, stationed at Helsinki, Sveaborg, Tavastgus, Torneo and a number of other garrisons into scientific use.
   Russian military men in those towns comprised quite a noticeable element in the composition of the population. It is no doubt that Russian officers and their family members were part of the town elite according to their social status, life experience, and level of education.
   Consequently the primary documents of the 1897 census give us a unique opportunity to see the demographic situation of the Russian garrisons accommodated in the Vyborg Governorate in the end of the 19th century from the inside, and add living colors related to biographies of certain people to the dry statistical picture which describes the population of the town.

AB The article analyses the Global Strategy on Foreign and Security Policy for the European Union proclaimed in June 2016 (Mogherini Strategy). Analysis is concentrated on understanding of the energy security, reflected in the document, and on potential impact of the document on the ELI-Russia energy relations. First part of the article addresses the situation in Russia energy sector and reveals particular features of the energy policy of Russia. Second part analyses basic trends of the EL/energy policy. Finally, the paper reveals how the Strategy is placing emphases in the EU energy policy and in what way this may affect Russia's interests. Mogherini Strategy reaffirms previously laid down priorities of the energy security, first of all, the security of supplies and cheap energy, while sustainable energy has receded into the background. Within the framework of recent political discussion; Mogherini Strategy regards security of supplies as a minimization of dependence on Russia. Mogherini Strategy deliberately makes no mentioning of cooperation with Russia in the energy field that is in sharp contrast with the previous EU documents. Despite ongoing commercial cooperation, Brussels is not interested in a political and regulatory dialog with Moscow. Excess of supply over demand in the EU market allows the consumers to impose their rules. The European Union acts as a game changer; which is trying to extend internal rules of the "consumer market" to the system of international deals. Russia's attempts to protect traditional rules of the "seller market" are not yielding visible success.

TI IDEOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION OF TERRORISM AS A POLITICAL TOOL

LA Russian
DT Article
DE terrorism; ideology; extremist strategy and tactics
AB This article continues the topic of the article published in the World Economy and International Relations Journal, no. 5 (2015) "Some Approaches to Interpretation of Terrorism Phenomenon", which detailed specific aspects of what motivates the lower and mid-level members of terrorist networks to get involved in terrorist activities. For decades, psychologists, political scientists and sociologists have been studying the phenomenon of terrorist activity and the motivation that makes young and often socially successful men and women join terrorist networks. Most experts believe that any explanation of terrorist activity has to be viewed in the social context of terrorists' beliefs and ideology. These have to be viewed in unique cultural, historical and political contexts. The article shows how the scientific approach toward the issue changed in the second half of the 20th century, and how it has evolved into modern understanding of the phenomenon. In the first part of the article, works of the most "prominent" terrorists - Juan-Carlos Marighella, Ernesto Che Guevara and Osama bin Laden - are analyzed. They were the first to use an organized vilolence to oppose government institutions. Modern terrorists use terror attacks to invoke public protests in societies already strained with political, social and economic conflicts. Such tactics is especially effective against authoritarian regimes that face multiple challenges in domestic and foreign policy. A cumulative effect of terrorist attacks is investigated in the context of modern media. Visual media, including TV and Internet, have contributed greatly to the degree of violent attacks' influence on public opinion. The article includes the most recent data from the hot spots where terrorist networks have grown after the fall of authoritarian regimes (from Egypt, Tunisia), or where large terrorist organizations have managed to get control over a large portion of territory, thus limiting the power of central government (Syria). The author argues that terrorism is a systemic phenomenon rooted in a set of interdependent and mutually reinforcing factors. In this new article, different elements of this system are analyzed, the ideology of terrorism as seen by experts and the perpetrators themselves is examined. Also the strategy and tactics used, the goals pursued by extremists, the application of new technologies to spread fear are investigated.

DE party system; Democratic Party; cmpykmypHble (SIC); structural reforms;
   Matteo Renzi; Populism; Five Stars Movement; labor law; constitutional
   reform; referendum; pre; term elections; Democratic party disintegration
AB The article deals with a negative result of the constitutional referendum in Italy which became another demonstration of the 'populist wave' in the Western world. It is shown that the Italian society of the early XXIst century, suffering from both traditional and newly found disorders, needs structural reforms, but neither social forces, nor political mechanisms are ready for them. Instead of a concise balance of social forces, there is a formless community divided in clans, instead of powerful parties with definite ideologies - uninfluential political actors, disintegrated political groups. The paper presents detailed characteristics of the new political elite which came to the front in recent years - the Five Stars Movement (M5S) created by the comedian actor B. Grillo as an anti-party striving for removal of the whole political establishment, replacement of the representative democracy by a direct democracy, return to the national currency, reduction of the migrant flow. Having won a quarter of parliamentary seats, the M5S exhibits an intractability sabotaging reform attempts. Matteo Renzi, the young Democratic Party leader, has proven himself as the most active reformer. Without being a heir of the left political culture, in contrast to the Party's previous leaders, he initiated its shift to the centre, which has, as shown in the article, provided him support among the creative part of managers and the middle class. The research gives a data on the content and focus of the reforms implemented by M. Renzi - the labor law liberalization, fiscal and budget innovations, new electoral law, constitutional reform (the elimination of the Chamber of Deputies' functions duplication by the Senate, which aimed to impart more of preciseness and mobility to the state mechanism). As demonstrated in the article, Renzi's coming to power initially gave rise to exaggerated expectations that were quickly replaced by disappointment as far as the reforms resulted barely in a limited youth unemployment decrease and were not able to lead the country out of the economic stagnation. M. Renzi's actions were constrained by the rigid framework of the EU budgetary policy. The referendum, necessary for the maintenance of a constitutional reform, turned into a voting in favor or against Renzi, and its negative result caused not only reversal of the reform, but also resignation of Renzi's government, and probably, breakdown of the reformatory line, the danger of populist forces' coming to power in one of the biggest European countries.

AB The author examins a series of articles by B. F. Lomov, director of the Institute of Psychology of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, which appeared in scientific and political journals in the period following the establishment of the institute. Given that Lomov was simultaneously acting in several roles, as a representative of the psychological community, as director of the institute, and as a head of a scientific school, the author adopts a hypothesis that the articles must have reflected interests bounded with each of these roles. To define those interests, the article describes the state of social sciences in the Soviet Union during the 1960s-70s. This situation predetermined sharp interest of social sciences to establish their scientific status and to achieve recognition of their research data as valid. In comparison with sociology, psychology possessed relatively higher degree of recognition both within scientific community and state bureaucracy.
   Lomov's articles are examined by means of discourse analysis and rhetorical analysis, which show that the main goals of theoretical discourse are the following: promotion of a conceptual scheme for establishing unified psychological science, but with peculiarities of each psychological discipline; approval of psychology's scientific status by connecting it to the system theory; demonstration of practical value of psychological research. The key aim was to establish a framework theory, which would allow the Institute of Psychology to pursue the task prescribed by its founding documents of coordinating psychological research in the rest Soviet research organizations. Lomov put forward systems psychology as such theory, and its promotion was somewhat hindered by activity theory that could also be recognized as a framework for Soviet psychology. During the 1970s and till the 1980s, Lomov's theoretical discourse evolves towards compromise, which allowed activity theory to keep its main role in general psychology, while systems psychology could be developed as a tool for unification of knowledge both within psychology and all social.

AB The study of any phenomenon of modern capitalist society must begin by addressing underlying substance of any society, any economic mode 1- to labor. The current stage of development of technological progress causes the need to appeal to classical philosophical and economic concepts and categories, as modern philosophical thought, which has experienced the influence of poststructuralism, can not provide a methodological and reflective apparatus on the one hand, and on the other hand, modern economic thought is becoming more and more politically biased and denies the tenets of classical political economy in favor of liberal capitalist values, which does not also contribute to the objective of obtaining genuine scientific knowledge. The theme of labor and its main types - concrete, abstract and universal, revealed by K. Marx in the "Capital", is not widely popular, neither in the philosophical nor in the economic literature, however, from a methodological point of view, the concepts and categories, derived by Marx with the help of the dialectical method, may have the required methodological, reflective and descriptive potential, so necessary in modern philosophy and economics. In this article the authors ' position on this issue is most summarized.

AB The Soviet Union's October 1957 launching of Sputnik was of domestic political importance to the US. It led to a review of the US education system, which resulted in the adoption of the National Defense Education Act by the US Congress in 1958. Its purpose was to strengthen the national defense by appropriating federal financial support to increase the number of educational programs responding to critical national needs. Discussion of Sputnik's influence on the reform of American education has continued for 60 years. In the scientific and journalistic literature various arguments have been advanced for and against satellite's influence, which are discussed in this article. It attempts to show the satellite's impact on accelerating negotiations for exchange agreements between the USSR and the USA in the fields of culture, technology and education, and ultimately creating a new branch of American historical scholarship - Russian Studies. Particular attention is paid to the content of Section VI of the NDEA. It provided financial support to higher education institutions that established or already had in place modern foreign languages centers. The results of the implementation of this paragraph were evident in the same year, as universities in different states began establishing Russian and East European Studies Centers. It became the starting point for a new stage in the development of Soviet-American relations in the field of science and education.

   disability mass media discourse; source (base) metaphoric model
AB In the study of contemporary political discourse there is a new, little-known, topical direction, which is the analysis of modelling the conceptual metaphor of an image of a person with disabilities. Disability issues, like gender, race and any other social equality issue, are of great importance. Human prejudice, stereotypes, ignorance hinder us from understanding the problems of the disabled who frequently suffer bad attitudes and exclusion. Mass Media have a great power to promote the positive image of a person with disability. Over time, attitudes towards people with disability have changed greatly from a stigma (when " criple" was considered as evil because of his/ her disability) to medical model (with scientific advances in medicine and other fields) in the 18th and 19th centuries, to a sociopolitical model in the mid-twentieth century, up to the present SOCIAL MODEL where a person with a disability is an active participant in all spheres of life. The authors are doing cognitive, contextual and discursive analyses of four types of metaphors: naturomorphic, antropomorphic, sociomorphic and artefact metaphors examining the articles of popular magazines and newspapers of Russia and the USA to compare and distinguish universal and peculiar national features in representation of disability mass media discourse of the two countries. The research is based on Lakoff's theory on cognitive metaphor, which is considered as the core of human thinking, and on works of Russian linguists (Baranov, Kubryakova, Karaulov and others). This article classifies the models according to their source-spheres and distinguishes the models which have necessary criteria for comparative analyses.

DT Article
DE parliamentarism; separation of powers; political representation;

AB The article is devoted to the analysis of two contradictory tendencies in the Duma of the last convocation documented by the author. The first is about change in the composition of the deputy corps, due to the addition of the majoritarian component as well as a number of other reasons - ranging from hopes for a low turnout to new prohibitions and restrictions in the legislation. The second tendency is related to change in the work style of the Lower House of the Federal Assembly. In addition to reducing its scandalousness and getting rid of a "crazy printer" reputation, the Duma's as well as individual parliamentary factions' leadership attempts to streamline and fully centralize the legislative process. While the first trend implies an increase in the deputies' political independence, the second trend assumes an even greater reduction in their influence on the decisions made by the Duma. After considering possible consequences of the development of these tendencies, A.Kynev concludes that if the Kremlin encounters new difficulties and the Russian authoritarian model starts eroding, the "sleeping potential" of the current Duma may wake up and then it will startle us.

AB A. Kynev analyzes the results of Duma elections in 1993-2016 to show that the Russian model of mandates' distribution within party lists leads to a significant distortion of regional representation in favor of the regions with the least competitive elections. Such model also stipulates the replacement of party competition with competition between regions and transforms elections into the battle of administrative resources, which encourages local governments to engage in election fraud. This results in even lower level of party competition as well as diminishes parties' influence in general. According to Kynev, only radical reform of electoral model can fix the status quo. Electoral system should guarantee that territories obtain an adequate representation in parliament in proportion to the number of voters in these territories.

AB In the face of the increasing complexity (multidimensionality) of the transforming Russian society and the emerging pluralism of socio-political interests, a growing need in civil society for strengthening the functional capacity of the institute for advocacy and promoting public interest in the public sphere was shown. The modality of this request is enhanced by the crisis conditions of economic development. With the dominance of administrative-bureaucratic approaches to public policy there is a falsification of feedback and a dysfunction of the public sphere in the direction of strengthening the influence of corporate and bureaucratic interests against the public interest, which inevitably leads to increased social tension and protest moods, as well as to a declining level of confidence in state activities and the legitimacy of political power. The subject of this research are successful practices in identifying and advocating the public interest. Among them: the administrative guillotine, associated with the reduction of terms for rendering state and municipal services to entrepreneurs in the Perm region; the preservation of the status and location of the Children's cancer hospital in St. Petersburg; protection of relict lake Harovoye in Kazan; defending the rights of citizens to common house property in Kostroma. The main questions arising while studying the above practices are: who and how articulates the public interest?; what is the role and influence of civil society institutions on regional policy formation?; And, how and in what way are concerned citizens becoming "actors" of public policy, etc? The case study approach was selected as a basic method for this project. The method of content analysis of available publications was applied in all of the selected cases. Descriptions of cases were made on a unified format. In-depth interviews and focus groups were used for clarifying details. It is shown that the development of institutions for public participation, and mechanisms for cross-sectoral social partnership contribute to streamlining interaction between authorities and society. In the conditions of incompleteness of processes for socio-political transformation these approaches also enhance the effectiveness of the social representation of public interests and stimulate the reform of public administration in the direction towards openness and transparency, that help to more adequately take into account the increasing mobility and pluralism of social groups and their socio-cultural preferences. This article summarizes the results of case studies in three Russian regions (Kostroma and Yaroslavl oblasts plus the Republic of Tatarstan). The main conclusion is that in improving the functional capacity of the institute for identification, formation and advocacy of public interests can be reached through enhancing the procedures for citizen engagement in decision making processes, and considering it as an important resource and the basis for improving the quality of modern governance and democracy.

DE history; revolution; socialist doctrine; social radicalism; terrorism;

AB The paper singles out and analyses the propositions of Chicherin's philosophy of history which show the scholar's understanding of the phenomenon of revolution and the socialist doctrine. Formulated and substantiated is the idea that revolution is interpreted philosophically as a negative means of the objectification of historical development, which violates the natural course of history, casting a society back, condemning it to a painful torment and irreplaceable sacrifice. This work expands understanding of revolution as the extremely dangerous manifestations of social radicals. It analyzes the criticism Checherin's basic theoretical propositions of socialist doctrine for which the idea of revolution was one of the main ideas. It shows, as the philosopher noted, the deformation by socialist theoreticians of the liberal-humanist principle of freedom of the individual and society, the distortion of the idea of independence of civil society from the state, the failure of the economic theory of socialism. The paper also emphasizes the version of the peculiarities of forming revolutionary forces and the major manifestation of social radicalism in Russia in the second half of the 19th century. These features are emphasized as being connected with motivating the necessity of social-political reforms to achieve social stability.The author gives proof of the point that Chicherin's ideas have universal constructive meaning to the extent that they accentuate criticism of revolution and socialism and the necessity of preventing revolutionary and radical sentiment and activity as an important condition for maintaining the integrity of the social system. This thinker's theoretical constructs are of undoubted benefit to the modern domestic philosophy of science, social and political practice. The article highlights aspects Chicherin's theory which determined his personal experience and ideological positions. Refs 13.

AB After the Russian Revolution, with civil war and interventions, war communism (1918-1921) led to a period of great economic difficulties in Russia. The New Economic Policy was the solution, and concessions offered to Western business interests were a part of it. In the timber industry of the 1920s, the jointly Western and Soviet controlled company Russnorvegoles was an important concession. The majority of the Western interests were Norwegian, and the company was registered as a Norwegian limited liability company with seat in Oslo. The four-and-a-half-year history, involving Western interests in the operations of Russnorvegoles, is both interesting and dramatic. Profitability was undermined, and intricate currency arrangements played a significant role during the last eighteen months in which Western interests were involved. The prominent Norwegian fascist politicians Quisling and Prytz were both involved, and the latter emerged a wealthy man. Living on his means for some years following 1928, he contributed financially to the formation in 1933 of a Norwegian Nazi party (Nasjonal Samling/National Reunion). This dimension of Norwegian political history demonstrates the role that Russnorvegoles played beyond the timber industry.

AB The article is devoted to the events that took place in October-November of 1741 which were connected with the attempts of a number of dignitaries to work out the legislative mechanism of accession within the ruling family in order to avoid a possible interregnum. The active participants of the discussions were Regent Anna Leopoldovna, cabinet ministers A. I. Osterman and M. G. Golovkin, the first member of the Synod Archbishop of Novgorod Ambrose, as well as a member of the Economy Collegium I. N. Temiriazev and the secretary of the Foreign Affairs Collegium A. Poznyakov. As a rule, in historiography these events are deal with the court intrigues. At the same time the surviving documents are of special interest as sources of the political culture of the XVIIIth century Russian nobility. The analysis of documents (opinions and drafts of persons which are published in this article) allows us to conclude that the positions and preferences of their authors can not be explained simply by court conjuncture. They sought to solve the problem within the framework of the actual legislation. The authors showed themselves as a supporters of the << legal monarchy >> but not voluntary decisions even if it was sanctified by the name of the sovereign. Also these events showed that representatives of the ignoble metropolitan nobility had a chance to express themselves and even to influence the creation of the fundamental law of the monarchy. Although the coming to the power of Elizabeth Petrovna did not allow this projects to be realized and their opinions hadn't significant impact on the history of the imperial legislation, these documents testify to certain successes in the development of secular political culture in post-Petrine Russia.

AB This article is a review of the textbook by A. I. Nikitin "International Conflicts: Interference, Peacemaking, Settlement", dedicated to international conflicts, as well as international activities for their resolution and resolution, in the context of modern peacekeeping practice. The structure of the textbook is composed of three separate blocks with an independent educational and methodological significance: the theory of international conflicts; peacemaking: the regulatory framework, forms and methods of organizing and conducting peacekeeping operations; cases, that is, analysis of specific international and regional conflicts, arranged by region. Synthesis of these three blocks and directions provides for the desired synergistic effect. The reviewed textbook will be quite useful for a wide readership, for it is written on a high system and professional level. This is a complete, well-established work, based on a solid source base, demonstrating the author's excellent knowledge of the methodology of political science research and a highly professional style of presenting knowledge. In addition, this is one of the first works on international conflictology, which will be in demand by everyone studying international relations and conflictology. The book fills a huge gap in the educational literature on conflictology. The level of conclusions and generalizations presented in the book corresponds to the advanced level of development of modern political science. Numerous facts, information and reference data accompanying the analysis of conflicts make the book interesting not only for students and graduate students, but also for those who already have experience with research and practical work in this field.

   the center-periphery model
AB By inertia, which derives from Adam Smith, modern capitalism is described as a free-market competition. This historical model has worked while the market expands and the availability of resources increases. It provided the opportunity to maintain the political order of the welfare state as a form of non-economic egalitarian distribution of resources, which mitigates inequality and class antagonisms generated by market. However, once capitalism has engulfed the whole world, it is more prone to crises: competition intensifies, markets of demand and market outlets do not expand, technological progress creates a growing structural unemployment, economic growth due to the completion of the global village-city transition stagnates, the resources of all the peripheries are almost exhausted. As a result, nationalism and protectionism arise, the polarization between the global center and the periphery increases, and there comes the image of undemocratic and non-egalitarian labor less society on the horizon of the future, with the precariat and the unemployed growing in numbers and demanding large amounts of rent to maintain their livelihoods. Due to this, the market model of capitalism is gradually transforming into a rental one, where the pursuit of profit, the main motivational factor intrinsic to the market, is removed by the pursuit of rent and the redistribution of markets by non-economic ways. In this context, the state becomes the key economic actor, which distributes resources by extra-market means within the hierarchy of rental groups that form the framework of a new structure of the political community.

AB The paper examines factors needed for science and technology convergence and tries to create new understanding and attitude to innovation with the help of modern educational tools in higher education institutes. The results of original research are described in this paper. The key task of the research was to elucidate students' technological literacy and to get their ideas about the development of future technologies. Elements of a new education paradigm aimed at forming a single integrated picture of the world are formulated. During the study, two issues have been found out: 1) young people have no ideas about advanced technologies; 2) they do not realize their personal responsibility for the future of technological safety. Thus, educational paradigm can be based on the following principles: 1) recognition of the unity of social and natural environments; 2) taking into account characteristics of society development with high natural, technological, social and political risks; 3) admission of personal responsibility for moving to resource-efficient and nature-like technologies; 4) admission of responsibility in forming graduates' social responsibility competence in their professional activities.

AB The article discusses the evolution of theories of social revolution from the mid-nineteenth to the late twentieth centuries. The author analyzes the basic concepts of theorists and practitioners of the armed revolutionary struggle - from the founder of the classical Communist theory of Karl Marx to the Mexican guerrilla leader Subcomandante Marcos. The author focuses on the analysis of changes in the understanding of the subject ("driving forces") of the left political revolution, as well as the strategy of armed revolutionary struggle.
   The author comes to the conclusion about the historical evolution of the subject of the revolutionary struggle from major sustainable macro-groups ("classes"), targeted at the armed struggle, to self-born ( by the network principle) unstructured protest groups, situational leaders, mild forms of the revolutionary struggle, which minimize the armed violence, though do not eliminate it completely. The author substantiates the conclusion about the absence in the modern protest movement of social forces, able to become the subject of revolution socialist orientation. This increases the danger of dominance of the social protest of extremist nationalist and religious political spectra.
   The author offers two models of response to this threat: the growing influence of the reigning centre-right conservative parties of Russia; return to center-left positions of the social democratic movement of the countries of the European Union.

ID INTERNATIONALIZING HIGHER-EDUCATION; GOVERNMENT POLICIES
AB According to many researchers one of the main challenges in higher education is the growing competition in the global education market. This article analyses the export of Russia's higher education from the standpoint of two theoretical approaches: the neoliberal one, in which the university attracts foreign students in order to make a profit, and the political economy approach, according to which the state competes with other states and gains political influence through education.
   By drawing on statistical and sociological survey data, the article shows that currently the export of Russian higher education is primarily pushed by the universities themselves with the purpose of making additional profits. The state provides a limited number of scholarships for foreign students that serve to improve political loyalty with the countries that form part of the CIS. Nevertheless, as the example of one of the leading Russian universities suggests, the active promotion of educational products abroad can push the attractiveness of Russian higher education in countries both within and beyond the CIS.

TI DE-COLONIZING POLITICAL BOUNDARIES IN CENTRAL ASIA
SO MGIMO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Central Asia; colonialism; Russia; Westphalia; decolonialism; Islam;
   Bukhara; Jadids; orientalism
AB The discourse of "borders" and decolonisation in the context of Central Asia has been a path unexplored until this moment, therefore a "startup" approach is logical. This "border" is a phenomenon that continuously shapes and transforms itself, therefore giving new light to the understanding of history and culture of Central Asia. This guiding principle influences the relationships that are built between close and distant neighbors on the planet. The other side opposite of this the notion is that of a modern state, that does not tolerate the lack of an identity; it requires one to cement a belonging to a certain geographical unit. The history of "modern and national" is articulated through the juxtaposition of "I" and "Other" ("outside of the border"). The interconnections of borders, states in Central Asia, and their orientalist platform do not lend themselves to an easy solution. The border does not hide or deny its artificiality, it has become ingrained as the norm. The innocent process of modern statebuilding is ensued by its ''Westphalian'' foundation. Naturally such interpretation of modern state raises more questions than answers. These questions are related to the uncertainty of the past of Central Asia, as well as the it's bordering lands. The most fascinating characteristic of such uncertainty, is that it displays multi-locality (or otherwise, multi-community) rather than "multi-nationality. Inside Dushanbe, Samarkand, Tashkent, and Bukhara most of these communities are distinguished by their national diversity, which is a given. This "rhythm" continues to make the region more open not just to each other internally, but also globally. Therefore, in this context the remaining colonial heritage should be treated differently, without constant references to "borders", without attempts to reproduce the sense of subordination of former colonization. In this regard, the proximity (geographical, cultural, "Soviet") to Russia should help with understanding its own Eurasian of interconnectedness. A real equilateral dialogue, with the incorporation of the accumulated common academic heritage. i.e. sovereignty (in which all the inhabitants of the republics are believed) cannot be represented as a voluntary application of the universally declared right to self-determination. All five members of the Central Asian "club" march and convince each other, that the abstract universal form of international relations in no way makes our common ''stan'' Eurocentric. While Central Asian involvement in so-called "national" cultures is difficult to materialize with its variety of languages, traditions, styles. Hence the difficulty of a sense of ''multinationality''.
   This should rather be treated and seen "multi-locality" (or otherwise "multi-community") in Dushanbe, Samarkand, Tashkent, Bukhara. National diversity of these communities are naturally inherent. This "rhythm" continues to make the region more open to each other and to the world, transforming it into a "field" located on beyond good, evil, right or wrong. The region is where the diversity meets.

AB The article is devoted to the sociolinguistic study "The language of a Red Army soldier. A study of the vocabulary of a Red Army soldier in Moscow", carried out by Soviet psychotechnologists under the guidance of Isaac Spielrein in 1924-1925. With multiple sources analyzed including the materials of the Russian State Military Archive, the article describes the conditions of organizing and conducting the study and publishing its results alongside the subsequent repression against the authors. It illustrates the conditions and causes of the initial rapid development of theoretical debate and research practice in the 1920s and their full curtailment in the early 1930s. The article reveals in a condensed manner the covert reasons for publication, provides additional information about the organizational and methodological aspects of the project, as well as about the causes of its years-long disappearance and its significance for modern research practice. The paper aims to revive the topicality of the problem of objective analyzing the evolution of sociological science in the Soviet Union in 1920-19305.

AB The article presents a detailed analysis of the online survey, aimed at defining the image of the ideal political figure in Russia, i.e. demands from the society and from the government, the specific characteristics of policies and criteria for success in politics, the possible obstacles to its achievement. The method of research is the expert survey of 174 professionals from public administration and policy, scientific and business communities. The experts were selected based on recommendations from other experts; all experts have at least 5 years' professional or academic experience in the field of research, have contributed to science and on constant basis take part in sessions and meetings held by the authorities. This article contains results of the analysis of social and psychological factors, which influence the formation process of the image of a politician. Further, we describe the characteristic features of political leaders, as well as analyze the experts' associative array on the term "political leader" and show the purposes of those who engage in politics. During the analysis, some interesting facts about the criteria of political success have been established. For instance, participants of the survey identified the stages of life, events and situations that affect political success. To conclude, there is a request for a strong and credible political leader in Russia, who is a professional, an effective manager (with the experience of making important management decisions and the correct prediction of socio-political situation). It is also notable that transparency was called one of the most important characteristics of an ideal politician's behavior.

DE democracy; democratization; democratic values; equal opportunity
   society; political institutions; meritocracy; political participation;
   civic engagement
AB The author applies to data of the monitoring sociological studies of the Institute of Sociology (Russian Academy of Sciences) in order to analyze the prospects for democratization of public and political life in Russia and to define presence / absence of the request for such democratization in public life. The author emphasizes that the prospects for democratic evolution of the Russian society is just one possible scenario among other variants of political transformation. This hypothesis is confirmed from one side by the emerging changes of public attitudes that are associated with actualization of the majority's orientation on stability, as well as with the lack of changes in economic and political life of the state. From the other side this hypothesis is confirmed by the fact of absence of any clear value and institutional attitudes in the mass consciousness of Russian citizens (whereas one can see the skepticism of many citizens about first attempts of democratization of the state that took place in 1990-ies). The author pays special attention to some specific features of the democracy's perception by Russian citizens that are in some cases different from its traditional doctrinal interpretations (it is, for example, the dominance of personalistic discourse over the institutional one) but does not consider that designing of any kind of special Russian model of democracy is possible and appropriate. The article also contains information about the factors that either contribute to democratization of social and political life or obstruct it. The author concludes that democratization of social and political life in Russia, alike the "democratic revolution of 1980-1990-ies" will be a process of changes, prolonged over time. Besides, as it is claimed in the text, this democratization process will be implemented under the pressure of civil society and will be focused on two main aims: firstly, on the formation of the mechanism of translation of diverse individual and group (primarily economic) interests into the language of universal problems, and, secondly, on the expansion of the space for implementation of such interests.

   Security Strategy; strategic outlook; strategic planning
AB The contemporary transformation and chaos in international relations reduce its predictability, which must be compensated by strengthening the normative content of its analysis that is in fact strategic planning. The deepening of international relations in recent years allows one to make a pessimistic conclusion about the most likely and dangerous scenario for the development of international relations - << the strengthening of military power struggles among the major local human civilizations >> and they represent a military-political coalitions and power centers. It should be noted that an effective tool for the implementation of this confrontation is the system of military and civilian instruments used to provide comprehensive multi-factor and multi-dimensional effect on an object. Today, the most striking example of such an integrated influence policy is the new public diplomacy. For implementation of such an integrated approach Russia needs to reform the system of national security to include in it not only the traditional enforcement agencies, but also the organizations of business and civil society, as well as to improve coordination between its individual parts. However, the implementation of such a reform is impossible without national ideology that forms the regulatory priorities of national development and national security.

TI "COUNTRY" AND "AUTONOMY" AS ACCOUNTING UNITS IN CONTEMPORARY WORLD
SO MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE country; sovereign state; autonomy; colonial and continental empire;
   territory with special status
AB The article examines the usage of the term "country" in describing and studying the forms of the modern world territorial organization. In ordinary discourse, this term is widely used for reference to a class of territorial units which are intuitively characterized by some kind of commonality. However, this commonality can be exposed and understood through some other terms and concepts. Juxtaposition of the terms "country", "state", and "autonomy" allows making the nature and the structure of the modern world territorial arrangement more clear. Also, it contributes to a conceptual discussion about "territories with special status". The term "state" specifies a political-institutional dimension of territorial formation, and the term "country" defines its cultural, including political-cultural dimension. Between these dimensions there are complex relationships of interdependence and repulsion. The terms "country" and "state" have both common attributes (territory and population), and specific ones ("power" - in relation to the "state" and "politicized cultural identity" - in relation to the country). The discrepancy between territorial boundaries of the "state" and the "country" may lead to the emergence of "autonomy" as a territorial entity. That is, "power" and "identity" conflict with each other in the territorial dimension. The emergence of the "country" as a political actor is a condition for realization of this possibility. It raises a question of the "country's" political and institutional status based on its "cultural" specifics.

DE February Revolution of 1917; workers; workers' movement; revolutionary
   crisis; Russia; World War I
AB This article considers the role of the workers' movement, mass sentiments, and behavioral practices of workers in the development and resolution of the revolutionary crisis on the eve of February, 1917 in the context of the modern historiographical situation. The author analyses the main factors and manifestations of the aggravation of workers' protest moods and protest activity between mid-1915 and early 1917. It is established that the most urbanised strata of workers, primarily the metalworkers of Petrograd played a major role in the development of the political strike movement. The worsening of the socio-economic situation and the growth of protest activity of the mass strata of workers correlated. The labour movement also depended on the crisis of the upper strata more than on the agitation of revolutionary parties. The author maintains that the workers' protest practices, which received an impulse in the autumn of 1916, were based on their idea of the need for a radical democratisation of the political system, the abolition of the autocratic regime, which became widespread in the working environment. While it was not the workers that played a decisive role in overthrowing autocracy in February 1917, the author cautions against the underestimation of the role of workers as one of the main social actors of the Revolution. The soil for the overthrow of autocracy ripened in the mass sentiments of workers, their spontaneous movement, which the left parties rested on. Without the high activity of workers, the February events would not have become a popular movement.

TI REVOLUTIONS AND RELIGIONS: EXPERIENCE IN COMPARATIVE MORPHOLOGY
SO MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
LA Russian
DT Editorial Material
DE revolution; religion; prophecy; charismatic situation; comparative
   morphology; globalization; postsecular epoch
AB The notions of Revolution and Religion are understood as designations of two different basic human projects piercing the whole history of the last half-millennium from the very period of Reformation up to now. It may seem, these two projects have some kind of opposite directions: Revolution is directed towards short-term social and political changes, while Religion is directed towards far-reaching transcendent values and notions. But, actually, both these phenomena (Revolution and Religion) continually provoke one another in a long and complex historical and social interplay, sometimes in very unusual and paradoxical situations. Moreover, it is difficult to understand the entire complex of the present-day regional as well as global social and political shifts without taking this interplay into account. This paper, partly appealing to the theoretical heritage of Giambattista Vico, leans on the Weberian framework of historical morphology of great socio-cultural movements, partly refined by Samuel Eisenstadt: collective frustration - protest - charismatic animation - institutional adaptation to real historical, social and cultural milieu - bureaucratic institutionalization and routinization - gradual enfeeblement. However, one of "surprises" sprung in the 20th and 21st century may be the trend of inner renovation and interplay of old, seemingly obsolete great historical movements, including those of religious search and revolutionary protest. All these renovation processes could partly explain many features of political dynamics in the present-day world. Thus, the "Second Coming" of movements and ideas sometimes perceived as ideologically and politically exhausted and obsolete is one of the striking marks of the present "post-modern" and "post-secular" epoch.

AB The paper discusses present-day feelings about 1917 revolutions and their significance as guides for public and media people, approaches to 1917 by contemporary Russian publics, politicians and political analysts as well as a phenomenon of today expectations in Russia. Recent revolutionary outbursts are shown as a trend of global developments in late XX-early XXI-st century. Writings both by Russian historians and sociologists of revolutions on 1917 are briefly reviewed. Impact of these revolutions on the history of Russia is stressed as well as that of civil war to play a role of lasting century-long trauma throwing its shadow over the whole of Russia's XX century history and beyond. An outstanding place of P.Sorokin's "Sociology of revolutions" is emphasized for the present-day thinking on revolutionary chances for the country. 1917 heritage is discussed in the light of Russian ideas which drove a significan part of country's population towards socialist dreams in 1917 and ensuing struggles. This is arguably a chapter far from being closed for present-day Russia.

DT Article
DE Conservationist Movement; Green Movement; environmental NGOs; local
   environmental groups; Green Party U.S.; elections; Green New Deal
AB The article thoroughly analyses the history of the American Environmentalism as a socio-political movement and follows the evolvement of the early elitist Conservationist Movement into a mass Green Movement based on public participation. The importance of Conservationist principles in the U.S. state policy greatly increased during the first half of the 20th century, especially during the Progressive Era under the first President-conservationist Theodore Roosevelt (1901-1909). The economic revival after the Great Depression of 1929-1933 included development of environmental and tourist infrastructure with mass participation of the civil society. However, the contemporary U.S. Green Movement was formed during and right after the World War II, as a natural consequence of the smart policy pursued by the President Franklin Delano Roosevelt as part of his "New Deal" course. By 1970-1980s, it already included three directions: the traditional Wilderness Preservation, the Anti-Nuclear Movement and a combination Anti-Toxic Movement/Environmental-Justice Movement (known as NYMBY). Special attention is paid to its basic forms - the environmental non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and Green political parties. It is concluded that the variety of environmental NGOs - older and newer, national and local, information- and agitation-oriented, advocacy practicing and political lobbyists, etc. - are grassroots of the environmental movement in the U.S., mobilizing civil support and creating an electoral base for Green political parties both at the state and federal level. The author investigates their present condition and perspectives, strategy and tactics of their social and political activities. At present, the popularity of "green ideas" in the American society is still inadequate for the Green Party U.S. to provide a real competition with the two main political parties - Democratic and Republican - at the federal level, even in view of its social-democratic orientation. However, "The Greens" are successful at the local level. Popularization of "green ideas", mobilization of followers among the civil society, environmental legislation lobbying and strengthening of the environmental justice system currently remain the main tactics of American environmental organizations.

DE Spiritual and moral culture; a student; the student youth (students);
   value orientations of the student youth; basic national values;
   spiritual values of the national culture; spiritual experience of the
   individual; spiritual and moral culture of the student
AB The spiritual formation of a modern person occurs in conditions of socioeconomic transformations characterized by the devaluation of traditional values of the national culture, the aggressiveness of the information environment that actively imposes ideals and hedonistic attitudes that are not typical of the Russian mentality, the emergence of new requirements for the individual, which are not always correlated with morality. "Moral absolutes" as the spiritual core of the personality often undergo deformation, and the need to support the younger generation in correcting the vector of their spiritual development becomes more and more obvious. The development and improvement of the experience of the spiritual being and spiritual maturation of the young person is especially important in the student years - in the period of professional and personal formation, when young people are ready to accumulate human experience of being and master the world in the form of knowledge, values and meanings (M. Bakhtin) by interiorizing the values of the spiritual culture of mankind and increasing "good in the world around us" (D. Likhachev) in the process of their exteriorization. The dominant role of students' life is the comprehension of life and the world order in the process of acquiring knowledge and preparing oneself for future intellectual, productive or cultural activities. Being a highly educated and highly cultured part of society, students act as an innovative reserve and potential elite of society as a whole, which accumulates in its ideas the opportunities and resources of future political, cultural and economic transformations in society.
   The problem of formation of spiritual and moral culture of students is actualized as socially significant in the context of the analysis of the basic documents in the field of education. In the Federal Law "On Education in the Russian Federation" (2012), "Strategies for the development of upbringing in the Russian Federation for the period until 2025", the target program "Development of the Education System of Orenburg Region" until 2020, the priority tasks are the formation of a harmonious personality combining national ethnic identity, respect for the culture and traditions of people living side by side; prevention of ethnic and religious and political extremism in the youth environment.
   However, in real learning process in institutions of secondary vocational and higher education there is insufficient attention paid to the formation of students' spiritual and moral culture. Comparative analysis of our own research of 210 students of colleges and universities of Kazan and Orenburg regions and the data of the Institute of Sociology of the Academy of Sciences (Moscow) showed an objective situation of spiritual distress among young people: students are not fully included in the process of conscious spiritual maturation, experience in solving meaningful life problems is acquired spontaneously by them, only 12% of the respondents feel the need to experience spiritual states and make spiritual efforts, 36% of the respondents understand the need to exercise in society such personal qualities as justice, compassion, tolerance towards representatives of different nationalities, religions and views.
   Formation of the spiritual and moral culture of the student youth can be carried out both in educational and extra-curricular activities. In educational and cognitive activities the formation of the spiritual and moral culture is carried out in the process of comprehension of spiritual and moral content of the subjects - acquaintance with biographies of scientists with an emphasis on their personal characteristics, understanding achievements of this branch of science for the development of mankind as a whole and preserving humanity in it, 'embedding' new knowledge into their scientific picture of the world on the basis of understanding of its spiritual meanings. During extra-curricular activities, students' spiritual and moral culture is enriched both in the forms of organized activities (events) and self-organization (clubs, voluntary work, quests), which gives them an opportunity to acquire skills in spiritual and moral life ("by doing charity, mutual assistance, compassion, patriotic creation of our Fatherland", hegumen Cyprian).
   The role of educational environment of the university in the formation of spiritual culture of students as a factor of "bringing to the space of their 'I' that increases its value" (V. Ignatova) has not been fully studied yet. In this regard, the problem of identifying optimal conditions that minimize negative impact of environmental and cultural factors on the process of spiritual maturation is important.

AB The article is devoted to the study of the experience of regulation of interethnic relations through educational policy. Such an approach seems very productive, taking into account the diversity and importance of functions performed by education. As an object of study, a policy in the field of education in the European Union was chosen, with focus on one aspect of this policy - language teaching. The authors consider the legal framework for the regulation of ethnopolitical relations within the educational policy, noting that the legislation was formed under the influence of the existing legal conflict, between the principle of self-determination and the principle of territorial integrity of state. The study analyzed the peculiarities of the legislation governing the teaching of the language, examined some interesting examples of law enforcement practices in countries such as France, Italy, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Spain. In these countries, according to the authors, national features of the implementation of the policy of regulation of ethnopolitical relations in the field of language education are clearly manifested. The article concludes that within the framework of supranational structures of the EU, mechanisms for regulating interethnic relations through policy instruments in the sphere of education are poorly developed. The main level of regulation remains the level of individual states. The "case studies" examined in the article allowed the authors to identify "indicative" cases, classify them, identify fundamentally different approaches to formulating a policy towards ethnic minorities in the field of education. This is a very "long-playing" choice, which, as a rule, does not depend on the layout of political forces within the country. It can be stated that in European countries in the field of education, two main strategies for the regulation of the rights of ethnic minorities are implemented: a policy of positive discrimination and an integrative policy. The analysis shows that the policy of positive discrimination of ethnic minorities, realized with some or other national peculiarities, was the most widespread in the EU countries in the field of educational policy. Particular attention is paid to the analysis of positive and negative aspects of applied practices. The authors emphasize the role of educational policy in the nation-building process. At the same time, they conclude that educational policy cannot be considered separately from the socio-economic and political context in which it is implemented. It is also not an independent mechanism for regulating interethnic relations, but rather an instrument for smoothing out ethno-cultural contradictions in the composition of the state's social, economic, and national policies.

SO HORIZON-FENOMENOLOGICHESKIE ISSLEDOVANIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Historicity; dehistorization; phenomenology; Marxism; Heidegger;
   Marcuse; space
AB The article aims to explain the connection of Marcuse's concept of dehistorization with his interpretation and criticism of the Heideggerian concept of historicity. Dehistorization in Marcuse's philosophy, according to my tentative definition, is the kind of transformation of the creative social forces and human abilities denying an existing reality that makes them elements of the mechanism producing and reproducing the existent reality, and thereby makes them a manner of repression of the human striving for freedom and happiness and a way to perpetuate domination. According to Marcuse, dehistorization is the main form of reproduction of the false totality. The idea of dehistorization is the prevailing critical concept in Marcuse's philosophy. It appears in the course of his criticism of fascism. The basis of the formation of the dehistorization concept is Marcuse's criticism and interpretation of Heidegger's conception of historicity during his "Heideggerian Marxism" period (1928-1933). This Heideggerian conception is the ultimate achievement of contemporary philosophy. The ultimate character of this achievement is given to it, according to Marcuse, that it treats history from the viewpoint of being in contrast to Hegel's idealistic dialectics and German historicism of the 19th century, which interpreted it from the viewpoint of consciousness or the spirit. There are four main tendencies in Marcuse's criticism and transformation of Heidegger's conception of historicity. 1. The deformalization of Heidegger's treatment of historicity of Dasein. The explanation of the material substance of historicity, i.e. the explanation of the material character of conditions of human existence (Dasein) as the definitive feature of historicity. 2. The concretization of Dasein, its treatment not as an individual, but as a class in view of substantial differences of the environment (Umwelt), material conditions of its existence. 3. Following from both the deformalization of historicity and the concretization of Dasein - the rehabilitation of the "being-with" (Mitsein) and the public sphere (Mitwelt), and, thereby, of the space of political struggle as the sphere of authenticity. 4. The disclosure of the fundamental role of the phenomenologically considered spatiality (Raumlichkeit) in the constitution of concrete historicity, i.e. historicity determined by the material, social and political character of Dasein and the world. Marcuse's interpretation and criticism of Heidegger's conception of historicity and his criticism of dehistorization based on it paves the way to his ontological interpretation of Marxist dialectics as the method of the struggle against dehistorization and false totality and as the only truly revolutionary way of thinking.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE Golden Horde; Egypt; Sultan Baybars; Berke Khan; Arab sources
AB Objective: To consider the personality of the Mamluk Sultan Baybars and his role in developing relations with the Golden Horde.
   Research materials: The medieval Arabic chronicles of Sultan Baybars' first biographers, Abd al-Zahir and Ibn Shaddad, as well as the information of later authors - Rukn al-Din Baybars, al-Maqrizi, al-Nuwayri, al-Ayni, and others.
   Results and novelty of the research: It is known that close relations with Berke Khan of the Golden Horde were developed during the reign of Sultan Baybars. The purpose of this alliance was the desire to neutralize the role of the Hulaguid state in the international arena. The fact that Baybars was of Kipchak origin was an important contributor to friendly relations. Despite the different information of medieval Arab authors regarding which original clan Baybars belonged to, we can quite definitely say that Baybars originated from the Barli tribe, based on the information of his main biographer Abd al-Zahir. The person of Baybars left its mark not only in the history of Mamluk Egypt, but also in the global historical context of the Muslim world. Both the promotion of their political interests and the preservation of cultural identity played an important role in the interrelations of Baybars with Berke Khan of the Golden Horde.

AB The article highlights the issues of interlinguistic translation (from one language into another), its possibilities and limits in the context of discrepancies between linguistic models of various nations, substantiates relations between translation and interpretation genetically close to hermeneutics of the meaning and construction of interconnection between the sign and the object through the successive sign in semiosis. The article also depicts correlation between semantic and grammatical interpretation in the course of verbal communication. In addition to the problem of untranslatability within the framework of interlinguistic translation the authors also focus on the analysis of discordance in intralinguistic translation (i.e. cross-cultural dissonance) in terms of sociology; the authors consider the phenomenon of association/dissociation of social meanings expressed in terms of language. Non-equivalence of political structures and social mechanisms of two types of society has been established, serving as a reason of contemporary discordance between Russia and the Western world.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE health monitoring; newborn; living conditions; factors
AB The paper presents the findings of the latest stage of a prospective medical-and-sociological monitoring of cohorts of families; its goal is to trace the development of child health. The monitoring is carried out in the Vologda Oblast by the Institute of Sodo-Economic Development of Territories of the Russian Academy of Sciences since 1995 and receives support from the Department of Health Care of the Vologda Oblast. The monitoring shows real-time dynamics of children's health and development and reflects the dependence of these changes on the factors that influence them. Specific examples show how factors such as parents' lifestyle, the environment in which children are brought up, financial welfare, medical and other health-related activities, diet and nutrition, housing and environmental conditions influence children's health.
   Over the past 20 years, the Russian Federation has undergone fundamental changes that affected the most important aspects of social life: Russia's political and economic structure changed; the country experienced two socio-economic crises and implemented intensive reforms in the key sectors (education, health care, housing-and-utilities sector, and agriculture). Changes in the economy have had a significant impact on public health and on children's health in the first place. On the basis of these studies, the authors show positive trends in the reforms of the economy in general and the social sphere in particular; these trends are reflected in the living conditions of families with children, in the level of health satisfaction, in the state of health of newborns, and in obstetric care statistics. The paper presents major factors contributing to the presence of functional abnormalities in the health of newborns (quality of living conditions in families, income level, health status of the mother, maternal smoking).

DE lexicography; ideographic description; social laxis; social semes;

AB The problem of description of nominative sets in dictionary of social vocabulary of ideographic type is discussed. The purpose of creation of such dictionary is seen in the development of a comprehensive description of the words, calling the facts, objects, relations, interactions from the social sphere. The author reports that for this purpose linguistic units are extracted from the dictionaries of literary language, slang and dialects in different historical periods. It is indicated that the value of forming ideography is in the search and description of linguistic facts, not yet committed to existing dictionaries. The new material is taken primarily from newspaper journalism, which refers to important social and political issues. The rules for the selection of social categories on the basis of the analysis of assertive and presuppositional zones of word meaning are described. The methods of compiling dictionary entries and including illustrative material is explained. It is shown that the analysis of contexts identifies the examples of actualization of shades of meaning, connotations, optional semes, marking the belonging to the category of social vocabulary. In other cases, "social" forms nuclear part in the structure of language unit meaning. A fragment of the nominations of ideograph "mass action against the official authorities," including linguistic facts from different time periods and linguistic idioms.

AB The outlook on integration processes in Europe prevalent in the Soviet-Russian official doctrine, academic literature and political journalism has been changing substantially: from ideologically prescribed perceptions through careful adaptation to reality - to multidisciplinary research on actual processes, considerably contributed by the scientists of IMEMO and other Russian research institutes. However, the exacerbation of relations with the West brings some authors back to politically charged presentment of processes in Europe. The European integration has traveled a long and complicated way from a multisectoral cartel agreement to the European Union (EU), a kind of a national states confederation, and from the six countries' association - to the conglomerate of 28 states embracing almost all of Europe west of the former USSR borders (and stepping outside of them in Baltics). Territorial expansion has boosted the Union's heterogeneity and put it to the challenging tasks of setting and realization of a conjoint line in world politics, negotiating counter-integration outbursts. In its path, the EU has faced significant successes and throwbacks. The association, at first economic, has spilled over to politics and the law, having arrived at common defense and security policy shaping. Human rights and fundamental freedoms - the core values of the European civilization which have become its historical contribution to the world development - are recorded as rightful principles of the EU. By overcoming conservative attitudes of the national sovereignty devotees, the level of regulation has been raising from intergovernmental to supranational. The failure of the European Constitution project in referendums in France and Holland (the Netherlands) was partly countervailed by conclusion of the Lisbon Treaty in 2009 which authorized the EU for its own legal personality and renewed its institutional structure. At the present stage, the aggravation of global problems, internal and external contradictions, the emergence of new challenges and threats has set the EU ambitious tasks with no clear solutions. All this promises Europe a tortuous future. However, its crowning achievements are irreversible, and the integration process which has been dominating over half a century will hardly be halted or redirected.

AB Loyalty of elites is widely acknowledged to be the prerequisite for maintenance of autocratic regimes. However, loyalty of which elites is more important to establish high voting for an autocrat and a high turnout? As elections in electoral autocracies are designed to demonstrate superiority of the autocrat over his rivals, Russian subnational elections serve to legitimatize the leadership of a pre-decided race favorite rather than establish fair competition. Even given that there is no intrigue in the election outcome, do conflicts still influence the result of voting? And which conflicts prove to be the most influential on the elections result? Basing on empirical evidence of gubernatorial election in Russia we explore how conflicts between the governor and the elites at municipal and regional levels affect incumbents' elections results. We collected electoral data for 43 regions and 1402 municipalities and coded qualitative data on conflicts between governor and elites. We find that conflicts between governors and the mayors of regional capitals have the only robust negative effect on both electoral result and turnout. In the regions with this conflict, governors receive up to about 16 percentage points lower support and 15 percentage point lower turnout. The explanation to the finding bases on the logic of mobilization machinery performance. Encouraging loyalty of these mayors secures smoother political machinery in the most electorally significant areas of the region (regional capitals) and thus has the most pronounced impact on the outcome of an electoral campaign. This finding provides another confirmation of the paramount role of covert rather than open inter-elite competition for electoral autocracies maintenance.

AB The current paper deals with the influence of metaphorical framing of events on public opinion from various scholarly perspectives. Treating cultural narratives employed in public discourse as an extended metaphorical frame, the paper argues that narratives make use of archetypical plots and the shared cognitive structures of human beliefs, motivations, goals, actions, events. Being systematically exposed to certain metaphorically framed narratives, people tend to change their views of events, situations and decisions affecting their lives.

AB The rapid development of modern information technologies is the main trend of world development in recent years. A key role in this process belongs to the Internet, which has evolved from the process of information exchange in particular communicative space. This communicative space is widely used not only by ordinary users of the Internet, but also the various political actors. The number of Internet users is rapidly grown in Russia. Along with this diversity of Russia's political citizen's participation in the Internet space is increased. Using the Internet, a person receives, distributes and provides information as well as creates the community "of interest". New communicative space is built with the help of IT-technology, with its channels and transmitters, with its own characteristics and problems. Network organizations based on the Internet began widespread in social and political life. Crowdsourcing and crowdfunding rapidly developing in Russia. As a result, the Internet has become not only a tool for social and political activity, but also autonomous environment for this activity. Social and political campaign organized only on the Internet becoming more common. The paper includes not only the analysis of contemporary Russian Internet reality, but also the results of the author's study of Internet activism in Russia by polling experts (conducted in 2015).

DE media; agency; social network; individuation
AB In this paper, the author brings into consideration certain modes of functioning of the networks, as well as their technological, social, political and biological aspects. Now that the integrated view of networks as a combination of biological, technological and social principles has become widespread, and the idea that networks are universally operable both on the level of biotechnology and that of social politics is prevalent, there emerges the problem of the elements of a network which are identifiable despite it still being widely recognized in the literature of the subject that network dataflow can neither be controlled nor decomposed. Combining Bruno Latour's vision of a network as claiming to uniformly include both human and non-human quasi-objects, constructed to explain processes of translation and substitution, with the conclusions about the elementary constituents of networks found in the works of technologically oriented media theorists, the present author argues that a more exact description of a network demands an analysis of the topological points where different subject areas intersect.

ID NORMATIVE POWER
AB Methods of research, informed by theories of international relations, frequently employed when studying foreign policy and global role of the European Union, are analytically discussed in this article for the sake of methodologic reflection. Such key concepts as statehood, subjectivity, system, identity, norms and differentiation, are used as reference points to "navigate" between separate theories in order to compare them, thus achieving a clearer description of conceptual ambiguity of respective terms, with certain consequences as concerns direction, limits and scope of any theoretically-oriented analysis. The article shows that IR theories are actively developing and provide good assistance to researchers in exploring international behavior and possible results of the EU's global influence. The choice the author makes in favour of a certain methodology cannot be taken as neutral: it influences the ways they are interpreted. Thus, better self-reflection is important for credibility of the findings. Ambivalence of the EU as an object of political study is a particular challenge for the IR theories, pushing on their evolution and consolidation of the analytical methods they use. The article presents additional options, provided in this respect by introducing methods employed in political economy and sociology. The notion of the normative power of Europe, introduced and developed by Ian Manners, is singled out as the most popular concept in the area of study under consideration, attracting in impressive numbers the attention of European specialists with differing theoretical predilections. It was found that, when basing exclusively on the constructivist theory as proposed by Alexander Wendt, this notion loses robustness as an instrument of research: rather than helping to understand the specifics of the EU's international behavior, it prescribes to the EU a certain quite aggressive conduct on the presumption of the indisputable superiority of the European norms for the future European and wider (global) order.

AB The participation of the cavalry from the Kalmyk Khanate in crushing the Don Cossacks's uprising led by ataman Kondrat Bulavin in 1707-1708 is a familiar historical fact, however, it is not sufficiently studied. The unique archival data discovered by the author helped him present an original detailed depiction of the Kalmyks's role in defeating Bulavin's rebellion. As the author analyzed the military aspect of the events, he also commented on the political motivation which drove the Kalmyk rulers to render assistance to Russian Tsar Peter I. The author focuses on the analysis of conflicts between the Kalmyk Khanate and the Don Cossack Host arising on the eve of Bulavin's rebellion. These conflicts drove the close neighbours apart in Russia's southern provinces and predetermined the coming events. The Volga and the Don Kalmyks were extremely opposed to the Don Cossacks' revolt against Peter I and his government. In fact, their negative attitude was what was typical of the Kalmyks' rulers who aimed at strengthening the relations with the Moscow government. Without hesitation they took the side of Tsar Peter I and assisted the Russian authorities in punitive operations against the Don rebels. The article describes how the Kalmyk cavalry detachments acted to defeat Bulavin's cohorts near Saratov, Tsaritsyn and on the Don. The author concludes that the successful operations of the Kalmyk cavalry against the rebels near Saratov prevented Bulavin from instigating the population of the Mid Volga region to fight against the government of Peter I and to unite with the insurgent Bashkirs near Ufa.

The methodological principles used in this study are based on the analysis of intellectual history (R. Rorty) and the phenomenon of the "organic intelligentsia" (A. Gramsci). The intelligentsia today turns out to increase the tendency to transforming the information which it owns into the form of property, which represents the function of an agent of spiritual production in a new way and demonstrates its direct relation to the political and economic spheres of society.

AB The article is devoted to the study of various aspects of military captivity, which became a mass phenomenon ("mass experience") in the years of the First World War and the revolutionary events in Russia and which influenced both the individual fate of war prisoners and different sides of the development of society. The article presents data on the number of war prisoners located in the years of war and revolution on the territory of the Astrakhan province, their categories and ethnic composition. The majority of war prisoners were soldiers of the German, Austro-Hungarian armies. The largest number of war prisoners on the territory of the province was recorded in May 1918. On the basis of documentary material, most of which is first introduced in the scientific use, the war prisoners' accommodation, provision of clothing, food, medical care is researched. The placement of the contingent of war prisoners and their number depended on the needs of the region in labour force. War prisoners were sent to work on the municipal facilities in the provincial center and district towns, were attached to joint-stock and private enterprises, worked as doctors and paramedics in hospitals.
   The situation of war prisoners fully depended on socio-economic and political situation in the country. The problems of supply of war prisoners with clothing and food aggravated with the economic and political crisis in the country as well as rising prices and were common to all categories of population who needed support. The deterioration of living conditions led to increase in diseases, epidemics and deaths among the prisoners. Local authorities made efforts to supply war prisoners with food and provide with higher wages and hospitals. After the events of February 1917 there were hopes for mitigation of the regime of war prisoners, but visible improvement did not follow and the weakening supervision of war prisoners resulted in the growth of prison breaks.

DT Article
DE A.D. Bogaturov; international relations theory; Russian school;
   Enlightened Statism
AB The recently published collection of papers by Aleksei Demosfenovich Bogaturov is an excellent opportunity to reflect on his contribution to the theory of international relations and its future in Russia. Bogaturov introduced, polished, and popularized a number of important ideas and concepts such as the "paradigm of adjustment," the "pluralistic unipolarity," the "enclave-conglomerate" structure of the world, the "strategy of grindering" of in world politics, and others. Russian IR scholars know and exploit these concepts in theoretical and applied research. There have been three influential traditions or ways thinking about the world in Russian science of international relations. Their representative value experiences of the West (Westernizers), independent statehood (Statists), and distinct system of cultural values (Third Rome), respectively. Each tradition of school of thought possesses its own images of Russia and international system that, historical changes notwithstanding, has preserved its internal coherence, continuity, and difference from other schools. Unlike Western realists, who assumed the centrality of the West in the international system, Russian enlightened statists take Russia's internal development seriously. They seek to combine the ideals of strong, independent state with those of human rights learning from others. In the post-Soviet period of Russian international relations theory (RIRT) the school of Enlightened Statism was best represented by the work of A. Bogaturov and his students. Following M. Khrustalev, Bogaturov sees the main tasks of RIRT in synthesizing theory and applied analysis of international relations. In terms of applied analysis, the main challenge for RIRT after the Soviet dissolution has been to understand the new system of international relations and Russia's role in it. In this respect, it is important to study political, military, normative-institutional, as well as geo-economic dimensions of the problem. The important theoretical conclusion is the need to develop Russian school of international relations while preserving flexibility and active dialogue with the West. Russia's academic experience teaches us to not be limited to schools and paradigms, but instead develop approaches and concepts grounded in empirical realities. This is hard to follow model that should serve as an important goal in further RIRT development.

DT Article
DE archival heritage of Semyon Frank; Russian philosophy in emigration;
   Russian revolution; Pugachev; Marx; Lenin
AB In this publication, we present (in a Russian translation from German) the transcript of Semyon Frank's lecture notes entitled Marx und Pugachev (orig. Marx und Pugatschow), stored in the Bakhmeteff Archive in New York, USA. The lecture was delivered by Frank on 15 November 1927 at the Russian Scientific Institute in Berlin. The essay which serves an introduction to this publication defines the place which belongs to this manuscript text among the works on social and political philosophy Frank completed in 1920s, in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution of 1917. It can be shown that throughout his entire output of this period, including the notes on Marx and Pugachev, Frank attaches to such names as Marx, Pugachev and Lenin a symbolic meaning. While even before this lecture Frank did use the word Pugachevshchina ('Pugachevism') as a general name for the particularly atrocious, blindfold kind of uprising common in Russian history, here Pugachev himself becomes a symbolic name for peasants and soldiers (Cossacks) who participate in the revolutionary movement and in whom Frank recognizes the 'mediating force' of the revolution. On the other hand, Pugachev remains for Frank a historical figure who in late 18th century already became an embodiment of many significant aspects of the Russian revolutionary type. A similar symbolic quality Frank also conveys to the figure of Lenin who is regarded by him as an 'amalgamation of Marx and Pugachev'. The introductory essay examines the possible reasons why from mid-1920s onward the reflections on revolution gain Semyon Frank's German-language writings an increasing weight.

AB The concept of property is basic for several human sciences: economy, law, but for the history the most substantial seems the philosophic and anthropological approach taking into consideration mental, spiritual and interpersonal aspects. Property as a relation of ownership or possession is associated to the idea of freedom and its limitations. The possibility to dispose of objects of property are being realized in time and space; spatial potentialities are larger, the time is but irreversible, therefore property as physical relation is associated rather with the space. The disposal of time belongs to power, because the power is being put into effect in taking decisions, in determining the coming future. Historically property is the basis of identity (the right on oneself and on one's own; all the societies were confronted with the task to protect, on one hand, and to limit, on the other hand, the property. In the Modern time the comprehension of sacrality of property as the pledge of democracy developed, the history is considered as an evolution from slavery to freedom. But natural boundaries of property, before all in the time, make its phenomenon quite unstable and changeable. Material property is rarely maintained within one family during several generations. In the Middle Ages the idea of antiquity as substantiation of ownership of land served for the protection of property. In that period personal rights to own a territory were not separated from political rights to rule subjects, from this, for example, the difficulty to translate such term as Latin "status", Italian "stato", i.e. possession, later "the state". political belonging (citizenship) is the specular social characteristics of the property. The idea of property of a territory extends also to the history of peoples and is realized through pretensions of states. The contradiction between physical, natural instability and the necessity of fixing the rights generated the attribution to the property of sacral status. In archaic societies the offence to the property of clan was punished with the death, superior owners were cods and spirits. The denial of property in Christianity expressed its transitory character; it determined also the contradiction between private property of a person or a family and collective property of people, society, and state. The property even in its immaterial forms ("intellectual property") is bound with material side of life; from here are elements of its negation in different religious and communist doctrines. But mechanisms of property redistribution are necessary for every society.

TI THE ROLE OF THE "GRAND SCHOOLS" AND THE "GRAND CORPS" AS RECRUITMENT
   CHANNELS FOR FRENCH MINISTERS
SO MGIMO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS

DT Article
DE France; ministers; recruitment channels; "grand schools"; "grand corps";
   high-ranking civil servants; professional
AB The recruitment of ministers among high-ranking officials, who studied in the "grand schools" and worked in the "grand corps", is one of the typical traits of the Fifth republic. This is a consequence of the traditional interpenetration of French administrative and political elites. However, there is no common view on the actual role of these institutions in the ministers' recruitment. So, the objective of this paper is to clarify this issue. For this purpose we analyze career trajectories of French ministers from 1981 till 2016. The data on each government include shares of ministers, who passed through the "grand schools" and the "grand corps".
   The article shows that nowadays the number of ministers with such an experience has decreased. Most government members are professional politicians, who have significant electoral experience and occupy high-ranking party positions. Today there are political parties, not the "grand schools" and the "grand corps", that are the main channels of the ministers' recruitment.
   The professionalization of politics and reinforcement of the role of parties in the French political system are the most crucial factors of this tendency. The transformation of gaullists into liberals and conduction of the liberal economic policy, instead of the dirigist one, also contributed to replacement of officials by representatives of the private sector.
   Despite the fact that political parties serve as a main channel of the ministers' recruitment, they face internal problems. The future role of political parties in the recruitment will depend on their ability to deal with these challenges.

DT Article
DE Arendt; Socrates; Plato; politics; thinking; action; dialogue
AB My paper provides a critical analysis of the epistemic, moral, social, and political implications of Arendt's view of the Socratic method. In both her earlier (1954) and later (1974) lectures on Socrates, Arendt depicts him as a thinker who overcomes the gap between the contemplative life of a philosopher and the life of an active citizen. Arendt contrasts the Socratic dialog of equal opinions which takes place between friends with the Platonic monologue of a teacher delivering the truth to his students. Despite some significant flaws in her opposition of Socrates and Plato, her view proves to be a useful leitmotif connecting her lectures with several of her main works, those of "The Human Condition", "On Revolution", and "Eichmann in Jerusalem." Arendt uses her picture of Socrates as a supporting argument in her analysis of the public role of opinion, of the distinctive traits of the inner dialog, and of the connection between thinking and action. Although Arendt does not give a direct answer to the question of the usefulness of Socrates' actions for Athens and remains sceptical regarding the possibility of philosophical thinkers to influence the social life, she provides valid arguments in favor of the necessity of the Socratic method in the case of a crisis of collective values. Her conclusions allow us to use her interpretation in modern debates on conservatism, on the re-evaluation of differences between the private and the public sphere, and on the public role of opinion in light of the development of new forms of communication.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE Russian Orthodox Church; Orthodoxy; liberalism; LGBT rights; religion;

AB The article examines articulation of traditional political values in the actual public discourse of the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC). The study is empirically based on the official documents of the ROC that reflect its position on socio-political issues, statements made by various synodal departments and church hierarchs, as well as statements by the representatives of the Orthodox intelligentsia who promote an alternative agenda of a dialogue between church and society. The author analyzes discursive forms of using key notions associated with two markers of traditionalist consciousness that he chose (attitude towards liberalism and position on the rights of sexual minorities), and explores the context of politicization of confessional ethical normativity. This allows him to interpret Orthodox identity as traditionalist in a political sense of the word, associated with the formation of a certain political theology and politicization of confessional ideas about morality, rather than interpreting it merely as a confessional-religious affiliation that manifests itself in various kinds of practices (going to church services etc.).

   and developing countries
AB In the coming years, robotics alongside with other labor-saving technologies (computer digital control machine-tools, artificial intelligence, additive technologies, big high-productive machinery in mining, as well as technologies that were revolutionary several decades ago like mechanization in agriculture and remote access banking) can significantly influence social and economic development via labor market. Considerable decrease of employment may result in formation of the following social groups: power and technology elites, service labor and a great number of dependents with no job. This social structure may form three types of societies. First, an analog of the ancient Rome where elite supplied people with means of subsistence and public shows. Second, a communist model of Karl Marks that was formulated in the "Critique of the Gotha Program". Third, an anti-utopia with democides, or mass murders of the own country's people exercised by a ruling power, as it was in the 20th century (the most well-known case is Holocaust). Developed states can easier adopt their social environment to technological changes than developing countries. A social experiment with basic income, which is going on in Finland now, is a concrete step to prepare for future changes in the labor market. The current political system of China also has means to meet social challenges created by new technologies, using a central planning mechanism and political control. Developing countries may get benefits from new technologies as they are more productive, but the low demand for labor will be a great problem. To solve it developing countries may give up on the export-oriented model in their social and economic development and find a new one. Possible elements of a new model can be: import substitution, South-South cooperation, and rural development instead of urbanization.

AB We look at argumentation against realizability of Hilbert's program based on Godel's incompleteness theorems. It is shown that such argumentation based on the second incompleteness theorem is incorrect from the outset, since it necessarily leads to absurd conclusions. The impossibility of a finite proof of the first incompleteness theorem is proved, which implies the non-legitimacy of the argument against the Hilbert's program based on this theorem. As a result, the textbook proposition, according to which Godel's incompleteness theorems serve as decisive arguments against feasibility of Hilbert's finitistic program is refuted.

AB Since the Ukraine crisis in 2013, citizens of Russia have improved their attitudes toward the foreign and domestic policies of their government. This process culminated in an 89% approval rating (according to Levada Center) of President Putin in 2015. In particular, Russian citizens gave unusually full support to Russian authorities in the area of foreign policy. President Vladimir Putin and his foreign policy regarding the Ukraine crisis, which became the focus of Russian mass media, took firm control of the situation to a degree unprecedented for contemporary political regimes. This study examines effects of agendasetting in the contemporary political process of Russia. The authors claim that public opinion in Russia has changed in favour of President Vladimir Putin after the Ukraine crisis as a result of agenda-setting. The findings suggest that public support was one of the main reasons for Russian foreign policy with regards to the Ukraine crisis.

What changes are man-made and therefore subjective and influenced by specific individuals and which objective. Can citizens, and to what extent, to influence these changes and where to direct its main movement and energy. For understanding contemporary reality required to reflect the most important moments of the events that are yet to give answers. So, what happens to the human community at mass, and in some ways even total, the use of digital technologies? Why you need a man these digital technologies, robotics, artificial intelligence, if the man withdraws in a virtual world, if they were being squeezed out of the social space of man himself, the Creator, make it more dependent on "machines" and the external manipulation of consciousness? The concept of "Information society" is not identical to the term "knowledge Society". Between them it is impossible to equate, as do many scientists and experts, Handle information flow much easier. Effective tools for preparation of information became available to almost everyone. But quality of content has not increased. The most important aspect in discussions about the nature and role of the digital society - is, above all, understanding of the Internet and the whole digital world from the point of view of social phenomena, from the point of view of utility and usefulness to humans. Otherwise we get technical progress, which starts to work not so much for how much contrary to the person. Classic phrase, that progress cannot be stopped, gets an ominous sound, obessmyslivaet at all for a person need participate in some creative for him personally change.

DE precedent names; linguocultural community; Russian literature; Russian
   culture; Russian history
AB The article aims to analyze the functional load of Russian precedent names in the Slovak media discourse as linguistic units that represent fragments of the national language picture of the world, in their correlation with modern reception in the Slovak media. On the material of the National Corpus of the Slovak Language (journalistic subcorpus), as well as the sites of the most popular national Slovak newspapers (Tyzden, SME, Pravda, Novy cas, Dennik N, Plus 7 dni, Trend, 24hod.sk, aktualne.sk, webnoviny.sk, Hospodarske noviny, etc.) for 2004-2017, variants of interpretation and reinterpretation of precedent names in the Slovak language picture of the world are identified; linguopragmatic features of their perception and use by the Slovak recipient are characterized; the axiological component of the semantics of Russian precedent names in the Slovak media discourse is described. The systematization of the material in the main part of the article is determined by the source of the analyzed precedent units: Russian literature and oral folk art, the political history of Russia, Russian science and culture, Russian toponyms. Methods of semantic, functional and contextual analysis are used. First of all, metaphorical meanings of precedent names are studied, as they reflect the basic historical and cultural concepts and demonstrate a way of perceiving Russian history and culture by representatives of the Slovak linguocultural community. In the process of pronomination, the common noun is replaced by a proper name which embodies all the qualities of the group and becomes a synonym to certain events, phenomena and properties. The study showed that the peculiarities of perception of precedent Russian names by the Slovak linguistic cultural community, their interpretation and reinterpretation in the modern Slovak media discourse are caused, on the one hand, by the historical interaction of the Slovak and Russian cultures and, on the other, by various changes in the social and political paradigm of the recent decades. It is established that historical and literary names of the 20th century are mostly subjected to semantic reinterpretation. The results of the study allow concluding that precedent names are not discourse-specific: they are used in texts on various topics (political, cultural, sports, social, everyday, advertising). Names from Russian literature and history are quite frequently used, while names from science, sport and culture are rare. Thus, the representation and interpretation of precedent units in the Slovak media space demonstrates the features of the reception of Russian history, politics, literature and culture by modern representatives of the Slovak linguocultural community.

Despite the seeming epistemological turn - radical change in research paradigms and adoption of methodological relativism - many today's theoretical constructions still draw on chrono-typologies characteristic of a linear progressive understanding of history. The interview deals with the philosophical foundations of anthropology, its key concepts (community, society, ethnie, ethnicity, culture, nation, identity, difference, etc.) and the relationships among these, as well as with certain analytical categories. Special attention is paid to the universal nature of the concept of 'the political-and-religious' and to its applicability to secular societies where there are manifestations of 'secular', 'civil', 'public', 'revolutionary', 'republican', and 'communist' religion. Also, the interview traces the connection between the evolutionist paradigm and the tendency toward exoticisation of the Other and 'folklorisation' of one's own people which is still inherent in many anthropological studies.

DE philosophy of mind; philosophy of language; mentalism;
   heterophenomenology; Russell
AB In this paper, we discuss the relationships between the philosophy of mind and the philosophy of language. The central thesis is that the philosophy of mind loses its metaphysical and mentalistic character when one applies the method of language analysis to the crucial problems in the philosophy of mind. This paper is divided into three parts. The first part deals with the interpretation of R. Descartes' attitude to the language. Contrary to the traditional view on his philosophy of mind as a mentalism, we argue that R. Descartes treats linguistic capacity of humans as a true criterion for the attribution of mental states. Animals and human-like machines lack the genuine language, which means that they do not have minds. Such interpretation of R. Descartes' philosophy expresses the idea of "linguisticity" of mind opposite to the tradition of mentalism. The second part examines D. Dennett's heterophenomenological method. According to him, heterophenomenology is a unique way of taking the first person point of view seriously and rejecting metaphysic entities behind it. Heterophenomenology is ontologically neutral and focuses on the narratives told by humans. The narratives are linguistic constructions that are socially embedded. Thus, D. Dennett's heterophenomenological method attempts to explain mind and consciousness through the language analysis. The third part is concerned with B. Russell's account of the relationships between the philosophy of mind and the philosophy of language. Two interpretations of these relationships are possible. The first one is based on the widely accepted belief about the method of analytic philosophy. The second one adds an ontological component to the first interpretation. This component presupposes that the stuff of the world is neither mental nor material. Such ontological presupposition allows to reject mentalism, and B. Russell's philosophy of language includes his philosophy of mind. We conclude by presenting two main results of the application of the method of language analysis in the philosophy of mind. The first one is that philosophy of mind loses its metaphysical and mentalistic character because of application of this method. The second one is that although the method of language analysis resolves metaphysical problems, it brings problems from the philosophy of language into the theory of mind. This happens due to the method is formulated within a particular philosophy of language with its own limitations.

AB The article examines the role of the "Nuclear Disarming Strikes" (NDS) concept in the context of the current informational confrontation between the USA and Russia. The author substantiates the conclusion that attacks on Russian nuclear deterrent facilities by means of the NDS would be counteracted with retaliatory strikes and inevitably have disastrous ecological, humanitarian, domestic and international political consequences for the aggressor. It is demonstrated that even militarily successful NDS against Russia would involve enormous harmful consequences for the USA. Firstly, the USA would lose the support of their current European allies, the victims of possible American nuclear explosions carried out in the European part of the Russian Federation. It is stressed that almost the entire territory of the continent would become a zone of contamination by radionuclides with total gamma radiation doses that significantly disrupt the functions of the human immune system. Tens of millions of residents of the Western part of Europe, subjected to radiation damage, would be doomed to death. People would find themselves without normal drinking water, in conditions of extreme psychological stress and degradation. Secondly, considering that the NDSs would be carried out in the context of the evolving global process of stigmatization of nuclear weapons, the aggressor runs a high risk to become a war criminal, an outcast state, and a "universal Evil". Thirdly, China, the American main geopolitical rival and trade competitor, may take advantage of the new strategic situation and try to supersede the USA in the system of the global political and economic governance. Of course, the U.S. president, guided by common sense, national egoism, and just a sense of political self-preservation, can not give consent to such an insane and criminal adventure as NDS. However, the NDS stratagem is used in the informational confrontation as a "scarecrow" to trigger panic among Russian population and bluff it into huge wasteful expenditures, thus undermining the country's competitiveness and depriving it of development prospects. The NDS bluff increases the likelihood of the use of nuclear weapons, thus undermining international strategic stability. Suggestions are offered on how to respond adequately to this challenge.

DE regression analysis; redistribution of budget transfers; elections
AB In the introduction the author demonstrates the differences in budget transfers between regions in the Russian Federation that proves the topicality of this issue. The author discusses the different strategies which politician can choose. The basic ones are: the support of "core" voters (the strategy of friends' support) and the support of "swing" voters (the strategy of pacifying opponents). The methodological part of the work is presented by correlations and regression analysis. We use the data of 55 Russian regions with several factors. As budget transfers we took the sum of budget additions into the regions corrected on the amount of people living in the region. As social and economic factors the average income, the change of gross regional product and the unemployment were taken. It is rather significant for regression model to have a homogeneity data, therefore, we took a logarithm from the transfers average income. Political factors are presented by the percent of votes for "United Russia" on parliamentary elections and for V.V. Putin on presidential elections. The results show us the positive and significant relation between the sum of transfers and political loyalty. The influence of the elections is increasing with their forthcoming, is holding during the presidential elections and decreases right after them. Although the last parliamentary elections showed the weakness of this relation. The linkage of socio-economic characteristics and budget transfers presents the support of less developed regions, with high unemployment rate and low average income. It is logically based decision to support someone who can't maintain with the financial problems by himself. The results of regression analysis revealed the more significant role of unemployment rate. This factor is the first one to decide in which region we should send money. Among parliamentary and presidential elections we fix the stronger influence of presidential voting before 2008. After this year we see the larger impact of parliamentary elections.

DE religion; science; outlook; dialog; integration
AB The main research subject is the problem relationship between religion and science in modern world. Since a unified position in relation to the evaluation of these relations is missing, the article analyzes the main approaches to solving this problem is incompatibility and conflict, independence, dialog and integration. Most contemporary researchers in this issue do not support the thesis that religion and science are in conflict with each other. The most popular is a point of view, considering religion and science as an independent field of knowledge of reality, having its own subject and methods of research. Some researchers believe that religion and science are "overlapping" region of the knowledge, particularly the concept of the structure and appearance of the world, life and man. In this areas they can dialog with each other. The adherents of the position integration believe that scientific discoveries of recent times given the opportunity to prove the truth certain religious ideas. This suggests that, over time, can form a single set of ideological views, recognized in religion and in science. From the author's point of view the processes happening today in the sphere of the relations of religion and science is complex and ambiguous. It is obvious that the institutional integration of religion and science is impossible and is not subject to any public needs. Religion and science are separate social institutions that perform different social functions. However, in the ideological field there is a constant mutual work of analysis and evaluation of ideas and concepts. New breakthroughs non-classical science in the study of the nature of matter, micro and macrocosm, creation of fundamental theories of the world, life and man in the twentieth century only reinforced this process. Interestingly, he was accompanied not only mutual criticism, as it was previously, but also the release of such concepts, ideas and representations that have identical contents and about the same are understood as in religious teachings and scientific theories. This process is due to a real social need, namely, to overcome the feeling of cognitive dissonance, which a modern person when meeting with religious and scientific ideas about the world. For this reason, the possibility of overcoming of these contradictions continues to be of interest, as theologians and scientists.

It is assumed that there is not enough space for frontier studies in the contexts of traditional history, sociology, anthropology, ethnology and interdisciplinary approaches. The author believes that studies of really existing political, social and cultural institutions are not enough for further effective and dynamic development of frontier research. The author insists that the interdisciplinary potential of studies of multiple imagined worlds of fantasy and science fiction can provide historians with a significant corpus of texts. Further analysis of the imagined worlds actualizes their frontier character. The author believes that the studies of the imagined medievalism will assist to the development and progress of frontier studies in the contexts of analysis of social, political and economic institutions. An analysis of the imagined medievalism will bring together frontier studies with political, cultural, social and economic histories.

DE Leibniz; philosophy of mathematics; univalent foundations of
   mathematics; geometrism
AB G. W. Leibniz was not the first who expressed the idea of creating a universal perfect language, but he proposed a very different approach in his project. The purpose of Leibniz's project was to represent all human knowledge in the form of a kind of "universal algebra." Leibniz intended to implement the translation into this universal language with the help of a universal characteristic, to which some special computing operations could be applied. By "characters" Leibniz meant symbols used to denote both numbers and geometric quantities. Since logic is similar to algebra, according to Leibniz, it must be built as a " universal mathematics." As part of the development of this idea, he undertook a number of attempts to arithmeticize and algebraize syllogistics. Despite the setbacks that befell Leibniz in this work, two points must be specially emphasized. First, logic was subjected to arithmetization (logical relations were represented in the form of arithmetic or algebraic ones). Secondly, it should be noted that the resulting systems were intensional (the relationship between concepts, as well as the structure of propositions acquired an intensional interpretation). Leibniz discovered some kind of correspondence between the statements of logic and the statements of geometry in the course of his research. Further development of the ideas of Leibniz was carried out by two somewhat opposite ways. The first way is to build up logic as a calculus free of all content, as a study of a pure logical form. This path is associated primarily with the algebra of logic. The second way can be traced through the ideas of Neo-Kantianism, Grassmann, J. Peano and G. Frege, through the emergence and development of type theory and, finally, in modern approaches to the foundations of mathematics, and primarily in the homotopy type theory. In modern variations of the type theory, the distinction between logical form and non-logical content ceases to be clear. In the homotopy type theory, the logical form has a geometric nature. In connection with the Leibniz's program, it should be noted that indeed the homotopy type theory has the required characteristics: it is intensional, it has a computational interpretation and directly describes calculations, it does not require the use of an external deductive system, its "logical" and "geometric" interpretations are equivalent, it does not assumes the reduction of the whole variety of mathematical entities to the entities of some special kind, and it is structuralist in its nature.

DE eurasianism; ideology. methodology and philosophy of history; historical
   narrative
AB This article discusses epistemological importance of the Eurasian interpretation of national history. Semantic core of this doctrine is ideological rationalisation of the myth connected to Russian Revolution. Eurasians have not created own philosophy of the history, meanwhile they have offered original perspective of perception of a historical material according to which the history of Russia has found a new and unusual view. They have resolutely refused to consider national history as history of Russian people and Russian state.
   The subject of historical process in their works and essays is the territory of the country. According to Eurasians the history of this space has theleological character and directs to a definite purpose of unification of the whole territory of Eurasia in one state "body".
   The Eurasian doctrine was initially perceived and designed by its creators as the effective tool of political mobilization for struggle against the Bolsheviks, that is as an ideology. They used materials and data connected to various humanitarian and natural-science disciplines on purpose to legitimize the Eurasian ideology by means of a science. These facts were taken from a scientific discourse and transformed to the ideological constructs directed to a substantiation of the Eurasian doctrine as a whole. Failure of attempts to give a satisfactory scientifically-historical proving to irrational belief in the Eurasian myth was realized by some Eurasians, and in particular by N.S. Trubetskoy.
   At the same time the requirement for such substantiation, put in public consciousness of a modern history, forced the main theorist of the Eurasian movement to create ideological texts which he characterized as "thoughtless", "tendentious", not protected from "the serious historical criticism". Trubetskoy believed that these texts are useful to the Eurasian movement from the point of view of its (movement) political ends, but aspired to keep a distance in relation to them as the scientist.
   The Eurasian conception of national history was perceived by their contemporaries as rough violence over the historical reality and the historical science. It broke off with tradition of a native historical science, conflicted to known historic facts, and in set of cases and with itself. This ideological construct carried out exclusively official function within the limits of the Eurasian ideology. Eurasians aspired to destroy the view of Russian state as Russian project and wanted to replace it with its Eurasian project. Positioning of Russia as Eurasia, Russian people as Eurasian people fixed at ideological level the new foreign-policy priorities of the future postcommunist Russia which, according to views of Eurasian theorists, should head struggle of the countries and people of Asia against political and cultural hegemony of the West.

   fathers of Church; Barsanuphius of Palestine (Barsanuphius of Gaza)
AB For fathers of Church truth it not only gnoseological, but also ontologic category. The truth for them is God. Fathers of Church consider that the Truth (God) opens Itself by means of the Saint people who assimilated to It. Many of them left behind texts which are important help in knowledge of God. However Holy Fathers though Saints, but nevertheless people. Communicating good luck, they do not turn into the weak-willed unreasonable "receivers" which are mechanically broadcasting the Divine Revelation. In this regard there is also a question, main for this article: whether the person, let and the Saint, in the Divine Revelation received by him introduces something from himself, something that disguises the Truth? Otherwise: whether it is admissible to consider everything that was told and written by Holy Fathers, occurring from God? If is not present, then how to distinguish in their creations the Truth from human opinions or, we will tell more sharply: from delusions? The answer to this essentially important question was given Barsanuphius of Palestine (the 6th century). His reasonings on this subject are of great importance for patristical gnoseology and help to understand better its specifics as gnoseology religious. According to Barsanuphius of Palestine, the gnoseological status of creations of Holy Fathers is very high: they contain knowledge gained by Saints from God. At the same time, it is impossible to tell that everything that contains in creations of Holy Fathers, is Divine knowledge: except it Saints can state and the opinions of these or those people which are not corresponding to the truth acquired in the course of training. Criterion of distinction of the Divine truth and human opinions (it is frequent - false) are the instructions of Holy Fathers on the gnoseological status of the doctrine stated by them: in case of its Divine origin the Saint points to it. At the same time, as the person, direct communicating with the Truth, the Saint cannot neither be mistaken, nor deceive. Only concerning knowledge gained from people, the Saint can, without having asked God about their gnoseological status as the person to be mistaken. But also it is not an absolute obstacle for patristical gnoseology as what remains unchecked at one Saint, is surely checked by other Saints whose set of opinions on this or that question containing direct sendings to a source of knowledge is a reliable way of finding of the Truth.

AB Law and humanism are complex phenomena of social life, phenomena, essential aspects and the existence of which determines each other. The process of becoming a legal theory of the past and present are defined by the development of the principle of humanism. If the field of the right to remove humanistic installation, the law will become anti-humanistic orientation. In the case where the humanistic theory is viewed in isolation from the practical sphere of law, we can speak about a crisis of humanism because, in this case, he remains a pure abstraction. The disclosure of substantive aspects of the concepts of "right" and "humanism" is pretty hard to avoid emotional intensity. This is complicated by the numerous stereotypes and prejudices existing in the sphere of individual and social consciousness, according to which humanism is identified with the idealism and utopianism, unlimited anthropocentrism, and the variety right is reduced to the function of social regulation.

DE geology; geology philosophy; theory of knowledge; philosophy and
   methodology of science; narratology; hermeneutics
AB The article discusses philosophical and methodological issues of the geological knowledge of the first and second half of the XIX century. Due to their specificity these issues were developed by geologists rather than philosophers. The first half of the XIX century was a formative period of Geology as an academic discipline. Some researchers offered their hypotheses in form of natural-science short novels. This in turn has led to the development of active discussions about possibility and the correctness of geological data systematization in form of narrative. The main criticism of such geological hypotheses submission among geologists consisted in the fact that such a form of submission may distract geologists from field studies. This way of hypotheses offering could focus geologists on writing scientific geological papers and writing "fiction", which is useless for science. However, despite the negative attitude towards "fiction" and narrative genre in Geology, there also were geologists who did not deny some elements of the narrative in Geology. According to A. Buckland English geologists studies have formal analogy with Sir Walter Scott works. She writes that these studies are rather "episodic and meandering narration, with poorly connected scenes and a lack of control over beginnings and endings" [A. Buckland, p. 6] Taking into account the opposing views of geologists on storytelling in Geology A. Buckland concludes that despite skepticism about the narrative of most geologists "Arguments about the form and structure of the earth and its history were always, in part, arguments about literary form and structure, too (geological hypotheses - V. M.)" [A. Buckland, p. 15]. In the second half of the XIX century the geology was attempted to form as STEM discipline. To solve this problem the boundaries of study were established, the requirements of accurate description and interpretation of geological objects and their history were offered. It is assumed that in the XIX century already Geology on the stage of its formation as an academic discipline was the narrative and the hermeneutic (interpretive) science. This fact indicates fundamental nature of humanitarian methods in this branch of science.

AB Perhaps one of the most fundamental problem of contemporary pragmatics is that of the participants in a speech events. Nevertheless this problem, its significance and interpretation, has so far been practically ignored in Russian linguistics. The purpose of this paper is to present the modern discussion field to this problem. The first part of the paper offers an summary of the problem as it stands today. I attempt to summarize the conception of participation from D. Hymes and E. Goffman to A. Bell. Wherein Goffman's concepton is more extensive than Hymes's and Bell's and the importance of it can hardly be overestimated. In the article is analyzed a three main approaches to the problem: ethnographic, sociological and sociolinguistic. The second part focuses on the limitations of the theories that illustrates by a review of the most important critical papers involving this problem. The critical direction is presented by S. Levinson, J. Irvine and W. Hanks. Emphasis is on the discussion of decomposition of participants roles and relationship between participant roles and person forms. The paper also asserts that the phenomenon of computer's communication is very difficult to explain on this thories. The theory becomes untenable when applied to account for polyloge on Internet. For examples, the Goffman's concepts of Eavesdropper and "unratified perticipant" are inadequate for explanation many forms of computer-mediated communication.

DT Article
DE neologicism; Hume's principle; abstraction principle; stipulative
   definitions
AB The paper analyzes neo-logicism of C. Wright and B. Hale. The neo-Fregean methodology is based on the introduction of the concept of number by using the abstraction principle - the Hume's principle. Abstraction principles have a distinguished status: they are a special kind of stipulation. Wright derives the basic laws of arithmetic from a stipulation governing the concept of number, without providing an explicit definition of the individual numbers or of "immediately precedes" on the basis of a purely logical vocabulary. There are challenges related to the use of stipulative definitions in the neo-Fregean philosophy of mathematics, in the first place, the so-called "bad company objection". The first difficulty is that the use of the principles of abstraction, for example, Axiom V Frege, can lead to a contradiction. In response, Wright and Hale demonstrate that the presence of erroneous principles of abstraction does not mean that methodology is irremediably flawed. The second difficulty is next. Given the fact that some abstraction principles are inconsistent with each other, it is necessary to supplement the account with a criterion capable of governing the choice of one abstraction over another. Wright and Hale suggest as a solution to this difficulty the use of the criterion of "conservatism", according to which an abstraction principle is acceptable if it does not constrain the cardinality of concepts with whose introduction it is not explicitly concerned. However, this solution is also problematic. Wright and Hale maintains that the existence of numbers is something discovered rather than stipulated, while holding that our a priori knowledge of their necessary existence is derived from a principle truth is a matter of stipulation. They're trying to show that Hume's principle merely lays down partial satisfaction conditions for the relation of numerical identity. The main difficulty of the neo-Fregean methodology, indeed, is with transition from the characterization of the truth of Hume's principle as a simple stipulation to its deployment as a truth having significant existential implications. Presently, these discussions are still ongoing and decisions are pending.

DE Russian image; mass media; western press; V.V. Putin; information policy
AB It is widely known that the modern Russian international image is currently under considerable pressure of the western mass media, political actors, and academic community. It is the reason why the problem of the international image should be closely considered for revealing criticism patterns, unviable elements of the image policy, and for adjusting informational policy. Russian researchers pay great attention to external factors (western politicians, massmedia and academic community), affecting the image. However the internal ones are considered not so widely. This academic paper is dedicated to research of the internal challenges, influencing effectiveness of Russia's international image in general and its information campanies in particular. We assume that these internal challenges have no less considerable affect on Russian international image than external ones. We assume that the basis of these internal challenges is fails of the current Russian government in the number of crucial issues, related to mass media communication and long-term image development strategy. In the process of research we used academic works of Russian researchers and western experts in Russian studies, reports of a number of western think tanks and research centers, results of sociological research, and mediatexts of quality pressmedia the Economist and the New York Times for 2011-2016 years. The analysis of the mentioned materials revealed a number of the internal factors, affecting the international image, such as: closed nature and informational reactivity of the modern Russian political elites, the conflict of national and international media messages, the lack of coordination between key actors in international image activities, and negative stereotypes / extremely critical attitude towards Russia (the latter one may not be a completely an internal factor but it should be taken into account as it forms a basis for the image perception). It is important to say that all these factors are tightly interconnected and negative effect of one can not be minimized without dealing with the rest. As a result we believe that the present internal image challenges are as important as external ones. Secondly, Russia should considers elimination of the internal challenges as one of the most important missions in the foreseen future, otherwise it can face with further degradation of the international image and lost of this essential instrument.

   analysis; discourse strategies; conceptual metaphor; megametaphor
AB This research is an attempt to uncover the key conceptual metaphors, discourse strategies and tactics that underlie the political essay The Spirit of Russia by a radical proponent of Ukrainian nationalism Dmytro Dontsov. The legacy of this political thinker is still widely used by the Ukrainian nationalists (OUN) who are inspired by his ideals of race struggle, national will and his strong opposition to everything Russian. Though Dontsov's writings have garnered much attention in historical research, there are few if any studies that mention The Spirit of Russia, where Dontsov paints a grim picture of the supposed Russian nationalism, messianism and barbarism, and portrays Russia as a threat to the Western world. The key conceptual metaphor (megametaphor) underlying the whole essay is RUSSIA IS ANTICHRIST. It is manifested through a series of mappings from the domains of the Christian religion (CHRIST, ANTICHRIST, DEVIL, POSSESSION, BEAST, etc.) to the domains of RUSSIA, UKRAINE, EAST, WEST, etc. While these conceptual metaphors are important cognitive devices by themselves, they also serve to implement Dontsov's discourse strategies: to persuade the reader of the danger inherent in Russia as a state, and to create the positive image of Europe (Ukraine being a part of it) as the last bastion in the fight against evil and the negative image of Russia as the very evil to be fought against and ultimately eliminated. The tactics or discursive moves used to implement these strategies include, among others, regular usage of pejorative epithets applied to both the Soviet Russia and the Russian Empire, parallel construction that seek to negatively compare Russia to Europe, and repeated inclusion of Ukraine into the list of European countries.

   CENTURY IN THE LIGHT OF THE HISTORY OF CONCEPTS

LA Russian
DT Article
DE history of concepts; problem of serfdom in Russia; freedom; slavery;
   property
AB The paper develops a practically-oriented pattern for studying the history of public thought with the help of methods of present day's history of concepts. To solve this task, the author postulates the principle of variety of genres of historical sources and the principle of a focused study of the system of social and political concepts within certain thematic fields. The practical implementation of these principles is exemplified in the comparative analysis of meanings and contexts of the use of concepts 'freedom', 'slavery' and 'property' in public and non-public texts which were created by the authors of the first quarter of the 19th century to deliberate upon the problem of serfdom. The analyzed sources include articles from journals like Vestnik Evropy, Syn Otechestva, Arkhiv istoricheskii i politicheskii; archival papers of O.P. Kozodavlev, M. Balugyanskiy, A. Druzhinin, as well as peasants' addresses regarding 'freedom from slavery'. The study resulted in determining the peculiarities of the use of the concepts 'freedom', 'slavery' and 'property' in public and non-public communication in different social groups of Russian society of the first quarter of the 19th century. For public texts, it is characteristic to affirm the historical genesis of 'slavery' in different countries of the world, to morally disapprove of 'slavery' and to support the natural character of 'freedom'. At the same time, the journals were writing about the buyout of slaves in Asia and Africa and about laws regulating the liberation of peasants. All this was contributing to the emergence of two main scenarios of possible liberation in the minds of Russian readers: either by the buyout on the side of peasants, or by the liberating law on behalf of the state power. In texts of projects that were devoted to the softening or cancellation of serfdom, 'property' was emerging as a key concept in connection with the concept 'slavery'. Gradually, the authors were moving from the unconditional recognition of the 'freedom' of a person to the question of contractual relations between peasants and owners of the land. In such a context, one of the ways to cancel the personal dependence of peasants upon their masters was the project of granting the right to buy land with peasants to other, non-noble social groups of Russian society. On the level of peasants' addresses 'slavery', however, was not an abstract category used to describe peasants' status in general, but a concrete term used to stress the inhuman character of punishment, the illegal status of possession by the non-nobles, or any other circumstances that gave peasants a chance to submit a petition to grant them 'freedom'.

   conservative model of social behavior; liberal model of social behavior
AB The objective of the article is to reconstruct the mental programs, their cognitive, axiological and connotative structures, and construction on this basis of various modal patterns of social behavior in Russian health care. Methodology of the article is based on an constructive realism making it possible to conceptually disclose the contents of reflexive structures of mental programs that determine modal patterns of social behavior. On the basis of the cognitive construction the author identifies the distinctive features of the two alternative modal patterns of social behavior: liberal pattern and conservative pattern in the sphere of medical care consumption in modern Russian society. However, in real life, as shown by empirical data, these patterns are mostly hybrid: conservative-liberal, as they include elements of the liberal behavior pattern. These patterns were formed in the context of both the transformation of Russian health care system and the regeneration of state-centric matrix of its development. Their formation has also been greatly influenced by changes in the mass health consciousness of Russians, many of whom, having experienced in the early 1990s an euphoria from liberal modernization projects, now complain not only about the results of health reforms in Russia, but about their wellbeing. Scientific modeling of medical care consumption reveals its features typical for different social groups, as well as makes it possible to better understand the self-preservation practices in contemporary Russian health care. The study of the regulators of social behavior in the sphere of medical care consumption is dominated by two approaches: personality and situational. Currently, there is tendency of overcoming the cognitive one-sidedness of personality and situational approach. In line with this trend, the social behavior of a patient is not regarded as the result of influence of the social situation or his individual traits, social values, attitudes and cultural predispositions. The social behavior of medical care consumers is seen primarily as a result of their interpretation of the social situation of health problems and "attributing" to it the values and meanings in a socio-cultural context of health care system.

DT Article
DE Belarusian - Russian relations; the Union State; EU - Belarusian
   relations; Ukrainian crisis
AB The paper focuses on the post- Soviet history of Belarusian foreign policy through the lens of its relations with Russia. It aims at finding out which of the foreign policy strategies tested by Belarus has been the most adequate to its national interests. The paper's significance consists in the application of the concepts developed by the international relations theory with the purpose of explaining the foreign policies of "small states" to the analysis of the foreign policy of Belarus as a small state indirectly involved in the conflict between Russia and the EU. The authors evaluate the consequences of Minsk foreign policy for the future relations between Russia and Belarus. The research employs the neorealist theory of international relations and uses the methods of political description, observation, analysis of documents and political discourse. The authors distinguish three periods of the post- Soviet Russian - Belarusian relations. In 1991-1993, Belarus sought a military-political neutrality. After 1994, the foreign policy of Belarus was founded on the military-political alliance and economic integration with Russia. Despite all the problems and contradictions, this policy was pursued until 2014. In 2014-2017, with the sharp deterioration in relations between Russia and the West, Belarus shifted to the policy of manoeuvring between Russia and the EU. Although this policy brings tactical gains to Belarus, the authors argue that it does not contribute to the long-term national interests of the country and is fraught with serious risks for Belarusian statehood. The research suggests a hypothesis that in higher-risk national situations the strategic choice of small states can deviate to riskier foreign policy patterns. The authors predict the increased estrangement between Russia and Belarus and exacerbated contradictions in bilateral relations.

DE theory of language-games; the problem of the nature of philosophy; the
   metaphilosophical paradox
AB The paper is concerned with metaphilosophical cases in which the assumption that there is no subject matter of philosophy is based on the position called 'the theory of language games'. In the contemporary philosophy of language there are a number of popular positions which based on the similar understanding of language. This popularity gives to the metaphilosophical paradox of that understanding and to the metaphilosophical difficulties which that understanding brings a certain value. The metaphilosophical paradox of 'the theory of language games' consists in the impossibility of that that understanding of language to explain the difference between the contemplation of the rule by a philosopher and the analogous contemplation by a rule-follower. That impossibility gives way to losing difference between two. The paradox could also be stated in the following way: the theory of language games' depicts the language in manner analogous to the way how a family portrait images a family. The paradox emerges from our attempts to place philosophy on that portrait. Also the paper provides the analysis of the difficulties which that understanding brings for the solving of the problem of philosophy. Using the example of the aim of philosophy, the method of philosophy and the nature of philosophical problems the author shows that 'the theory of language games' could say nothing noncontroversial about the nature of philosophy. The aim of philosophy according to 'the theory of language games' is or the removing of the philosophical confusions or the conceptual analysis. For both of them it is necessary to see language games from some meta-perspective. The right method of philosophy according to 'the theory of language games' is the describing of the language games. Such method to be pointed out should be based on some kind of rules. The nature of philosophical problems according to 'the theory of language games' is grammatical. Nevertheless, to describe something as the philosophical problem there should be given some theoretical basis. In the end author made a conclusion that 'the theory of language games' is not a sufficient position for solving the problem of the nature of philosophy.

AB In July 2016 the European Commission proposed an amendment that would authorize a use of a portion of funds reserved under one of Foreign Policy Instruments - the Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace (IcSP) - to finance capacity- building of military and security actors in third countries from the EU budget. This proposal became a new manifestation of internalization of 'security-development nexus' as a paradigmatic basis of the current EU foreign policy. It has been scrutinized by the European policy-makers, lawyers and experts, who assessed its conformity with the EU constitutive acts, the DAC OECD directives on ODA-eligibility and the idea of development cooperation in general. The paper also examines the origins and the essence of a proposed amendment as well as the process, substance and outcomes of the relevant debates at various EU platforms. The conclusion is drawn on complex political and economic reasons behind the revision due to come into force by the end of 2017. Expanding the scope of the IcSP and expressing solidarity with the views of the leading member states, the representatives of the EU institutions pursue strategic and economic objectives. In spite of budgetary constraints, they prevent "security" and "development" from clashing and seek available ways, including the ones, which legally are not obvious, to meet increasingly large security demands and to fulfill unprecedented global commitments in development cooperation.

AB The article analyzes the systemic reasons of the strategic reorientation of Poland after 1989 from East to West in the historical context. The author indicates the main tasks of the Polish diplomacy of that period using the neorealist approach of K. Waltz. It is based on the idea that after 2007 the European and Atlantic vector of Polish foreign policy came into a state of latent competition. On the basis of content analysis of the programmes of the main political parties the author draws a conclusion that the historical choice made by political leaders resulted in a split of Polish society into traditionalists and modernists. The concluded is that the Polish elites, who came to power in 1989, have missed a historic opportunity to build new beneficial Polish- Russian relations conducive to establishing a stable, free and democratic Poland.

AB Traditionally it is believed that the birthplace of the jury trial creation is England, but the issue of the birthplace location of this particular form of popular participation in the criminal justice administration is not yet fully resolved by the historical science. The continental lawyers were particularly interested in the jury trial among other institutions of English law, in which the English themselves identified the stronghold of the country's law and order, its political and civil freedom. It is not difficult to see that the main role was not played by the judges, but by the community representatives in this form of justice administration. Since then the community has been gaining more and more importance in England as a state body in the matter of justice administration, and the initial forms of its activity have being further developed in this direction. This works investigates roots of jury trial by basing on such methods as historical, systemic, formally logical, concrete-historical, comparative legal analysis method. The authors, in turn, come to the conclusion that the jury trial has its roots still in the Ancient States, but the classical modern model owes its origin to England.

DE Greece; Brexit; Grexit; EU referendum; European Union
AB The article examines the British referendum in 2016 through the prism of perception of another member state of the European Union - Greece. Based on the materials of the official Greek press and statements of politicians of various levels the author also analyzes the position of the main Greek party leaders, politicians and the opinion of Greek citizens about the current situation in the UK and the further EU development. The historical decision of the British to withdrawal from the EU echoed strongly in Greece. Different categories of its population expressed solidarity with the results of the referendum. At the same time the fears spread about the possibility of the imminent decline of the national and the EU economies, as well as the inevitable weakening of the European integration process and the reduction of the political weight of the united Europe. However, after Brexit the worst-case scenario for Greece would be Grexit - exit of Greece from the European Union. These fears have certain ground because Greece is considered the weakest EU member. Some EU countries sooner or later might wish to get rid of the most problematic country.

AB This study is devoted to forecasting the Russian Gazprom natural gas production from the Tyumen region's fields and its production potential in the context of the Russian economic crises and foreign economic restrictions that has taken place since 2014, including a reduction in external and domestic demand for Russian natural gas as well as for gas of Gazprom. On the basis of gas production function estimated for 1985-2008 we make forecasts for 2017 of Gazprom gas production in Tyumen region (where the company is producing more than 90% of its gas) and estimate the underutilized production potential of PJSC Gazprom in this region for 2014-2016. Basing on the additional econometric study of Gazprom gas production function (with labour) in the Tyumen Region we have empirically proved the growth of the coefficient of the company's neutral technical progress since 2014, one of the consequences of which, according to the author, was a continuous decline since 2014 the unit cost of natural gas production of the Gazprom subsidiary "Gazprom dobycha Nadym", which operates the largest Bovanenkovskoye oil and gas condensate field in the Yamal Peninsula which reserves are estimated to be 4.9 trill. cub. m of gas. It is concluded that in the Russian economic crisis that has been intensified since 2014 as well as the foreign economic and political restrictions that have been started in the same year, in the segment of gas production Russian Gazprom continues to be an effective natural monopoly with an increasing coefficient of neutral technical progress, declining average gas production cost in new fields and minimal production costs, the marginal and average values of which coincide and do not depend on the volumes of gas produced.

AB Modern childhood is constantly changing; it reflects all the socio-cultural, economic and political transformations of society and the world of adults. Sociology of childhood as a specific branch of sociology needs adequate methods of empirical data collection and analysis, the creation of new explanatory and prognostic theories, and the development of a professional scientific community. In Soviet Russia, sociology has long been stigmatized as an anti-social bourgeois science; therefore, its development was slowed down for years. Further, the party elite began to use sociology for ideological propaganda. The stages of development of child sociological research correspond to the logic of sociology development in the USSR -a flowering of Russian sociological studies of childhood in the beginning of the XX century was turned into persecution and oblivion in the 1940-1950s, and further into the revival of the sociological studies of children in 1960-70s in keeping with the existing ideology. A crisis in the Russian society in the 1990s caused a new resurgence of interest in children.
   The work represents the content analysis of articles about children and childhood published in the Russian journal Sotsiologicheskie Issledovaniya (Sociological Studies) for the period 1990-2014. The goal of the study was to reveal the main tendencies of development of the Russian sociology of childhood. We analysed a total of 128 articles. The review enabled to identify the dominant topics of studying childhood, empirical issues of organization, conduct and interpretation of the obtained data, and to describe the studies according to their localization, duration, age groups of child respondents and used methods of data collection and processing. The materials of expert interviews with specialists in the field of studies devoted to childhood enabled to reveal empirical and theoretical-methodological difficulties of studying childhood and children.
   The results of the study indicate the prevalence of a socialization approach in studying childhood among Russian sociologists, the deficiency of "soft" methods of study, the use of educational establishments for sociological surveys of children, and the insufficient knowledge of pre-school children. The Russian sociology of childhood has an uncertain status. It faces the disintegration of a scientific community and the insufficient participation of young researchers. All this decelerates the development of methodological grounds for sociological studies of childhood.

The author of the article examines information contained in the records of the 38th Siberian Rifle Reserve Battalion (Regiment) of the 5th Siberian Rifle Reserve Brigade and the 23rd Siberian Rifle Reserve Battalion (Regiment) of the 4th Siberian Rifle Reserve Brigade, stored in the state archives of Novosibirsk and Tomsk Oblasts. The author got acquainted with the data on marching companies, beginning from their formation until their arrival at the front. The information considered indicates that the mechanism for the formation of marching companies was well established, as a result of which several officers were responsible for the company, including the commander of a regular company under which it was trained. The dispatch of the company to the front was also carefully prepared and controlled, shortly before it several events were held, including a review and a prayer. A whole staff of officers was called upon to monitor the order in the train on the way to the front. On the way, soldiers periodically made attempts to escape, which were stopped with varying success by the officers accompanying them. During this period, different reserve regiments of the Omsk Military District prepared a different number of companies, which is explained by the different time of their formation and the different level of competence of their officers. After the February Revolution, the Omsk Military District began to experience considerable difficulties with the preparation of marching companies. It began to lack men, the speed of the formation of the companies dropped significantly, the least efficient contingent from the number of deserters, people previously exempted from military service and militiamen was sent to the front as part of marching companies. Appeals to patriotism and the creation of democratic bodies, supposed to improve the situation, did not lead to anything - the soldiers thought, mainly, about being sent to field works, and the officers were engaged in political struggle in the newly formed democratic bodies. The last dispatch of marching companies in the 38th Siberian Rifle Reserve Regiment took place in August 1917, when it managed to send some companies formed in April. The rest were disbanded.

TI PRO-RUSSIAN FOREIGN POLICY POSITIONS OF THE DAGESTAN POLITICAL ELITE IN
   THE 1780S-1790S
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Dagestan possessors; pro-Russian orientation; policy of Russia;
   citizenship; protection
AB The work aims to study the process of strengthening the foreign policy orientation of the Dagestani political elites in Russia in the late eighteenth century, to uncover the causes of this phenomenon. The basis for achieving this aim was archival documents and other published sources. The study shows that the defeat of Turkey in the Russian-Turkish war of 1768-1774 was the turning point in the foreign political orientation of the rulers of Dagestan in Russia's favor. It is established that the strengthening of Pro-Russian positions of Dagestani rulers was influenced by the accession of the Crimea and Kuban to Russia and the adoption of Georgia into the Russian citizenship. Feeling the powerful force of Russia, once it became known about the signing of the Treaty of Georgievsk, rulers of Dagestan testified their loyalty to Russia. The Shamkhal of Tarki, the Umma-Khan of Avaria, Andian elders and many others declared their desire to be in Russian citizenship. Intensification of Russian-Dagestani political ties resulted in the dissatisfaction of the Sultan. Turkey hopes laid on the uprising that began in Chechnya under the leadership of Sheikh Mansur. However, such prominent Dagestani figures as the Shamkhal of Tarki, the khans of Avaria and KaziKumukh did not join this movement, and replied with a categorical refusal. Russian authorities learned about this refusal of Dagestani rulers and were satisfied with it. Rejecting suggestions of Sheikh Mansur and, accordingly, High Porte patronizing him, the politicians of Dagestan actively sought citizenship of Russia. In 1784, the Shamkhalate of Tarki decided to formalize its accession to Russia. This example was followed by many others. During 1786-1787 almost all of Dagestani rulers resumed oaths of allegiance to Russia: Aksai, Kostek, Enderi lords, the UmmaKhan of Avaria, KaziKumukh and Kyurin khans, qadi Rustam of Tabasaran and other lords. As is known, Turkey, which began to prepare for war with Russia since 1787, using the active support of the Western powers, did not appreciate this. On 24 August 1787, it declared war on Russia. With the beginning of military actions, Selim III appealed to the peoples of the Caucasus to fight against Russia. Oddly enough, the sultan's appeals found no support in Dagestan. Moreover, the rulers of Dagestan delivered the firmans of the sultan in the original to the Caucasian commanders, assuring the Imperial power in its allegiance to Russia. In September 1789, the Shamkhal of Tarki and Ahmed-Khan of Derbent declared their loyalty and willingness to serve Russia to the Russian commanders. As evidenced by the sources, in 1791 a delegation of the Dagestani ruling elite including Zasulak princes, the Shamkhal of Tarki, the Khan of Derbent and others came to Petersburg to address the question of Russian citizenship. In the course of the study the author comes to a conclusion that Russia, repeatedly patronizing the peoples of Dagestan defended them during the threat of invasion by Shah Agha-Mohammad Khan. In turn, the rulers of Dagestan, realizing the serious consequences and ruin the Iranian ruler's campaign could cause, Russian troops provided effective assistance and support, which ultimately led to the Shah's refusal from the expedition against Dagestani peoples. The study showed that the departure of the Iranian army created favorable conditions for the annexation of Dagestan to the Russian Empire.

AB In recent times political events started to exert more and more significant impact on national financial systems due to sharpening of political problems in various countries. Undoubtedly, their influence can be followed in price dynamics of stocks which are trading in the securities market. The need to understand political news impact on the market as a whole and its separate industries is faced by investors and market agents for proper orientation in market environment. Since this issue provides rather controversial results in different studies, the authors set the aim to investigate the Russian market with the use of GARCH models. Such approach allowed determining precisely the political events' influence on return and volatility of market assets as well as leverage and clusterization effects. The obtained results may be beneficial for investors, operating in the Russian stock market, other market agents and specialists in the field of financial science.

DE Russia; Portugal; history of interstate relations; cooperation; trade;

AB Russia and Portugal established diplomatic relations in the last quarter of the 18th century. Since that time, they experienced natural periods of rise and fall. Russia and Portugal are not comparable on many parameters: size of territory, population and workforce, the volume of economy, etc. In its turn, the Portuguese nation also can boast of considerable achievements. Political or ideological considerations have always dominated in bilateral relations, which for a long time have prevented building cooperation in accordance with strategic interests. The membership of Portugal in NATO and accession to the European Communities in 1986 obliged Lisbon to form its relations with Moscow in line with overall negotiation processes of these international associations and with an eye on the partners' position. In certain periods, this fact made it difficult to engage in a constructive dialogue, forcing both sides to see each other through the prism of global confrontation between two hostile social and political systems. At the same time, there has never been acute, intractable disagreements or open conflicts between the two countries. High-level visits and the ruling elites' interest degree were of great importance for the development of the bilateral relations. In this respect, the period of 1990s and 2000s belonged to the most fruitful. The legal base of cooperation was expanded, important treaties were signed, an exchange of the heads of state visits took place during this time. However, in the following years of the global financial and economic crisis, the Russia-Portugal political relations stalled, later hampered by the consequences of the Ukrainian crisis and the sanctions war. Largely due to the change of political power in Portugal in 2015, contacts between Moscow and Lisbon have a chance to restart. The current government and the President hold a more flexible position towards Russia, seek new opportunities for development of a mutually beneficial dialogue. However, even the years of political difficulties did not stop cooperation in trade, tourism and culture. These areas have become the three pillars for resumption of the dialogue today.

AB The article attempts to examine the features of the contemporary development of historiography of scientists of the Union State of Russia and Belarus on the problems of Belarus-Russia relations (1991-2016). The historiography of the Union State is understood as the latest research of Russian and Belarusian researchers that studies areas of cooperation of two countries. These studies were performed in the field of history and political science, economics and sociology, international relations and law, philosophy and psychology. The problems of Russian-Belarusian relations as well as the problems of Belarusian-Russian integration are reflected in the latest historic and historiographic publications. At the same time, it is necessary to say that at the moment there are no research publications that show the latest Russian, Belarusian and foreign historiography on the development of Belarus-Russia relations in 19912016. The historiographic sources the author used represent the current state and level of scientific thought of the research communities of Russia and Belarus on the problems of interstate cooperation in the following spheres of interaction: energy sphere, military cooperation, scientific cooperation and Belarusian-Russian cooperation in the information sphere. Moreover, the article lists the main Russian and Belarusian universities, research and analytical centers, leading scientific institutes that engage in studying the abovementioned problems. A complex and multilateral study of the phenomenon of the formation and development of Belarus-Russia relations seems extraordinarily important in contemporary circumstances. At present, the necessity of a profound and objective comprehension of the development of modern international relations in the post-Soviet space is actualized in connection with a periodical unfavorable aggressive external-politic and external-economic conjuncture. The publication of this article can be viewed not only as an attempt to fill some research lacunas in science, but also as a peculiar form of historiograpic mediation between modern researchers. The author concludes that the results of a lot of perspective scientific research and developments have not found practical application in the development of external-politic and external-economic courses of Russia and Belarus and in the development of integration interaction between the countries yet.

TI THE EXPERIENCE OF COMPILING THE DEPORTED PEOPLE MEMORIAL BOOKS: ISSUES

DT Article
DE data bases; memorial book; special settlers
AB The paper is devoted to the problem of database creation and to the preparation of Memorial Books on deported people. Principles of creation of public information resources, methods of selection and processing of mass personal sources for this category of repressed people are presented in this article. Six million people were engaged in the system of special settlements, that is about one million people more than those who were prosecuted on the political motives. In the three-million database called "Victims of Political Terror in the USSR" created by the Memorial Society and integrating all ethnic and regional Memorial Books and martyrologies published or prepared in post-soviet countries, only one third of notes deals with deported people. State projects focused on the preservation of memory about victims of political terror are being implemented in all post-soviet countries. However, there are some limits on processing of personal data. In Russia these limits are extended to all files of repressed people, which substantially complicated activities of both specialists of the respective departments and historians on the implementation of the state programme. By now, the requirements referring to data bases containing information about repressed people, which are to be published as Memorial Books are standardised. According to the national laws such publications should perform information functions and contain personal information on the history of repressions open and accessible to a wider circle of interested people. The analysis of Memorial Books on exiled people showed that there was a limited number of such publications and they were only devoted to peasants and their family members deported in the beginning of the 1930s. There is even a smaller number of ethnicity-based publications (devoted to Germans, Poles, etc.). These publications allowed to conclude that rehabilitation is finished neither as the official, state task, nor in the context of social resonance and preservation of historical memory about political repressions. Preliminary results of the Russian-Armenian team work engaged in compiling martyrology of 16 000 ethnic Armenians deported to the Altai and Narym regions as "dashnaks" and "citizens of Turkey" during the deportation of 14 June 1949 are addressed. The integrated data base on the prosecuted Armenians contains information on 30 parameters and addresses the data on the national and social status of the deported, their family status, their residence before deportation and in exile, and also on their liberation and rehabilitation. Possibilities of creation of the integration data bases based on files of deportation of families that are kept in the National Archive of Armenia corrected with statistical data from the Information Centre of the Ministry of the Internal Affairs from Altai Krai are demonstrated in the paper.

AB The article investigates the examples of verbal aggression manifestations in publicistic texts that assess the modern broadcasting practice and the content of the main Russian television companies, "Literaturnaya gazeta", one of the popular weekly periodicals in Russia. In each issue of this newspaper, several articles were published with an assessment of the quality of television broadcasts. Having studied the archives of "Literaturnaya gazeta" issues (260 in total) for the period of 2012-2016, we found 842 articles containing both positive and negative evaluations of TV shows, the work of the TV show hosts and the trends of modern federal television broadcasting. Using the methods of "Literaturnaya gazeta" continuous monitoring, a quantitative and a content analysis of its articles and the comparison of the articles of television critics published in different years, we found out that a large part of the analyzed articles, the thing was about television programs and famous persons taking part in them. Having analyzed the style of information presentation in the publications of television critics of "Literaturnaya gazeta", we found out that verbal aggression over the chronological period of the research was one of the frequently used methods to develop a negative public opinion about the practice of the main Russian television channel functioning. In 2012-2016 this language phenomenon was applied in relation to television programs, television personalities and to characterize a social-political situation in the country where Russian television operates. We believe that the regular appeal of critics to verbal aggression testifies to the desire of "Literaturnaya gazeta" authors to influence the audience more emotionally than rationally and follow a simple path, revealing and replicating the negative.

DE death; social; time; immortality; old age
AB The influence of the accelerated pace of life to social relation to death in contemporary society is considered in the article. Technology has liberated people from many routine tasks, leaving the possibility of creative life for them. However, released for creativity time is being mercilessly destroyed in society of consumerism and mass culture. Acute shortage of time creates a new image of society in which death has no place. Forms of social learning of space expand, creating a social escapism which is an escape from reality into the sphere of the social.
   Death as the last bastion of reality is strongly ignored, and a society supports the socio-psychological setting of continuous social activity and productivity, which contribute to belief in overcoming of death, or social immortality. At the same time, society realizes the hollowness of such immortality, because nobody is exempt from physical death. People begin to experiment with reality, constantly generating new forms of duration: marriage is no longer seen as an eternal union, the work is not a place to which man is bound all his life. Contemporary man has an unusually long life, using countless possibilities.
   Death is tabooed by both the acceleration of the pace of life and the growth of social in man. The breach of the taboo puts the marginal position all humans, who are touched with a death. The largest of this marginal groups are old-aged people. Being outside of the active social life, they inhabit "social desert" of contemporaneity, in which life is too close to death. Because of this proximity to a death old-aged people are exposed to all kinds of segregation and discrimination.
   Aforesaid phenomena create a need for a kind of "thanatological reform", which will redefine the social in terms of mass and infinite acceleration in the pace of life in favor of friendly cooperation and temporal continuity. The reform involves changes in various areas: art, science, politics, law, education. Breaking the taboo from the death marks the total freedom and responsibility, when people do not simply increase the number of created forms, but fill them with qualitative content, for which they are responsible. Thus, a society has a proper place for a death.

DE Research University; organizational structure of university; adaptation
   mechanism; competition
AB The article touches upon the issue of adaptation mechanism of university organizational structures under the conditions of market economy. The potential of adaptation mechanism is revealed.
   The authors propose the idea that adaptability is based on the internal diversity of combined conglomerate structures. The issue of adaptation is considered from the perspective of national higher education systems. Transnational perspective of organizational structures transformation in higher education is set out. The author clarifies the specificity of horizontal and vertical differentiation, both related to intrastructures and interconnection structures and relations (sectors, layers, sections and their hierarchy). It is shown that the processes of horizontal and vertical differentiation promote the transformation of higher education systems on the one hand and resist these transformations on the other hand. The author provides examples why certain bases and principles of organizational structures in higher education (for example, organizational structure, where a department plays the role of a base) lose its vitality and start to transform. A comparative analysis of horizontal and vertical differentiation of higher education systems is carried out; the potential of differentiation in the dynamics of institutional growth in the competitive environment of higher education is revealed.
   In the conclusion of this article the author refers to the concept of "institutional comprehensive university". It is stated that the nature of such university is similar to the nature of a holding company; the principles on which the integral construction of a "comprehensive university" is based present the principles of differentiation and formal equality. As it is shown in the article, these principles may be hardly connected.
   It is concluded that flexible, mobile, open organizational system of higher education may show and use its abilities and adaptive mechanisms to a greater extent and degree. It provides a great opportunity of access to education, as well as the connection with labor market. In addition, this type of system provides support for the elite function of university education - for research function.

AB The article is dedicated to one of the most important problems of Spain's foreign policy - territorial, namely the problem of two Spanish enclaves located on the territory of Morocco - Ceuta and Melilla, as well as Gibraltar. The historical and legal provisions form the basis of arguments of Spain, Morocco and Great Britain substantiating their claims to these disputed territories. A comparison is made between the problems of Ceuta/Melilla and Gibraltar. Particular attention is paid to the question of whether Ceuta and Melilla are covered by NATO's security guarantee. Morocco is using the issue of Ceuta and Melilla as an instrument to exert pressure on Spain in order to get benefits in other areas, including immigration, trade and fishing as well as to change its position on the Western Sahara. It is emphasized that illegal immigration mostly from sub-Saharan countries is one of the main problems in Spanish-Moroccan relations, complicating the situation in Ceuta and Melilla. This problem is far from being resolved. The Anglo-Spanish dispute over Gibraltar is determined by its important strategic position and the presence of the NATO naval base. The necessity to respect the rights of an absolute majority of its population is empathized. For the UK, the question of Gibraltar is primarily associated with the challenge of maintaining its military-strategic position in the Mediterranean, for Spain - with the problem of its sovereignty and territorial rights. Currently, there is a process of "natural integration" between Gibraltar and adjacent Spanish territory. Spanish experience in resolving the territorial dispute over Gibraltar is important as a practical experience of long-term and complex negotiations. Its final solution must be sought through development of integration processes in Europe. The main task of the Western countries regarding Spanish territorial problems is the maintenance of stability in the region, which perfectly meets the interests of Spain. Madrid's efforts are focused primarily on prevention of such development of political and economic situation, which would force the country to strengthen its southern border by military means. This strategic objective has become particularly relevant in the context of recent events in North Africa.

DE freedom; libertas; Greek patristic
AB Attitude towards freedom creates two fundamentally different directions in the articulation of the key ideas for understanding the phenomenon of the human person, to issue in the Latin West and the Greek East.
   Representatives of the Greek patristic express a specific unanimity in the negative interpretation of freedom, which receives the name of "disastrous" and is perceived as the source of sin and the root of all evil. Libertas is interpreted as a test to overcome that man was not capable of. As an example, many thinkers turn to the Old Testament story of the Fall of Adam.
   In Greek patristic gradually formed a firm conviction that freedom is destructive to human personality and spiritual development. Therefore, the foundation of ascetic practices, rooted in the IV century kin, is the fixation of attention on cutting off their own will, the subject, which is dedicated to a significant body of literature of the period. Freedom is not fraught with the danger to humans when fed by God as spiritual growth.
   However, the freedom and the location of the heart in representatives Cappadocian schools is a necessary condition not only to every good work, and spiritual development.
   In the treatises of thinkers of the patristic period postulated freedom from fear, and there is a new concept of "fear of God", that is, sin and failure to follow the commandments.
   However, in the Greek patristic there are opinions that stand out from the canvas thinking about the phenomenon of freedom in the context of understanding the human person: the denial of freedom within the boundaries of the world partite (Isaac the Syrian), the idea of freedom from suffering (Ephraim of Syria).
   The concept of Maximus the Confessor loss of true freedom, that is integrity, which is the core image of the personality, led to the fall of man. General at the western and eastern representatives of patristic is the idea of freedom from attachment to the world and all that fills it.
   In the works of Western thinkers of the patristic period, in the context of the individual key advocates question the relation of divine grace and free will, the Greek - is the central idea of his own will to achieve eradication and desire to live according to God's will. Disclosure of the ontological foundation of human existence, the essence of personality in man, identifying the internal foundations of his personality is possible only if the full elimination of their own will, and that is equivalent to the absolute understanding of freedom as such.

AB The relevance of the problem under study is caused by multi-confessional character of Russian society and the need of power to take into account the specific features of each confession in its religious policy. In order to understand the essential characteristics of contemporary issues in the state-confessional and inter-confessional relations the events and the processes taking place in the atheist Soviet past should be examined carefully. The purpose of the article is to study the specifics of the relationship between the authorities and associations of Evangelical Christians-Baptists during 1960s - 1980s, using the example of such a multi-confessional region as Tatarstan. The leading approach to the study of this problem was the civilizational approach, which enabled a comprehensive study of the object under study. The main results of the study are the studying of Tatar ASSR Baptist association forms and ways in the context of Soviet political and legal realities. The materials of the article can be useful in the preparation of educational literature, as well as in the practical activities of state structures implementing the policy in the spiritual sphere.

AB A special place in the spiritual heritage of the Tatar people belongs to the historical thought of the late XIX - early XX centuries. Tatar historians achieved significant results in the reconstruction and study of the national past in a short time. However, there is no works "where the formation and development of the Tatar historical science of the late XIX-early XX centuries would be considered specially". Systematized study of the historical thought of the Tatars of the period of Jadidism, the identification of features, trends, directions of its development remains an actual task of modern science. This paper is aimed at investigating the specific features of the spiritual and social and political development of the Tatar people at the end of the XIX - beginning of the XX centuries. The leading method for the investigation of this problem is the comparative-historical one, which includes historical comparisons, and also gives the opportunity to study both historiographic facts relating to a particular historical situation and the phenomena of historiography in their qualitative change, contributing to the elucidation of the laws of the development of historical thought. The main results: the development of the historical thought of the Tatar intelligentsia during the period of Jadidism was generalized for the first time, the features of the development of historical knowledge and the formation of the foundations of historical science in the Tatars at the end of the XIX -beginning of the XX centuries were singled out, its main directions were identified, their problems and development tendencies were shown. Bringing around a wide range of sources and taking into account the estimates existing in the literature, the authors attempted to conduct integrated study and analysis of the discussions on the ethnonym and ethnic self-identification that played an important role in the formation of the historical and national identity of the Tatars.

DE Labour Party; elections; electoral support; parliament; trade unions
AB The first half of the XX century was marked by the rapid development of the Labour parties, not only in Europe but all over the world. Established by trade unions to ensure representation of the interests of employees in legislative bodies, they have become key political institutions in a number of Western countries. However, in recent years the global trend towards weakening the level of electoral support for the Labour parties can be noticed. So, since 2010 they have not been able to win the majority of seats in the House of Commons of Great Britain. In Australia, the Labour Party has been in opposition since 2013, and in New Zealand - since 2008. In 2017 Netherland's parliamentary elections ended with a devastating defeat of the Labour Party. In Norway, a similar party lost the parliamentary majority in 2013. The sustainability of this trend allows to suggest the hypothesis about the global crisis of Labour parties, which is likely to continue in the near future.
   The article is an attempt to find the causes of the above-mentioned crisis. According to the authors, the first reason is the evolution of the Western model of material production. The decline of employment in the industrial sector, the reduction of the number of working class members, as well as the harmonization of labor-capital relations cause the situation, when voters don't need parties which represent labor's interests any more. The second reason is connected with the weakening of the western trade unions, which have always been the main sources of financial support and the most important strategic partners for Labour parties. The third problem is the discrepancy between the Left Labour ideology and the modern challenges facing Western civilization. In particular, the Labour party took quite a soft position on the immigration crisis and the terrorist threat hanging over many European countries. In addition, modern programs and slogans of Labour, always distinguished by a certain degree of populism, can no longer find the same response from the pragmatical Western voters. Finally, the fourth factor of weakening of the electoral support of Labour parties can be the lack of charismatic political leaders ready to take the lead of the labor movement at the world and national levels. The authors of the article believe that at the moment there are no strong reasons to believe that the problem of low political support of Labour parties will be overcome.

DE phenomenal mental and psychological mental; supervenience; qualia
AB Philosophy of mind is of the most significant branches in contemporary analytic philosophy. The problem field of analytic philosophy of mind covers a variety of issues which are related to the essence, origin and functions of consciousness. Expansion of mental duality concept is also connected with this branch of philosophy. The essence of this concept lies in dividing mental on the phenomenal and psychological mental. The first is a kind of consciously experienced state, the consciousness "in the first person"; the second is the explanatory basis of behavior, consciousness "in the third person." In turn, the phenomenal consciousness can be a qualitative or subjective. Phenomenal mental may have, in turn, a qualitative or subjective character.
   Taking the idea that the term "consciousness" has two important sense, it is possible to clarify the main issues that arise in this subject area. First of all we are talking about the nature of consciousness. Confusing of the two aspects of mental entails a lot of contradictions: in most cases, the researching object is replaced with a narrower concept of "psychological mental" or "phenomenal mental".
   The issue of psychological nature of consciousness lies at the intersection of neuroscience and philosophy. However, the main difficulty is still in phenomenal mental. Contouring its borders contributes to the gradual resolution of most of the difficulties that arise here.
   It is most likely that the solution to mind-body problem lies in the area that is closely linked with the position that mental naturally but not logically supervenes on physical. That is, for any substance in our world the special structure of neurons which is exist in his body entails the existence of consciousness. However, this assertion doesn't mean that the consciousness has physical nature, it is only shows that the foundation of mental experience is a complex set of neural networks, which is present in our body. On the other hand, such a statement makes it possible reductionist explanation of the psychological concept of consciousness, but phenomenal aspects of it are still not amenable to reductionist explanation.
   Thus, the focus of attention of contemporary philosophical research of consciousness needed to replace to the phenomenal aspect. Psychological consciousness must also be neuroscience's subject of study.

DE religion; myth; sacral; transtsendention; metareality; discourse;
   superstition
AB The authors view justification of situation according to which the radical identification or on the contrary opposition of the myth and religion is incorrect is carried out in the article. It is shown that the myth and religion have the general historical prerequisites and therefore they have substantial similarity. So, the myth and religion use figurativeness and metaphoricalness in the course of expression of sense, they contain ideas of sacral and perform similar social functions. Both the religion, and the myth form ideas of metareality which acts as addition and a link of the phenomena of daily reality. But similarity ascertaining does not exclude allocation and essential distinctions.
   Originally the myth and religion represent syncretic unity, but at a certain stage of human evolution will be transformed to the autonomous phenomena capable both to supplement each other, and to be in the denial relation. Their specifics are distinctly shown that they in their own way consider communication between the produced metareality and the daily world, and also they use the special ways of substantial self-expression.
   So, if combination of metareality and the phenomena of actual existence in inseparable unity is characteristic of the myth, then the religion differentiates them in autonomous and in something life forms oppositional to each other. This division is reached because of most expressed ability of religion to a transtsendention which in the myth remains in an undeveloped state. In turn it means that religions from each other as if does not differ, ideas of transcendental sacral are their cornerstone. For the myth existence of this component is optional, but invariable is only a figurative and symbolical way of its substantial self-expression and the embodiment of mythological plots in daily occurrence events. That is why the myth, substituting relationships of cause and effect associative and metaphorical, is present at quality of a source of social manipulations or superstitions in all spheres of public life. In the same cases when the religion incorporates the myth, she subordinates its figurativeness and metaphoricalness to the problems of evident expression of transcendental sacrality, thereby carrying out audit of the myth up to radical change of its initial sense.
   It is possible to draw a conclusion that the myth and religion form rather autonomous phenomena of culture, in some characteristics considerably differing from each other. The evident and figurative picture of the world of mythological consciousness is almost deprived transcendental and, respectively, sacral measurement. On the contrary, the religion designs special area of sacred, transcendental reality, and using for this purpose a discourse of mythology or doing without it.

AB The study is devoted to the formation of Soviet culture and ideological metanarrative in Russia. The inclusion of the anniversary of the two revolutions of 1917 in the social and political discourse testifies to the continuing interest of political elites in the reproduction of memory politics scenarios similar to Soviet commemorative practices. The article describes the mechanisms of the formation of a new ideological and symbolic space of the Soviet state. The key aspects of the construction of Soviet identity and the role of visual and artistic means in the ideological framing and legitimation of political power are revealed. The continuity of Soviet commemorative practices in modern memory politics in Russia is traced. The change in the political regime in Russia is accompanied by the appearance of new Soviet state holidays, which in form resemble the rituals of the old regime. A special role is played by the symbolic means of representation of political power, which reflect the state ideology in the space of mass culture. The celebration of the First of May, the Day of the October Revolution and the Victory Day, along with the introduction of the New Year, mass parades and the Constitution Day, becomes an integral part of the symbolic politics of the Soviet state. Traditional values in new forms of mass education, reflecting Soviet social realities, were maintained in order to save the loyalty to the new "popular" regime. A case of Sevastopol as a discursive platform in which the mythopanorama of the city was realized full of collective memories of the Soviet and imperial periods that supported state identity, is considered. It is concluded, that the actualization of the events of the beginning of the twentieth century in the state holiday discourse contributes to the consolidation of the national community of Russia. The author emphasizes that the appeal of the power elites of modern Russia to the resource of the collective past makes studying the symbolic practices of legitimizing power in the Soviet period urgent.

DE H. Kelsen; Plato; norm; juridical/legal relativism; normative syncretism
AB This research is devoted to the analysis of the juridical relativism and its grounds in H. Kelzen's philosophy of law, presented in A. Didikin's article "Hans Kelzen's Philosophy of Law: relativism and rethinking of causality". H. Kelzen's principle of normativism ("pure theory of law") is analyzed in the context of Plato's "basic principle of legislation" on the basis of normative dogmatism of the latter. The authors came to the conclusion that the principle of legal relativism and principle of normative dogmatism are an essential unity, as norm dogmatism as an essential form structuring social context undergoes constant changes, which are determined by convention.
   In the contemporary philosophy of law the idea of normativism as "pure doctrine of law" (Kelzen) is one of the acute and demanded in connection with the problem of interaction of following the rule and norm interpretation. H. Kelzen's principle of relativism can be considered as one of the possible variants of Plato's normative dogmatism, which is apparently based on the principle of normative syncretism. That is why, H/Kelsen refers accidents, misfortunes, fate, chance to principle of causality. Hence, normative syncretism is a state of Subject's legal consciousness, which preceded segregation of principle of causality, which determined eligibility both of legal relativism and of normative dogmatism conditioned by norm archetype: there must be that (it is not important what) what is appropriate.
   Also, the authors formulate and prove the supposition that the dichotomy of being and obligation is the main condition of legal norm existent. Comparing Plato's approach to legislative organization, its role in state's existence and H. Kelsen's conception of legislation the authors analyzed the idea of the international legacy in the context of international war and state's independence.

DE social situation; social tension; protest participation; relative
   deprivation; protest predictors; long- and short-term factors of protest
AB The key characteristics of the social situation in their interconnection with the population's orientations to various forms of protest activity are considered. The empirical base of this paper is the data of the comparative representative studies conducted in Moscow in 2008-2016. Analysis of these data has made it possible to fix negative trends in the development of the social feeling of citizens in recent years. The authors characterize the dynamics of social tension and citizens' attitude to various forms of defending their interests. The use of binary logistic regression makes it possible to build a hierarchy of the social situation's factors that demonstrate the probability of active participation in protest. Such factors include negative phenomena of social life, a critical attitude to the existing political system, and adoption of orientations at participating in a conflict on the side of one's ethnic group. Consideration of the above factors in the practice of social management can minimize the potential of social tension.

DE S.L. Frank; mysticism; sobornost; sociology; philosophy
AB The article considers the social philosophy of S.L. Frank from the point of view of mysticism. The phenomenon of mystical experiences is explored by a wide range of related sciences that in one way or another affect the activities of human consciousness - such sciences as religious studies, sociology, philosophy, linguistics, psychology, neurophysiology, cognitive science. "Mysticism" is that sphere of human life in which we do not find unambiguous definitions of its content, because of this specificity, every researcher of the phenomenon of "mystical" uses that interpretation that seems to him most adequately reflecting the reality of the phenomenon being studied. This reason opens up prospects for an interdisciplinary study of mysticism. A complex phenomenon in mysticism can be identified a number of aspects, one of which - social - and this article is devoted.
   In the social philosophy of S.L. Frank, we discover the doctrine of a certain community "We" as a special form of being, which reveals to us a genuine unity, hiding behind the many private "I". At the same time, the analyzed S.L. Frankly, the importance of the unifying moment in interpersonal interaction, which precedes any single human "I", is revealed in modern sociological and philosophical thought as a constitutive feature of social relations, which allows us to look at the teachings of SL from a new angle. Frank about the conciliarity. On this basis, on the one hand, we can talk about the social dimension of metaphysics, indicating at the same time the ontological devices of the universe (the static aspect of the given, the image of the staircase), and on the other hand, just about the social dimension of the mystical in philosophy. Frank, trying to point to the dynamic aspect (the image of a moving escalator), a person's access to a living reality that can be discovered and experienced by every person as the moment of the true being "We". Thus, the teaching of S.L. Frank about the catholicity as the true structure of society, can be regarded as the teaching of the mystical deep field of human interaction, through which the perspective of the relationship between the Society and the Absolute opens.

DE unification of Germany; new federal states; political culture; electoral
   preferences; populism; euroscepticism; right-wing radicalism
AB In 2008, the EU entered a series of crises, and that was the reason for growth of euroscepticism and right-wing radicalism. The situation in Germany arouses a particular interest. In this country considered to be a leader of the euro-integration, the populists eurosceptic party "Alternative for Germany" has gained a massive support. The demonstrations of right-wing movement PEGIDA in Dresden are raising concerns in society and among political scientists. The ideas of right-wing radicalists und populists are particularly supported in new federal states that used to be a part of the GDR. Thereby, in this article, the author tried to look into the issue of potentially existing differences in political cultures between the eastern and western federal states, and also to investigate in what way such differences can influence the whole situation. Special attention is devoted to differences in attitudes of West and East Germans towards democracy. The greatest fear of political scientists was: will the inclusion of the former part of the GDR have an impact on democratic development in a negative way? The second point examined is political engagement and involvement into a political process. The third one is the differences in electoral preferences. The fourth one is the analysis of the right populism and radicalism spreading due to a number of indexes which revealed a greater support of the right-wing in East Germany. And finally, several conclusions were drawn. The expectations of the Western elite related with a quick transfer of its political culture to the former GDR territory were not satisfied. A nonlinear interaction was set between political cultures of the western and eastern states which includes adaptation of new federal states to the democratic system of West Germany, polarization in perceptions of an ideal democracy model and integration of electoral preferences. Such differences do not raise concerns in a stable period, but in a period of crises, such factors as the lesser support of democracy, a tendency to non-institutional political involvement, high level of protest moods, the lesser involvement into the European integration process promote greater support for populist parties, eurosceptic and right-wing movements. Thereby, this tendency demoralizes the whole situation in the country.

It brought together nearly one hundred scholars from Russia, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union, whose scientific interests spanned various fields of economics, demography, sociology, political sciences, public health, and psychology. The papers, presented at the plenary and parallel sessions, discussed multiple research problems pertaining to labor market and wages, education, retirement, health, ethnicity, migration, and subjective well-being and attitudes. Although an overwhelming majority of the research topics had been recurring themes at the RLMS-HSE events since the inception of the project, the papers did not fail to demonstrate the wealth of opportunities the RLMS-HSE data had to offer. What set this conference apart from previous ones was a pronounced interest in those sections of the RLMS-HSE data that contain detailed information about health. The sessions on this matter included many fruitful discussions concerning objective indicators of health status, a healthy lifestyle, and the use of healthcare services.

AB In the spotlight - The idea of creation ex nihilo, which is a dogmatic thesis of Christianity. The notion of "creaturely nothingness" is analyzed on the basis of a comparison of metaphysical and post-metaphysical discourses. Metaphysical discourse is represented by the doctrine of Sofia Russian philosophers Vl. Soloviev and S. Bulgakov, and a meditation on the nature of the denial of S. L. Frank; post-metaphysical discourse - the concept of differance Jacques Derrida. The goal is to show how the idea of creation ex nihilo provoked new formats of philosophical discourse, and also to trace back the process that occurred in the period of post-metaphysical turn in philosophy: what impact did the critique of classical metaphysics, in particular, the project deconstructivist Jacques Derrida, on ways of thinking about the ideas of creation?
   It is shown that the difficulty of the Christian understanding of "creation" as a concept that it is, marking the creation of the world, itself does not belong to this world. Creation is a trait that separates Creator and creation. On the one hand, belongs to the Creator, but not co-eternal to Him. On the other hand, means the beginning of creation, its cause, but does not belong to the creation as its result. In this problem the interface point between the divine and the creaturely there is opinionto as the doctrine of mediation between Creator and creature. Using the model of pan-EN-theism in the definition of its basic concept "positive unity", Solovyov connects the tradition of pantheism in the understanding of God and the dogma of the Holy Trinity. As a result, Absolute as Neoplatonists, received his dual nature: Absolute, not involved in the world and Absolute, involved in the world. Soloviev defined the second as "first matter", "soul of the world", Sophia - Wisdom of God, which will be the intermediary between the Creator and creation. In this case, it is the perfect essence of creation already contains in Sofia as a certain ideal base of God. Revealed that inappropriate attitude to Solovyov's notion of "denial" has led to charges of pantheism.
   It was also revealed that, despite the efforts of Bulgakov through the idea of creation to give sophiology maximum Christian character, he ultimately dissolves the concept of creation in the divine essence. The solution is found in thinking Frank about antinomical the coincidence of the Creator and the creation. As a result, the reinterpretation of the nature of the meta-logic of negation as a positive ontological structure.
   The result suggested that the heterogeneity created and uncreated aspects of Sofia comes from the impossibility to solve this problem by using the classic metaphysical resource. It is proposed to use post-metaphysical tradition, for example, the understanding of J. Derrida "nothing" as distinguishing beginning.
   On the one hand, this understanding nothing is the image and likeness of the infinite divine performance of denial, creating the world and giving him the freedom of conceptualization. On the other hand, it underlines that the creature exists due to the denial of God-His nature.

DE logic; naturalistic-fallacies-in-ethics; goodness; utility; pleasure
AB For the first time in scientific literature the equivalence of moral goodness, utility and pleasure is derived deductively (formally) from the assumption of a-priori-ness of knowledge which assumption is precisely formulated in artificial language of modal logics. Constructing the formal inference is accomplished within the framework of an axiomatic system of universal philosophical epistemology making a synthesis of a-priori-ism (rationalism) and empiricism. Precise formulation of the used axiom system is submitted and references to the previously published initial options of it are given. In comparison with the previous publications the system of axioms has underwent significant transformations and additions. Concerning the paper under annotation first of all it is relevant to mention the addition of evaluative modalities: "it is useful that q"; "it is pleasant that q"; "it is beautiful that q", where q stands for a proposition. Without deliberate introducing and precise defining the modalities of utility and pleasure it would be impossible to obtain the main result of the paper.
   The paper exploits systematically the artificial languages and conceptual apparatus of contemporary symbolic logics (the classical symbolic logic and the various modal ones). The first previously not published new scientific result is submitting a formal deductive proof of/for the theorem (Ap superset of (Gp <-> Up)) in the mentioned axiomatic epistemology system, where: p stands for a proposition; Ap stands for the modality "person a-priori knows that p"; Gp stands for the modality "it is morally good that p"; Up stands for the modality "it is useful that p"; the artificial symbols superset of and <-> stand for the binary logic operations "implication" and "equivalence", respectively. The second novel result previously not published elsewhere is constructing a formal deductive proof of/for the theorem Ap superset of (Gp <->(sic)p)) in the mentioned axiomatic epistemology system, where (sic)p stands for the modality "it is pleasant that p". The third previously not published new scientific result is submitting a formal deductive proof of/for the theorem (Ap superset of (Up <->(sic)p)) in the mentioned axiomatic epistemology system. Accepting the definitions and formal deductive inferences submitted in this paper means precise axiomatic defining (formal limiting) the scope of relevance of G. Moore's doctrine of the naturalistic fallacies in ethics.

DE Francafrique; frontier; subject; object; colonialism; the Soviet Union
AB 1960-th year became the year of Africa since then, many countries on the continent gained independence. Though it should be noted, that both the former colonizers and the United States sought to have influence in Africa, controlling the most important spheres of life in the new States. France had adopted the doctrine of "Francafrique" (Francafrique). The gist of it was that "leave but stay", that is, to maintain their influence in the former colonies, giving the latter a semblance of independence. In the United States was undertaken in weapons doctrine "new frontier" or "new frontiers". At the heart of it lay the idea that the United States will support the struggle of new States from the remnants of colonialism, but the United States will need to seek further ideological influence on OMONa-structure of the inhabitants of Africa. Was even proclaimed the slogan "Africa for Africans". It should be noted that in the realities of the early 1960s, African States should not be seen merely as a passive object of foreign policy activity of the USA and the former Colo-nization. The African countries, at least, had a choice the choice of an influential ally in this case. Moreover, it could become not only France and the United States and the Soviet Union (by the way, these States re-ry is not exhaustive!). Thus, the subject person regardless of their desire/reluctance had to start to bribe the "object" (how great was that bribery is not so important - the main thing is that instead of unilateral pressure was a bargain!). Note also that in many respects the relationships that had often referred to as the "niokolo-nialism" was supported by a powerful ideological and political growth in new African States (such events always cause a rise in the humanitarian sphere). In the first years of independence began asset-but to develop the idea of pan-African unity, and the concept of African-sky socialism, and negritude.

AB The paper is devoted to the general problems of development of the North Caucasus region and various aspects of its investigation. This theme was not easy for scientists and analysts at all times, and it cannot be understood in a one-dimensional measurement. In general the Caucasus has provided and continues to exert considerable influence on the formation and development of the Russian identity and this is both theoretical and practical importance for us. Therefore much attention is paid to the present situation in Russian society, its ability to meet the challenges of the times in a rapidly changing world and changes in domestic and foreign policy on its southern borders. The paper presents different approaches to analysis and different comments on them. But all Russian researchers are united in one thing - in the understanding and preservation of this unique region as an integral part of the Russian state and Russian identity.

DE Baikal region; Mongolia; China; cooperation; social concerns of the
   local population
AB This paper examines the problems of interaction of the subjects of the Baikal region with Mongolia and China in a new geopolitical situation. The analysis is based on the results of a sociological survey carried out in 2015-2016 in Irkutsk Oblast, Republic of Buryatia and Zabaikalsky Krai (questionnaire survey, in-depth interviews and focus-group discussions). Social consequences of interaction, concerns and motivation of the local population in collaborating, addressing the social problems of the region have been analyzed. The author has come to a conclusion about positive prospects of further interaction. The paper exposes cooperation constraints, such as statutory and regulatory factors (shortcomings in the Russian border legislation, including the absence of a federal bill on borderland territories), infrastructural constraints (failure to meet international standards of transport, customs and border infrastructure, unpreparedness to host large numbers of tourists), strategic factors (domination of trade and economic direction of cooperation, emphasis of international trade on raw materials), and budgetary constraints (insufficient federal funding by the federal center of the internal development and addressing of social problems of the local population of the subjects of the Baikal region). It exposes concerns associated with negative consequences of cooperation, such as prospects of HPP construction on a tributary of the Selenga in Mongolia and development of tourism on the shore of Lake Baikal threatening the environmental state of the unique lake, long-term lease of lands to foreign citizens, failure to comply with the environmental norms in forestry and agriculture, increase of migration flows to the transboundary areas of the Baikal region. The author concludes that actions should be taken in order to increase the motivation of the local population in cooperation with the neighboring countries, such as the increasing the living standards in the region, creating preferential conditions for the development of entrepreneurship and business in the borderland regions, building up social sphere and infrastructure, equipping customs stations.

The author observes different kinds of political mind during the revolution and activity of different groups of people in revolution events. The main role in arranging and strengthening the local revolutionary organizations played the party leaders of the central party organizations who visited provinces for a special purpose or transiently during the transit under the police supervision. But sometimes it was hard for them to rule the masses because of their political unconsciousness.

DE Hume's Guillotine; performative; competence of participants; practical
   syllogism; skepticism
AB The article views the Max Black's solution of the Hume's philosophical problem (Hume's Guillotine) by using the performative conclusion. Max Black tries to show that performative conclusion can help to provide the transition from factual "is" statements to "ought" statements. The article discusses the contradictions of such solution which does not allow to consider it sufficient. M. Black claims that transition from the "is" statements to "ought" statements is possible. Such transition is possible only in performative aspect.
   Our purpose is demonstration of the fact that this way of the decision is not satisfactory. There are following contradictions which don't allow to reconcile a performative and logical implication. First, from the factual statements can follow anything. Because, the "normal" context is defined by a regularity and success of last cases. Second, the validity of the actual conditions is defined by characters and their competences of the matter. Thus, it is possible to visualize two interconnected problems: the problem of validity of performative statement and problem of the competences of the characters. This problems don't allow to overcome a gap between "is" and "should". From the point of view that the language is a practical activity M. Black's approach has obvious advantages, but at the same time doesn't resolve an issue as "performatives" can be statements of obligation.

DE medical students; the profession of a doctor; labor motivation; social
   status; expectations of medical students
AB The article analyzes the social and individual characteristics of medical students from different regions of Russia, which have the greatest impact on their professional socialization. The motives of the choice of the profession of students of medical schools are considered, which as the main indicate: prestige, the social status of the medical profession in society; Interest in work; Desire to help people; family traditions. The choice of the learner depends on his empirical experience. If, before entering the university, young people choose a medical specialty for their studies according to their own ideas about the profession, then in the process of studying at the university, serious changes occur in the university towards a more rational interpretation of the profession. At the heart of the professional motives of medical students are such markers as prestige, the social status of the doctor (medical worker) in society; Creative and interesting work; Desire to help people; Family traditions (dynasty) of the profession of a doctor. The example of professional activity of parents -medical workers, has a significant impact on the choice of specialty for teaching and vocational guidance among students studying in medical specialties in medical educational organizations. In conclusion, the author concludes that young people choose to study medical specialty in terms of romantic ideas ("creative and interesting work", "childhood dream"). However, in the process of training in a medical educational organization, as you grow up, a reassessment of values takes place. Young specialists expect the future work place to present an interesting activity in the field of high-tech medicine, the opportunity to gain experience and professionalism, a high level of income and the status of the profession. As far as professionalisation, the hope for the opportunity to get all graduates into modern, equipped organizations goes. Some students of medical schools and colleges come to the realization that the level of income will not satisfy the needs, correspond to the complexity and responsibility of the work. Therefore, in the current conditions of shortage of personnel in healthcare, it is extremely important to support the professional orientation of students and young professionals, taking into account their individual needs and expectations from work.

DE social network analysis; social topology; space and topology tools
AB The paper focuses on bringing to light the foundations and mechanisms of applying social topology of space to studying such a direction of the network theory as the social network analysis.
   Giving pride of place to the configuration of locations of social objects in real and symbolic space, the space branch of social topology appears to be very close to SNA tasks aiming at the construction and subsequent study of network structures.
   The author claims that understanding the ontology of network objects as relationships between actors formed within the framework of the social network analysis implicitly contains the prerequisites for applying the principles of social topology.
   Meanwhile, the theory and practice of modeling the structures of social networks prove the application of topological tools as a representational device rather than an effective analytical lens. The main reason for involving the topology of space in this way is the obvious self-sustainability of a specially developed set of analytical tools allowing the study of network objects in the context of SNA interests.
   Nevertheless, it should be noted that even such optional use of space topology potential enables the researchers to find possible solutions to some key issues.
   This article reveals the sufficient theoretical limitations of the network analysis and its spatial topological vector by means of a thorough review of the main critical arguments put forward by sociologists and addressed to SNA supporters.
   Above all, these limitations are related to the statics of the constructs developed that fail to demonstrate the dynamics and semantic completeness of human links.
   The above mentioned theoretical inadequacy is thought of as one of the reasons for a peculiar split of network theory and stimulating its further development in alternative directions.

The total number of repondents was 112. Students expressed their attitude to the October Revolution of 1917. Students form the age group of young people that actively shapes their social identity through emotional identification with prominent figures. They develop their system of values by choosing certain referential models and behavioral patterns. This is the generation that was brought up and got their social experience in a contradictory ideological and political atmosphere. However, their answers have shown that the majority of them (not without some hesitation) share such priorities as strong statesmen and strong state power, protections of people's interests, patriotism and recognition of the continual historical process.

TI BUDDHISM AND SOVIET IDENTITY IN BURYATIA IN 1920S-1930S
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Buryats; soviet ideology; Buddhism; renovationism; political identity;
   ethnic culture; tradition; functions of religion
AB The paper discusses the problem of constructing the policy of the Soviet state to the Buddhist religion in Buryatia in the context of ideological struggle for the creation of a 'new person'. The initially tolerant attitude to Buddhism as a religion of the oppressed ethnic minority in the mid-1920s changed to a repressive policy towards the bastion of class enemies. Basing on the original documents, the author argues that the general atmosphere of intolerance of the Soviet power to religion as a worldview was supplemented with the desire to homogenize the non-Russians with the ethnic majority that would provide a common view on patriotism and loyalty. Soviet authorities understood Buddhism as the basis of an alien worldview and simultaneously as an important element of the conservative ethnic tradition, which was the most opposed to soviet values. In this sense, it was religion that promoted sustainability of ethnic cosmology with its ideas about space, justice and morality. Soviet authorities were fully aware of how strongly the Buddhist mentality ingrained in the Buryat public consciousness. Such an ideological opponent as Buddhism could be suppressed in several ways. The first way implied discrediting religion and clergy, destruction of temples and bringing the monks-lamas beyond public and family activities. The second way meant the complete destruction of the Buddhist worldview, its ethics and conceptual apparatus. In the case of the young generation, the ideological victory could be attained by means of what is perhaps more important: everything associated with Buddhism was declared old, outdated and backward. Socially approved behavior meant a purely materialistic worldview. In addition, an important place was given to people's concerns to be suspected of religious faith as this could lead to the most tragic consequences. Destroying the tradition, the communist authorities aimed at a complete change in the cosmological ideas about the world order. Besides, Soviet identity meant both atheisation of the public consciousness and replacement of the traditional language by the Soviet one with its specific ideological lexical units (materialism, atheism, revolution and counterrevolution, class enemy and others). Channeled through the media and artistic sphere, socio-political discourse successfully exercised the function of education in the communist spirit, condemning and bringing the concepts of traditional culture related to Buddhism beyond the limits of the socially approved language.

SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL

DT Article
DE February Revolution; interactive rituals; legitimacy; attitudes of
   consciousness and behavior; operant conditioning; social conflict;
   political violence
AB The concept of conflict dynamics during periods of deep social and political crises and social revolutions is presented. The concept integrates the theory of interactive rituals (E. Durkheim, E. Goffman, R. Collins), the theory of attitudes (Dm. Uznadze) and habitus (P. Bourdieu), the operant conditioning model (B. Skinner), a new typology of legitimacy, principles of legitimacy dynamics, change of interaction fields, factors of resoluteness to use violence, etc. The "chaos" of revolutionary events is interpreted as a complex, polyvariant conflict dynamics with intermittent periods relative to regular processes ("funnel" or "track", "rut") and brief periods of bifurcation with several opening alternatives ("fork"). In successful interactive rituals, participants begin to experience a common emotion and acquire a common subjective reality. The stronger this general emotion is, the more effectively the five types of attitudes are strengthened or transformed: cognitive attitudes (frames), existential attitudes (identities), symbolic attitudes (sacred objects, values), social attitudes (roles), behavioral attitudes (typical reactions, practices). Aggressive conflicts with escalation are treated as a combination of attempts by each side to impose its ritual: to stand in the winner position and to drive an enemy into the defeated position. The attitudes in the rituals are actualized, strengthened or become latent, destroyed depending on the positive or negative reinforcement: the sense of winning, victory or frustration of loss, defeat. The special role of violence in the revolutionary periods is due to the weakening of conventional institutions and practices that exclude or severely restrict violence. The author uses the but a new typology of legitimacy, rather that the classical Weberian one, which includes division according to the subjects of recognition: forceful legitimacy, authoritative legitimacy, popular legitimacy, international legitimacy. In revolutionary periods, the state loses its monopoly on legitimate violence, and therefore there appears a paramilitarian legitimacy that political actors possess from all sorts of militant groups and gangs. In the revolutionary period, decisive is not a single encounter, but the whole cascade of multiple and interconnected chains of events. The main results of these events are shifts in the legitimacy of the parties, in access to administrative and forceful resources. On this basis, a theoretical analysis of the well-known events of the February Revolution of 1917 was carried out: the increase in the mass character of insurgents, despite attempts of forceful suppression, the transfer of Petrograd garrison to the Revolutionary side, the dissolution of the Council of Ministers and factual support of rebels by the Duma, the rejection of the punitive march, the abdication of Nicholas II.

AB The article discusses the axiological foundations of family policy in contemporary Western societies. The analysis is carried out within the framework of a welfare state ideology and current transformations of family and gender relations. The authors consider traditional and modern approaches to the family and gender diversity of modern societies which has become one of the central issues of the socio-humanitarian discourse. Family relations and family policy are among those social institutions that have distinct axiological characteristics. Axiology forms a set of goals, methods, and mechanisms for the reproduction of family relations. Reflections on the axiological parameters of modern family relations penetrate into the public debate. The issues highly discussed are the modernization of a family, its changing gender and demographic characteristics, its impact on the development of national economies. Radical social, economic and technological transformations of modern societies affect the nature of family and gender relations. Traditional wedlock is no longer the only legitimate institution that has the power to control sexuality, reproduction and gender identification. New patterns of marriage and family relations emerge. The family structure becomes more heterogeneous and often includes not only family ties, but also employees, friends and virtual communities. Different types of care, support and resource exchange within the extended family networks are formed. They perform complementary and substitutive functions for inefficient state and social institutions. The research question is: How do the axiological foundations of family and gender relations in modern societies transform? The methodology of the research is an interdisciplinary approach to the family, which unites the knowledge from philosophy, sociology, culture studies, political science, economics and demography. The authors convincingly show that, despite the significant transformations of a family, it remains an exclusive institution that performs the basic socio-cultural functions, mainly reproductive, existential, socializing. The elimination of tensions and contradictions caused by axiological transformations of modern social reality is possible by means of the implementation of a gender-balanced family policy. The authorities need to create the most favorable environment for families, which enables working parents to combine professional and family duties. This requires the combination of efforts and resources of the state, the market and the family.

Information asymmetry is regarded not only as the information field with a conscious moral deviations, but also as a mechanism of social control. The relevance of this article is not in doubt, since communication plays a huge role in shaping public consciousness. The author of a major operation by the definition of the role of communication in the process of acculturation. Apply theoretical knowledge of foreign authors of the second half of the XX century and their view of popular culture from the perspective of "sociodynamics culture", "diffusion theory", as well as the submission of the supporters of active and personalistic approaches. It is also important that the R.V. Alekseev writes about collective behavior and social control as "matter" and "form", thereby referring to the materialist philosophical tradition. Just shows a comparison of modern communication model with the information field of the Soviet past. In conclusion, the author concludes that the communication message is the language model of information transfer with its stereotypical subjects, it contributes to the daily handling of collective behavior.

DE boyhood; archetypes; archetypes-images and archetypes-themes of Central
   Africa; children's military education
AB The basic archetype of boyhood in Kongo is "warrior", which has been predetermined by the historical background, modern political situation and at the same time by the significant disbalance of population with the number of women being notably larger, which intensifies typical manifestations of the archetype in the range of requirements for every individual male. This gender preponderance was caused by permanent local conflicts, the last of which was the war of 1997-1997. Like in any militarized society, among the leading archetypes of boyhood in Kongo we can distinguish "warrior", "hero", "hunter", which is reflected in fairy tales and myths of Central Africa, such as the story of a boy born with weapons in his hands and singing a battle song. Since early childhood the traits of a future man are formed in Kongolese boys: perseverance and endurance, survival skills, independence, reticence and a military role model in mind. The boys normally take part in militarized games with distributed roles (soldier, scout, field engineer), in law enforcement games where they are police officers or gangsters and other team games where they use handmade weapons. In a protracted military conflict, state-commissioned preparation of a "universal soldier"begins in the system of children's military education. Boys at the age of 12 enter General Leclerc School (Brazzaville) after passing through a severe competition with 1000 candidates for each place. There they study until they turn 18 and get a degree in science or arts. At the end of their education they are expected to take a most difficult complex examination for survival in the conditions of military training in the wild. The society encourages the ambition of boys to get a military profession. When in a military school the boys are on full pay and receive a scholarship. The best students receive valuable gifts, including cars and tours to France. An officer in the family means stability in the present and future, protection and a higher social status.

DE communicative space; masculinity; educational process; socialization
AB This article discusses the main problems of communicative space formation in the modern Russian school, in the absence of what it is impossible to achieve understanding, recognition and trust the most important conditions for productive and harmonious development of students. The results of many studies demonstrate that in the educational environment there is a spread of indifference, lack of initiative, lack of self-criticism and personal interest in high educational results, tendency to alienation from the traditional values of the school environment, loss of interest in his work. Despite of stated government priority role of the education system, in the modern school the quality of education continues to fall, what inevitably leads to a further decline in the prestige of the teacher profession, growing discontent of parents and society. The article highlights the main problems hindering the formation of communicative space: the low prestige of teachers from the perspective of students and their parents, the increase of workload and the administrative pressure on teachers, trends of mutual shifting of responsibility for the upbringing work of the younger generation ( parents believe that it is the duty of teachers, and vice versa), apathy and indifference to the school activities and any practices, instrumental attitude towards the teaching process, the prevalence of social apathy among teachers, as well as the predominance among teachers the negative stereotypes of students. The article shows that the absence of a trusting, personal relationship between student and teacher leads to an increase in the number of ontologically insecure, scattered individuals, with weak gender or another identity. To a greater extent this applies to boys/men who think about the process of education increasingly instrumental than girls, and are in the educational process where there is implicit or explicit feminization. The paper shows possible ways of practical actions aimed at the formation of communicative space in the school, the approaches to masculinity, which as an example illustrates the relevance of the consent discourse".

In all these conferences, a common theme was the post- Soviet space. At the same time, each of the conferences was devoted to the consideration of its various aspects. The author pays special attention to the 5th International Conference on the Study of the Post-Soviet Space Russia-Neighborhood-EU, held in Torun, Poland, on October 19-20,2016. This conference was primarily devoted to the analysis of Russia's policy towards "neara broad", and also Interests of the European Union in this region. The focus of this conference was not only an analysis of the problem areas of rivalry between Russia and the European Union in the post-Soviet space, but also opening a discussion on the prospects for the development of the post- Soviet space. In the light of the current processes in Ukraine, the participants of the conference were involved in the discussion of such issues as, for example: Is the thesis on reducing Russian influence in the post-Soviet space still relevant? What tools will Russia use to maintain its dominant position in this region? Is the EU ready to make an attempt to compete with Russia for influence in this region? What can be the reaction of the post- Soviet countries about the growing rivalry of international actors in their territory? Is it possible in the future to preserve non-aligned states in the post- Soviet space? The author of the article - the repeated participant of the conferences held in Torun, outlines the main problems that were voiced at the conference in Torun in 2016 on the study of the post- Soviet space Russia - near abroad - the EU: political, economic and military rivalry between Russia and the European Union In the post- Soviet space; Ukrainian political issues, including topical issues of internal political issues, economic and energy problems in Ukraine; Efficiency and relevance of Russian integration projects in the post-Soviet space; A comparative analysis of Russian and European Soft Power (soft power) tools, as well as their use in the post- Soviet space; Positional dynamics of post-Soviet countries regarding the objects of rivalry between the European Union and Russia.

DE NBIC-convergence; convergent technologies; human nature; biological
   conservatism; antiessentialism
AB The article considers the problem of human being and latest technologies convergence. There are three its directions: radical bioconservatism; technological radicalism; moderate bioconservatism. The latest one is the methodological basis of the article. To consider the subject of the article it is necessary: 1) to comprehend ontological possibility of convergence in the context of dialogue between essentialism and antiessentialism in philosophical anthropology; 2) to formulate the definition of the concept "human being and latest technologies convergence"; 3) to formulate the understanding of human (in comparison with technological radicalism). The ontological possibility of convergence is determined by openness of human nature which is realized by change of interaction between human being and environment. As convergent technologies are changing this interaction, so the disclosure of unknown sides of human nature is inevitable. In this regard the inefficiency of the opposition of essentialism and antiessentialism is recognized. The concept of "human being and latest technologies convergence" is defined as the conjugation in framework of transformative practices of converging elements while maintaining their quality certainty. The article formulates thesis that expresses the human understanding from the standpoint of moderate bioconservatism: human being as unity of body and soul; human being as integral part of the biosphere; moderately alarmist understanding of engineering and technology value; co-evolution mechanism of human being and the latest technology interaction; human being is transcending concerned being; optimistic understanding of human being. Moderate biological conservatism is considered as kind of scientist anthropology which is alternative to technological radicalism. However, the complex of ponderous ideas allows us to create (or make significant contribution to the creation) of universal doctrine about the person meeting his newly position in the world. The concept of "ecological imperative" (by N.N. Moiseev) is proposed to refer not only to the environment but also to human nature. human being and latest technologies convergence from the standpoint of moderate bioconservatism implies maximum matching of technology to corporeal and rational human nature for its preservation and further development of its capacity.

DE masculinity; asymmetrical structure of parenting; absent father;
   pseudo-mothering
AB According to Nancy Chodorow, boys-specific problems arise because of the asymmetrical structure of parenting. Manifestation of this structure is actively researched concept of the "absent father" which is used to describe not only incomplete families, but those where the self-actualization seeking male is poorly involved in relationship with his children. Researchers conclude that lack of contact between the man and the boy results in identity formation and some relationship establishing difficulties. In the philosophical literature "absent father" is formulated as a manifestation of well-known from the beginning of western culture dualism. Meanwhile, in corresponding contemporary sources position of the phenomenon of "absent father" itself is not found. The development of this problem has been started by N. Chodorow, although features of psychoanalytical discourse and perspective of her work "The Reproduction of Mothering" in general made it impossible to use the researcher's conclusions in a philosophical discussion. That justifies scientific novelty of the approach which is suggested in the present paper: consideration of statistically recorded problems of boys and males in the context of "absent fatherhood vs. pseudo-mothering" opposition. It can be described as lack of parenting vs. overparenting and both alternatives are persistent social norms and considered as such. Becoming of the boy, the formation of his masculinity in such context seems slightly different. Execution of ban on showing "emotions of weakness", some recorded difficulties of boys and males in resolution of conflicts in a peaceful way may be understood not only as an effect of the influence of boys subculture but as a result of the identity formation process. More precisely, not having an access to the father's role model, boy turns to the mother's to invert it. As such role model, pseudo-mothering appears - the social norm of nearly maternal care of woman about persons other than her own children. Pseudo-mothering implies empathy, cooperation, emotional warmness. A boy inverts those attitudes (because of the absence of positive primary model of manliness he is forced to define masculine as opposite to feminine) and implements contradictory attitudes. Thus, "absent fatherhood vs. pseudomothering" is binary opposition and problems of boys and males are provoked not by itself, but as a part of gender attitude of parenting as a whole.

AB In the formation of any group identity is enabled the collective unconscious program, transforming the archetypical image of "I and the World" in the archetypical image of "We and the World". This program, embedded the individual Self in the Self group, we have called the archetype of corporativity. The current globalization process can substantiate the same archetypical programs that worked before. The Western world, as the subject of its globalization project, in full compliance with the archetypical program of corporativity seeks to make its own We-Self in the "universal-all-of-us-Self". If any we-group doesn't fit in all the world's leading standards, it should be "civilize". And as long as it will not be "tightened" to the appropriate standards its members should be regarded still-not-quite-human. Corporativity archetype is involved in any Globalization project, with dialectically contradictory manner. On the one hand, it provides the possibility of its supporters existential experience of belonging to a potentially very powerful universal Self. On the other hand, the program starts the archetypical mechanisms bias - positive to "ours" negative and even hostile to the "others". We can assume that overcoming the contradictions generated by the archetype of corporativity will promote through the popular at the moment project of humanity unification into a single entity in the face of the so-called global threats. However, the implementation of this project is possible only if the imperatives of the universal "we-self" will be stronger than the imperatives of its constituent smaller selves, that would reliably block the work of the archetypical program "ours-others" on the levels of the we-groups included in the humanity. And this is unlikely to happen before a global catastrophe. Anyway, the solution to this problem is impossible without strengthening the cultural and symbolic components in the bundle of collective rational and collective unconscious, which instrumentally is rather formidable task.

AB The political realities of the modern post-bipolar world, many of which have a crisis or conflict potential, such as natural and humanitarian disasters, global security threats, world economic recession, cultural-civilizational and information wars, regional and local conflicts, force the actors to seek new means of maintaining reputation and, consequently, to rethink the meaning of some concepts, one of which is political image. Positive, stable and controlled political image is one of the tools to retain power in the modern world, and is also a source of soft power - power of attraction - for States seeking to improve competitiveness. The article substantiates the necessity of formation of a positive image for political actors wishing to increase the competitiveness on the world stage, aiming to overcome the crisis with minimized reputational and image risks. Scientific novelty of the research lies in the author's determination of concept "crisis image strategy", which is understood as a pattern of actions specifically designed by the actor to manage image and reputation in a crisis. Management means in this case prevention of the destruction of a positive image which experiences negative influence of environmental factors, the establishment of measures for combating manipulation of the image by third parties, the development of preventive measures to minimize image risks, as well as building a base for post-crisis adjustments of the image and creation of a new image paradigm. in the analysis of the key features of the formation of the CIS in all phases of crisis - pre-crisis, crisis, postcrisis - as well as in the formulation of specific recommendations to create a positive image for actor in crisis. The author proposes a draft "road map" for the formation of the foundations of the crisis image strategy and formulates specific recommendations for designing or maintaining a positive image for actor in crisis. The study concludes that States and supranational structures, wishing to maintain its leading position on the world stage, must consider the image strategy and crisis image management as integrative part of their general political course.

DE creation; construction; madeness; wholness; pragmatism; artistic image;

AB The article "The pendulum of understanding of creation" touches the ontologi- metodological basis of the analysis of the world, put forward by Descartes and Kant. With this purpose the phenomenon of constructivizm is examined that can serve as epistemological, artistic and aesthetic reception (constructivizm) and is correlated with other concepts, including the concept of "madeness" that have received a resonance in the artistic quests of Russian writers and painters of the early twentieth century (B.M. Eichenbaum, V.B. Shklovski, P.A. Philonov). It is shown that the concept of "madeness", used by Russian craftsmen was intended to demonstrate the wholeness of the organic vision of the world as opposed to its mechanistic interpretation. The confrontation of the organic and the mechanistic perception of the world, reflected in the creation of artistic images had their supporters. The semantic meaning of 'madeness' was analyzed on specific examples which used by homeland authors as opposed to the concept of "done" as the manifestation of subject-practical activities of the people who has been removed from the spiritual-holistic vision of the world. The resonances of the positivist style of thinking were marked and served the creation of article by R. Kipling "The man who was" praising the engineering and technical activities of people, as opposed to the spiritual meaning which we find in Russian artistic surroundings. It is shown that a natural extension of the fledgling pragmatism was the formation in Russia bravura aesthetics of the 30-ies, which had, however, alternative positions. It is provided in my work that the origins of the development of the mechanistic vision of the world as a pan-European phenomenon, dating back to the worldviews of the New time, which were the basis of the formation of Western civilization. The article touches the historical-philosophical aspect for research of the ponderously concepts for historical knowledge and theoretical positions. In this regard, the position of J. Vico was reviewed, who admitted as a criterion of the truth of the history reliance on "material created" artifacts, and was continued in the theoretical and methodological researches of the twentieth century. In particular it is the position of F. Boas and B. Malinowski.

AB The article discusses the socialization of boys in orphanages and foster families. In modern Russia most of the orphans are boys-teenagers. Socialization of boys has its own characteristics. They are associated with a high influence of stereotypes on the education of boys: a boy can't be emotional, he's not crying, he must be strong. When a child is left without parents is a big trauma for him. Professionals who work with family and children usually do not take into account the specifics of the sex of the child. Professionals are also influenced by the stereotypical image of "arealman".

In other respects, he developed his own novel line of thought. Also we try to show how can be connected Wittgenstein's turn in philosophy in 1929 with the issue of the Law of Excluded Middle (and with the question of the status of general propositions).

AB Studies of transformation of the political system of People's Republic of China are interest to many scientists in connection with the emerging process of transition a number of countries in the East Asian region to a postindustrial society. Politico- cultural approach to the study of political processes allowed A.V. Vinogradov, Y.M. Berger, V.F. Borodich and other scientists-sialologists determine the degree of influence of traditions on transformation of the political system of the PRC. The political-cultural approach allows to determine the degree of influence of traditions on transformation of the political system of the PRC. With the institutional approach, A.D. Smirnov, V.G. Gelbras, T.S. Choyropov, O.B. Balchindorgievoy used the concepts of governance and power, with the help of which elements of the organizational (institutional) component of the political system were studied. Among Chinese scientists (for example, Xiang Golan, Li Tein, Li Huibing, Li Singang, Bao Xinjiang, Wang Shaoxing), much attention is paid to the institutional approach to studying the transformation processes in the PRC political system. At the heart of the system approach are the ideas about the diverse influence of political, economic, cultural factors of development society, contributing to its integrity. At the heart of the systematic approach of Chinese scientists Yu Keping, Ding Zhuan, Bao Xinjiang, Ding Yuanzhu, there are ideas about the diverse influence of political, economic, cultural factors of the development of society, contributing to its integrity. With the help of sociological approach, A.D. Smirnov and V.F. Borodich analyzed social processes, including the identification of their main subjects, methods and conditions, the emerging political relations between them. Political transformation is understood as a process that is a part of social transformation, a private direction in its development. Among domestic and foreign synologists (for example, V.A. Abramov, N.A. Abramova, V. Mikheyev, Wang Shaosing), a normative value approach has developed in complex studies of transformation processes in the PRC society using other scientific methods. In this scientific article, we will understand the political transformation of the PRC as a kind of social process that involves gradual changes in all or some areas of the political system that are characterized by qualitative or quantitative changes in its structure and relations based on the traditions of Chinese statehood and the mechanisms of political and cultural continuity. Thus, the comprehensive development of China at this time is characterized by us as a stage of structural transformation of society, in which changes in the political system are aimed at strengthening the political order, one of the tasks of which is to achieve stability in the state.

AB Every new book by V.A. Kutyrev is always a significant event in in Russian intellectual life. His works are distinguished by a high alloy of humanism and erudition, lengthy professional criticism, pungent style, all that is needed to make every new book a novelty. Customarily Vladimir warns the reader against degradation in a new, criticizing postmodernism / transmodern and reveals the meaning of history as a human tradition. The end of history is seen more in Parmenides and Kant, that ushered knowledge based understanding of reality. Apart from the tragic dialectic of history, it is proved quite a sensible idea - not everything that is technically possible, should be put into practice. Ethical control must implemented by philosophers, as for atomic bombs and Hadron Collider - they should be displayed as museum exhibits. Kutyrev's philosophy of conservative romantic resistance is simple and elegant - put the life above the quest of meaning. The proclamation of deep ecology as care about the things around us is done in the best traditions of Russian literature and Orthodox Sofia.

DE standard explanatory dictionary; Soviet political discourse; Russian;

AB The paper discusses the reflection of modes of Soviet political discourse in Soviet and post-Soviet Russian, Ukrainian, and Belarusian standard explanatory dictionaries. The authors analyse the dictionary entries representing vocabulary units that have the meanings with modal orientation to the ideological position of the Soviet political discourse. Considering the vector of the Soviet political ideas, the authors used a source list of lexical units with politically conditioned stabilised modal meaning fixed in Russian dictionaries of Soviet and post-Soviet periods. The Soviet and post-Soviet dictionaries of other Slavic languages contain dictionary entries reflecting the meaning of equivalent lexemes and their derivatives with different degree of equivalence (if any). Their content was analyzed considering the specificity of official position of the government in relation to the Soviet political regime. The hypothesis that the political position of a government in relation to the Soviet political regime is reflected in standard explanatory Slavic languages dictionaries has been partially proved. The Slavic language dictionaries of the former USSR republics published in the Soviet times are focused on the reflection of Soviet political discourse modality due to both political unity of the republics and the specificity of lexicographical tradition. The modern change in political attitudes and state status did not result in such far-reaching changes in principles of reflection of Soviet political modality in the Ukrainian Dictionary, as it might have been expected. In the most contemporary Russian language dictionaries the distance representation of the meaning under study is even more active.

AB This work is devoted to the examination and analysis of the family business inheritance phenomenon, its emergence and specific system prevailing in Russia. The focus is made on the review of the most relevant and popular theories and methods used by the authors to study the position of women in the system of small family firms' inheritance, obstacles women face in the process of business transition to the second generation and the role stereotypical traditional Russian brought-up plays in these issues. The article concentrates on the "gender attributes" inequality between male and female heirs both in administration of family firm and in the process of decision-making about the future development of the enterprise. The scheme of family business inheritance in Russia is one of the serious problems linked to both entrepreneurship and aspects related to gender inequality. Several theories can be considered the most relevant and practically used by sociologists and economists in different types of the research. This work analysis such paradigms, as: Systematic theory, which is focused on viewing the world in terms of the interrelationships of objects, such as" family relations" and" firm administration" with one another; so-called Agency theory aimed at examining and analysing the conflicts of interest between the owners and heirs of the previous firm-holders; Stewardship paradygm devoted to the specific combination of pshychological and contecstual fields. Moreover, the article contains overview on the issues, related to the gender disproportion in the system of the small business inheritance in the works of sociologists. The research based on several studies of "gender aspects", as well as inheritance and development of the family business in Russia, can display the increasing role of such issues in the works of sociologists in past decade. It can be also noted that both new areas for study and new types of methods used by the authors are extremely relevant nowadays. Research problems have acquired narrow and more precise focus - from the study of the family business phenomenon in general, to the description of relations between relatives and heirs of the enterprise. However, despite the increased interest of sociologists in these fields, the topic of women's position in the family business is still poorly understood. Further research is highly required on such aspects as the influence of upbringing and stereotypes, the construction of relations between daughters-fathers, as well as gender disproportion in the possibilities of administering their business.

TI GREAT BRITAIN'S WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EU AND THE PROSPECTS OF EUROPEAN
   REGIONAL STRUCTURE STABILITY
SO CONTEMPORARY EUROPE-SOVREMENNAYA EVROPA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE European Union; Great Britain; Brexit; European integration
AB The article deals with the results of the referendum on British exit from the European Union, its implications for the EU and international order. London withdrawal from the European integration project is the culmination of the complex crisis on the European continent. The idea of integration as a constant development towards common good has been challenged. Prior to this, the probability of any state abandon the EU had never been considered. Today the EU faces a threat of Brexit phenomenon spreading across the community. The viability of the European integration project is possible only in case of political and institutional transformation, involving more flexible approaches to goals and formats of integration. However, the partial deconstruction of the integration initiatives and weakened consolidation within the EU makes the group vulnerable in the face of current economic, migration and security challenges. British withdrawal, in addition, changes the structure of European politics, significantly shifting its internal balance of power. It is obvious that Brexit puts a number of hard issues for the European and the international community. The essence of the European policy in the medium term will consist in the pursuit of a new regional balance. Growing centrifugal forces within the European Union reduce the chances of further consolidation within the integration group and generate massive fluctuations inside the system. This makes urgent the search for qualitatively new conceptual design of the European regional structure.

SO CONTEMPORARY EUROPE-SOVREMENNAYA EVROPA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE "Greek disease"; transition societies; NATO; European Union; Greece;
   Montenegro
AB The article addresses a "Greek disease", which is a political economy phenomenon providing a framework for analyzing economic and political processes in transition societies. The authors assume that if external forces procure economic resources and political bonuses for a transition state in the absence of mechanisms for their efficient distribution, such a state is vulnerable for destabilization. To evaluate the resources application efficiency, the authors formulate a range of economic and political criteria based on the post-war Greek history. They show that its consumption-driven economic growth, weak manufacturing sector, and irrational distribution of finances received from abroad have resulted in the Greek inability to overcome the crisis without external support. The authors pay a particular attention to the fact that Greece was accepted into the EEC and NATO for strategic reasons while democratic and market reforms stalled. The revealed patterns are relevant for analyzing the situation not only in Greece, but also in another Balkan country Montenegro, which is comparable to Greece in a number of aspects. The "Greek disease" paradigm allows to predict future economic and political developments in Montenegro, including changes in its foreign policy.

AB The article contains an analysis of social and economic factors, which shape current situation in Germany. The author provides a detailed analysis of problems, which Germany faces. Their scale will only grow. One of the blunders of Germany in its relations with other members of the European Union, is imposition of an economic model, which has proved to harmful - to decrease aggregate demand in the times of crisis. Chancellor A. Merkel committed yet another mistake - she underestimated the role of international migration as a factor of social instability. It led to a partial shift to the Right in domestic politics. An attempt to ban National-Democratic Party, an extremist political force, failed. Sanctions against Russia, which were introduced to a big extent on Berlin's initiative, have also inflicted damage. The article contains interesting demographic comparisons of Germany to other countries.

DT Article
DE Great Patriotic War; Izhevsk; prisoners of war (PoWs); camp; day
   regulations; norms of feeding; antifascist measures
AB The paper describes some aspects of foreign PoWs' stay in Camp 371 in Izhevsk based on archival documents that are first introduced to the academia. The reminiscences of eye-witnesses are used for the research of the little known historical issue of Izhevsk and Udmurtia. The author enumerates the methods of antifascist measures in the camp. Some features of relations of the local population and PoWs are revealed. The paper contains opinions of PoWs disclosing their attitude to Izhevsk and the USSR. It discusses the issue of the food supply of PoWs in Camp 371. Their leisure is described: it consisted in visiting circles on different subjects, reading books and newspapers in their native language, watching movies, participating in sports competitions and even going on excursions in Izhevsk. The paper analyzes the negative features in the everyday life of foreign PoWs in Camp 371. The biggest problem of former soldiers and officers of Hitler's military alliance was petty thefts. The PoWs often stole different things from each other. They had a low level of mutual understanding and collectivism and tried to suffer the difficulties of captivity alone, sometimes with a damage to other PoWs. The former soldiers and officers of Hitler's military alliance who lived and worked in Izhevsk got hot food three times a day, received wages, had four free days a month and 2-3 hours of leisure a day. The duration of the PoWs' working day in most cases was 8 hours. Many PoWs who stayed in Udmurtia and in the USSR had a permit to move within a populated area without a convoy. With the money earned they bought food and goods at markets and in shops; they often took goods home during repatriation. The cases of PoWs who voluntarily stayed in Udmurtia and started families show the absence of tendencies in the Soviet captivity and the recognition by former PoWs of the truth of men who liberated Europe from fascism. Many decades later, some former representatives of the special contingent recollected years in Udmurtia with a nostalgia because PoW camps had satisfactory conditions for life, leisure and public political activities. The data in the paper show that the everyday life and leisure of foreign PoWs in Camp 371 was busy and diverse. The research assists in the elimination of the ample "gap" in the regional and Soviet history.

DE China; Rule of Law; Soviet Union
AB Maintaining stability of the constitutional order often requires political and legal reforms. In China, due to some historical and ideological reasons legal reforms under the guideline "Governing the Country According to Law" became an alternative to political reform. Adhering to the leadership of the China's Communist Party is a significant part in this concept. The problem of the role of ruling party in one-party "rule of law" system is so specific that the CPC has only one predecessor on this path the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. However, by treating the party leadership as the core concept of value CPC will put itself in a vulnerable position if the reform fails. The study focuses on a specific problem of the role of ruling party in one-party "rule of law" system in China and its origins from the Soviet Union model. In Part 2 of this article, we discuss contemporary Chinese ideology of "governing the country according to law." Part 3 outlines the Soviet experience of building "socialist rule of law state" in 1987-1991. In Part 4, the relationships between CPC and Chinese method of rule of law are discussed. Finally, the concluding part provides a summary of observations.

TI BUREAUCRACY AT FRONTIER: THE PROBLEM OF REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS
   EFFECTIVENESS IN SINO-RUSSIAN RELATIONS
SO ZHURNAL FRONTIRNYKH ISSLEDOVANII-JOURNAL OF FRONTIER STUDIES
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Russia; China; borderlands; frontier; bureaucracy
AB Modern theories of globalization provide an idea of borderlands as a place where cultural and political spaces "blend". The majority of relevant concepts are based on the studies of the USA-Mexico border. However an interaction between Russian and Chinese border areas demonstrates a different example that contradicts the aforementioned theories. Despite a considerable length of common border and a long history of cross border contacts the phenomenon of cultural and political "melting" is not typical here. The article deals with the problem of local governments' activity in cross-border area of Russia and China, which is the mainstream of Sino-Russian regional cooperation. Being under the pressure of political practices in centralized state and motivated to develop mutual activity of subjects with different civilization code, the local bureaucracy tries to coordinate their decisions with the Center at the cost of neglecting trans-border relations. They don't' trust their `partners' and balancing between risks and opportunities they prefer to make accent on risks. It results in both sides not taking into account specific characteristics of their partners, the specifics of communication and business culture, tend to make proposals without considering partners' interests. Thus, the local authorities of both countries exercise their activity with no mutual understanding. This explains the low effectiveness of present Russian-Chinese regional cooperation that doesn't fit the level of 'strategic partnership' between Moscow and Beijing.

AB The article analyzes gender features of the parishioners of Evangelical churches in Nizhny Novgorod ("Bible Center "Jesus Embassy", N=213 people, there is 43.2% of men and 56.8% of women), considers religious behavior, attitudes, value preferences and political preferences of women.
   In the socio-demographic portrait of a believer were identified following features: she is Russian married woman, from thirty to thirty-four years old with higher or secondary school education, has one child who joined the organization ten or more years ago, does not complain about health and in spite of this survives in the modern Russian socio-economic conditions.
   Evangelical Protestantism is an attractive alternative for young, educated Russian women. It suits the liberal ideology of the market, which has been propagandized in Russian society in last decades and affords a choice to improve life and realize their own opportunities.
   The predominance of women among the parishioners and presence of them among the many adherents shows that belonging to the movement does not encroach upon interests of women, and provides a high range of activities and changes their marital status.
   In the Russian socio-economic environment personal, family and community discipline of the Pentecostals allows women to survive and solve their personal problems. Promotion of stable relationships, desire to overcome family crises with the vigorous religious activity and mutual support in home groups attracts women and improve their self-esteem.
   Respondents build a social circle with specific outlook and reproduce a stereotypical behavior, which is common for the most women in society. Their context-independent strategy allows to find like-minded people in their religious environment and public continuum. This factor is decisive in the matter of indoctrination.
   The problematic and responsibility as essential characteristics of women of the Evangelical faith, shows that Pentecostalism is spreading around in their own ways. In modern Russian conditions it is possible strategy to increase the number of adepts.

AB The article presents the results of empirical research of factors solidarity participants in social control penal system settles the list of participants of social control under the concept of "control range" and the need to assess, in particular, professional competence of members of social control as a key factor of solidarity. In the center of attention - the study of the mechanisms of establishing an individual connection with the community under the influence of sociocultural nadindividualnyh requirements.
   Analysis of the literature allowed to introduce solidarity as the most dynamic phenomenon due to complex interactions of everyday actors and is the main condition for the stability and reproduction of the social system. The sociological theory of social actor is not equivalent to the individual or entity. It is a set of behavioral strategies, set of values and professional experience (habitus) as a representative of a particular social group. Determination of the position of the actor is determined, firstly, the dominant mode of capital available in his presence, and secondly - a specific gravity of each of all types of capital resources in the agent system. The stability of the high level of solidarity provide social resources, social capital, members of social control, which can be modeled within the parameters of the professional competence of participants of public control. Accordingly, for the construction of a rational structure interaction is important to determine the adequacy and completeness of the resources of the agents in the overall structure of the interactions of social control.
   The article presents the social control technologies using such procedures as the interaction "online-" and "offline contacts", factors of efficiency in the activities of PMCs, indicators of solidarity entities of public control penal system. Developing solidarity in public control will reduce the risk of its inefficiencies.

TI THE HIV EPIDEMIC: A SOCIAL PROBLEM OR A NEW MORAL PANIC? (SOCIOLOGICAL

DE HIV; epidemic; social problem; moral panic; mass media
AB 2016 marked the next phase of the protracted social crisis. Economic instability and tension in the international political arena ensured the maintenance of affective reactions in the social environment, thereby providing opportunities for media controllers to build manipulative schemes. The most widespread form of affective reactions is moral panics.
   In 2016 media controllers made an attempt to construct a moral panic, presenting the problem of HIV spread as an epidemic. Using the tools of symbolization and exaggeration, journalists complicated the phenomenon familiar to the public, interpreting it as a forerunner of a social catastrophe. Thus, the HIV epidemic has become the basis for the production of the second-order moral panic, cultivated on social grounds, prearranged by a prior wave of the events of social reality.
   According to the results of the study it is concluded that there are two media strategies: inspiring moral panic and its containment. The example of constructing a moral panic concerning the HIV epidemic by LIFE has demonstrated the fallacy of the chosen strategy, since due to the lack of media tandem this phenomenon has not caused long-term affective reactions in the social environment. The main federal channels (for example, First Channel) promoted the need for HIV prevention. The rhetoric of regional channels (STRC "Orenburg", TRK "TC-Region") corresponded fully to the strategy of the federal mass media and was focused on the adaptation of HIV-infected people in the society.
   To conclude, the spread of HIV in Russian cities has reached a critical level in 2016 and it has been defined as a real social problem that requires consolidated solutions on the part of the society and the state. The increase of public awareness and knowledge - millions of people across the country get interested in their HIV status (only in the Urals the number of people who tested for HIV has increased by 3%) can be considered as a constructive consequence of this problem coverage by federal and regional mass media.

AB In the article a detailed analysis of the actant-rhizome ontology of B. Latour is performed. Analytical procedures are implemented on the basis of the problem field of relativistic ontologies of Leibniz and Deleuze, which are considered as conceptual premises of actant-rhizome ontology and which allow to explore its basic concepts in terms of relationships, associations and links.
   A historical typology of the problem relativistic field registers is based on a retrospective analysis of its modifications. The typology allows to trace the differences in the principles and laws of its construction and to determine the level at which the actant-rhizome ontology is constituted. Three types of registers are identified: ideal, real and physical.
   The ideal register is referred to the ontology of possible worlds of Leibniz. It is recognized that there are two main principles of its organization. The first one is the principle of pre-established harmony, which sets the ideal system of relations and interactions of the world eventness according to the law of conjunction. The second is the principle of impossibility of infinite set of possible worlds to the only existing real world.
   The real ontological register is represented by Deleuze's philosophy. The organizing principle of this register is described using the positional structure of the Other. This structure serves as a condition for providing real existence of possible worlds, and launching the principle of simultaneous existence of impossible worlds. The disjunction is recognized as the principle of the world synthesis.
   A special ontological region, excluding the structure of the Other and defined as a physical register, is allocated inside the real ontology. The processes of the opening of possible worlds, triggering the procedures of assembling and permanent transformations, as well as the processes of the intensification of the disjunctive syntheses, responsible for the linkages of the power circulating materiality, are described in this register. The actant-rhizome ontology of Latour is constituted at this level. Furthermore, it is here where the ontological and conceptual intersection of the philosophical and sociological discourses of Deleuze and Latour are observed, allowing to apply a philosophical conceptual apparatus of Deleuze to analytics of basic concepts of Latour's actant-rhizome ontology. The main concepts analyzed are the following: social, network, the collective assembly, human and non-human actors, plugins.
   In conclusion, it is noted that the physical register of relativistic ontology, which the actantrhizome ontology belongs to, allows Latour to think of social as a process of re-establishment of links between elements that are not social, and start the process of intense transformations in the areas of living material objectivity.

In particular, the centrality of EEC/EU in the regional integration studies is discussed in categories of uniqueness and universality. The current state of affairs in the EU is explored through the prism of centripetal and centrifugal forces. The attention is paid to the issue of political leadership and changes in configuration of leading actors in light of Brexit. The conclusion is drawn that the depth and complex nature of the EU's malaise change the perception of a "united Europe" as a template for regional integration with universal features.

DE H.L.A. Hart; legal language; legal concepts; ascriptivity
AB The article explores a conception of legal discourse proposed by a British philosopher Herbert Hart in his essay The Ascription of Responsibilities and Rights (1949) and later formed a basis of his project of analytical jurisprudence. Features of legal discourse and complexities of its specification are discussed resting on the philosopher's texts and methodology. A view is warranted according to which in his 1949 essay (as in his 1950s works) Hart doesn't offer and doesn't seek to offer clear criteria for specification of legal discourse. Instead he fixes its certain features that do not fit into a traditional, logical and descriptive, model of language. Hence Hart's conception of legal discourse is primarily a general philosophical criticism and reinterpretation of methods of language analysis through an example of a particular speech practice. In this light the author's idea of ascriptivity is not, and isn't intended to be, a universal criterion for a specification of legal discourse. On one hand, this idea is somewhat obscure, given its ambiguous, semantic-pragmatic, use by the philosopher both as a non-factuality of concepts and as a special speech function of statements. On the other hand, according to Hart, it belongs to different types of discourse which involve "social" or institutional concepts and a normative type of reasoning / speaking (a producing speech acts with a help of rules).

DE W. Dilthey; interpretation; history; hermeneutics; human sciences
AB The art of understanding or hermeneutics has a rich history. For Aristotle hermeneutics is mostly a means of decoding grammatical structures. In the Middle Ages there began a tendency to interpret not only the Bible but secular literature. Hermeneutics gradually acquires the character of universality. In the case of Dilthey it becomes the foundation of the human sciences.
   The emphasis on understanding in the humanities has its own history and its foundation. Initially, it gave priority to the psychological introspection. Whatever negative criticism it was exposed, it started the search for techniques that could provide the humanities with a firm foothold in the scientific world.
   The inability to identify the verification procedures of empathy and the inability of ultimate coincidence between the researcher who reads the text and the historical hero gave Dilthey the idea to rely on the interpretation but not on psychological introspection. The individuals in relation to each other have a certain indissoluble communicative link. It emerges despite national and linguistic differences. The fact that people belong to one type creates a thread of understanding between them. Understanding can be presented within the framework of the interpretation and its various methods.
   The article discusses the hermeneutic method as a basis for Dilthey's historical researches. It is the final point of his quest and has much in common with mentioned above communicative link, thanks to which it is possible to satisfy the interest of knowing human history.

DE power; society; state; conservative liberalism; idealistic historism;

AB The problem of power acquired special urgency at the moment in Russia. That was due to a change of configuration of state power in conditions of world globalization processes and also internal reasons related to the restructuring of the political system in Russia that began in the late twentieth century and continues to this day. It must be emphasized that its liberalization according to the western model that was carried out by the ruling elite in the early nineties of the last century didn't bring the success to the social policy reforms, but only intensified the polarization of political forces in the modern Russia. This circumstance gave rise to the idea of a crisis of the "liberal project" in Russia, the impossibility to implement the ideas of liberalism and where the relationship between the government and the society which, having been developed according to the formula "boundless power and passive people" were not changed over the centuries.
   Recognizing largely validity of such assessments it is worth noting that in the renewal of the Russian state along with assimilation of modern methodologies of power it is necessary to rely on the domestic tradition of liberalism in understanding of political institutions and their practical experience in reorganization of it in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
   Among the nominated options of the reconstruction of the country that time it is necessary to consider the one that was developed by the representativies of the conservative-liberal trend in Russian historiography in the last third of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries which was significantly different from the left-liberal projects in deciding the question about the rate of these reforms, the limits of compromise between society and the government. Conservative liberals regarded the state as the sociocultural phenomenon and considered that in the period of reforming the political system, the society should be actively involved in government, to fight poverty, engaging philanthropy without giving up criticizing the authority. They placed special emphasis on historical science the main task of which was the orientation in politics and education the society in the spirit of respect for the values imposed by people from their past.
   In this case we can say that we are talking about the political culture of interaction between society and government. These ideas are consonant with the modern socio-humanitarian discourse of power, which marked approaches are backbone.

DT Article
DE Scotland; England; Great Britain; idea of Union; unionism; empire;

AB The article considers the development of the unionist ideas in Scotland, and the first attempt to implement the unionist project. The author shows that the idea of the Union, i.e. of unifying Scotland and England, emerged in the first half of the 16th century, despite centuries of bloody military confrontation and long-lasting Anglophobia. At that time, Scottish political and historical writings started mentioning a common destiny, a possible union of the countries enjoying equal rights, or else an island empire. Their authors also pointed out the similarity and affinity between the two nations who should better be referred to as "British". After 1560, the idea of the Union became even more relevant as the country witnessed the Scottish Reformation, which looked up to England and relied on its financial and military aid. However, the leaders of the Reformation rejected England's claims to the dominance in the possible alliance; the word "empire" disappeared from their rhetoric. They advocated an equal union in the form of "the Protestant British monarchy". After Elizabeth Tudor died in 1603 and James VI Stuart inherited the English crown, the prospect of the Union became more feasible. The project of the Union was a significant step towards later unification of Scotland and England.

The author analyses several variants of human learning methodology. The first option is the complex approach proposed by academician I. Frolov. The complex approach contributes to rethink the entire scientific knowledge through the prism of human perspective, gives birth to new problems at the interface of different Sciences. Orientation of science to the man becomes the basis of its humanization.
   The second approach to the study of man, considered in article-synthesis methodologies, including categorical modeling, a systematic approach and hermeneutic procedure. There are two categories that represent the methodological significance. This is a self-identity (harmony human inner world) and self-transcendence (inner activity, reflecting the relationship of man in the world). The second component synthesis methodologies is a system approach, which considers a person in three ways of being: 1) natural creature; 2) substance of cultural-historical; 3) creature eternal, universal. And, finally, the third component is hermeneutic procedures aimed at discovering new meanings of life. The basis of hermeneutical procedures is the art of discovering and taking someone else's identity, which is especially relevant in the postmodern era.
   Of particular interest is a synergistic approach, in particular through the system human system knowledge of the language. Analysis of human interaction and the language allows to take into account both behavior and ambiguous multivariate supercomplex systems is subtle methodological tools.
   Philosophical anthropology is endowed with the Mission of integration, synthesis of knowledge about the person. Dissemination of methodological possibilities of philosophical anthropology in education will lead to understanding what identity we must raise today. Application of spectrum of methodologies, the removal of restrictions on studying in various aspects will help overcome reductionism, fragmentation and embark on the path of wisdom, creativity and humanism.

AB The artificial intelligence interferes the world. In the 90th and the beginning of the 21st century the artificial intelligence achieved the greatest success. Quantity of jobs where people, at a research of other planets, neutralization of a bomb replaces robots, studying of a volcano or just execution of boring housework as the cleaning increases. Computers can execute a number of functions: they can conduct cars and planes, to provide us news, chess of a game and soccer or to compose music. Now many production tasks are executed by industrial robots. It led to reduction of cost of production of various goods, including cars and electronics. The artificial intelligence is successfully applied in the majority of various areas, including medical diagnostics, exchange trade, control of the robot, the legislation, opening and toys. Industrial robots are also used for packing of industrial goods, transportation of goods in warehouses, in hospitals or removal of tiny electronic components with a big accuracy, speed and reliability. Scientists are interested in development of robots, similar to the person. But, whether robots are our best friends, or they are dangerous? It is still difficult to answer this question.
   In the represented article highlights the issue related to artificial intelligence, biosafety nanoindustry and security spheres of modern society. Empirical evidence suggests that scientists need to pay particular attention to the objective difficulties arising in the creation of innovative projects and the use of updated technologies, promoting the development of artificial intelligence systems, design of computer systems capable of solving intellectual challenges, for example in the field of robotics and nano-biotechnology directly related to security sector of society. Artificial intelligence is the result of human activity, ability to think logically, to control their actions, to justify their decisions, he can adjust to changes in conditions. Active use of computer technology, nanobiotechnology, may enable radically change human reflection, change the cultural programs and communication technologies are affecting the characteristics of the individual and existential ambiguity of the existing social relations.

The article discusses the idea of everyday life in the works of Russian and foreign philosophers, in such areas as phenomenology, psychoanalysis, Marxism, neo-Marxism, Annales school, postmodernism and russian philosophical school.
   Based on the foregoing, we can conclude that the structure of daily life is determined by the unique individuality of the person, but the social and material aspects of life define the specific constraints of everyday life, which defines the limits of individualization of everyday life. The reality of daily life there as self-evident and compelling facticity, does not require proof and checks its existence. Daily is part of the social reality defined by the integrity of the spiritual and mental and material, necessary condition of social life that takes place in social space and time in the areas of life, work and leisure through a variety of activities.

AB The author develops the theory of the global culinary space. The sociology of food, eating and culinary is a branch of sociology that is undeveloped, but has been developing very rapidly. In the contemporary age food, eating and culinary are strongly affected by the globalization. It creates the global culinary space, where the culinary traditions of many peoples of the word combine. The important component of the everyday reality of each country of the world is the global cuisine that relies on the achievements of very different national cuisines. The most important places of the global culinary space are the global cities - New York, London, Paris, Tokyo, Beijing, Moscow, Berlin and so on. In each of the global cities, there are a lot of the nets of restaurants of different national cuisines. The density of these nets gives us the opportunity to consider the forcefulness of different national cuisines. According to the empirical analysis of the popularity of different national cuisines can be came to the conclusion that there is a hierarchy of culinary powers. The author divides the existing culinary powers into five groups - the culinary superpowers, the great culinary powers, the middle culinary, the small culinary powers and the tiny culinary powers. The culinary superpowers are Italy, Japan and China; the great culinary powers are the USA and France. India, Spain, Thailand and some other countries are the middle culinary powers, Vietnam, Greece, Turkey and some other countries are the small culinary countries, Russia, Brazil, Morocco and some other countries are the tiny culinary powers. The author proposes the explanation of the existing hierarchy of culinary powers. The differentiation of the environment conditions and the specific patterns of historical development of different societies determine the culinary potential of different national cuisines. The author gives a forecast for the main trends of development of the global culinary space.

DE film studies; ideology; Louis Althusser; marxism; Screen
AB Film Studies as a separate academic discipline with its own degree was established in English-speaking universities only in the second half of the 20th century. The case of Great Britain is specifically interesting because establishment of the discipline here resulted not only in appearance of separate degrees, but in a detailed elaborated theory as well. The theory became a model in other countries. Search for an adequate radical left critical approach led to attempts of applying French cinema theory to American mass culture. From 1971 the initiative was taken by renewed Screen journal. The journal's crew wanted not only to influence on the British educational system, but also to consider cinema as a field where the struggle against bourgeois ideology is possible. The Marxist concept of ideology in Screen theory was responsible for interconnection between viewer's subjectivity and film's textuality. These concepts were brought together in theoretical synthesis by Colin MacCabe, who took Louis Althusser's structural Marxism as the basis. But MacCabe put aside an important Althusserian thesis that ideology hasn't its history and treated cinema as an ideological apparatus specific for capitalism. Thus each film according to Screen theory inherits classical realist text and masks social system's contradictions. The cinematic form celebrates ruler class' point of view as the only one. This approach was classical for some period of time. It allowed to analyze the level of signification but was unable to recognize films' difference on the level of representation.

AB In this article, we examine organizational reactions in the Russian third sector to adoption of the so-called "Foreign Agents" law in July 2012. Within the framework of organizational and resource dependence theories, we analyze state "licensing" policy in relation to civil society organizations and the tightening of regulation in the sector. We propose a typology of NGOs based on resource flows and rules of access, enabling a comparison of the organizational reactions of Russian NGOs to the new regulations. The study is grounded empirically in interviews with 19 representatives of NGOs in nine regions, along with data from internal documents, official statistics, and media reports. Our main argument is informed by the open systems theory of organizations, positing that growing state intervention in the third sector increasingly impacts NGOs' organizational features, regardless of type. The imposition of a listing of organizations "with foreign agent functions" has affected relations between the state, business, and the third sector, limiting access to resources for the latter. Measures like presidential grants and subsidies to compensate for resource shortfalls tend to be conditional, for example, on political loyalty. More generally, these environmental changes have hindered the capacity of third sector organizations to sustain professionalization. However, Russian NGOs have demonstrated considerable resilience in adapting to these changes through diffusion of organizational forms to minimize the costs of new legislation.

DE Orthodox Christian; religiosity; Soviet secular regime; Russia;

AB There is popular a point of view that religiosity of the Orthodox Christians in Russia in the first decades of Soviet power was still at a high level. The most striking evidence of itis consideredthe phenomenon of the new Martyrs and Confessors who suffered for the faith in the years of the persecution.
   The aim of this article is to show that the level of religiosity of the Orthodox population in Russia was low alreadyafter the first 20 years of the Soviet regime, that laid the basis for further secularization of the public and individual consciousness of the Orthodox population of the USSR.
   Due to the fact that in the period from 1917 to 1937 systematic scientific studies of religiosity have not been conducted. Statistical materials of the census of 1937 contain information about the attitude of the Soviet population to religion, as well as data that indirectly indicate the state of Orthodox religiosity (data by gender, age, literacy, family status). The census of 1937 shows that by the end of the first 20 years of the Soviet regime in Russia only older woman living in rural areas were religious.
   According to the publication of Moscow Patriarchate in 2011 in the Russian Orthodox Church canonized by name only 1776 of the new Martyrs and Confessors who suffered for the entire period of Soviet persecution. Statistics about not-canonized new martyrs and Confessors of the Orthodox faith during the persecution ambiguous is doubt. The numbers range from 500 to 750 thousand people in the period from 1917 to 1952. In the database of the St. Tikhon's Orthodox University, developed under the leadership of Emelyanov N.E., currently contains 35 thousand names "for Christ suffered". The ratio of the data, which leads Emelyanov N.E. (in total, approx. 300 thousand for the period 1917-1937) with the statistics of the all-Union census of 1937, shows that out of 41 621 572 Russians who considered themselves as Orthodox, proved their faith through martyrdom of faith 0,72%.
   The statistics available, both directly and indirectly indicate the overall lowest level of religiosity of the Orthodox population of Russia after the first 20 years of the Soviet regime, against which the truly religious person, affirming their deep religiosity martyrdom and witnessing of faith ("the core" of the Orthodox) was approximately 1%. This situation became the basis for the further secularization of public and individual consciousness of citizens of the Soviet Union.

AB The authors of this article respond to V.A. Nekhamkin's call to answer the counterfactual challenge of the past related to the question of surrendering Leningrad in the course of the Great Patriotic War. Refuting numerous pseudoscientific investigations of revisionists of the history of that war, the authors show the misanthropic essence of the Third Reich's plans with respect to the Soviet Union in general and Leningrad in particular and, using the logic of alternative history, analyze, first, possible actions of the military-political leadership of Nazi Germany in a situation similar to the blockade of Leningrad and, second, possible military consequences of the loss of the city on the Neva River. From the point of view of military science and humanitarian considerations, it is proved that the actions of the Soviet command in defending Leningrad were not only right but also that no alternative existed.

DE Dagestan; Kumyks; land reform; protest; ethnic mobilization; interethnic

AB The study analyzes the mobilization tendencies amongst the Kumyk population in Dagestan during the first half of 2017 as a result of land reforms that legalize previously illegal villages formed during resettlements from the mountain highlands to the fertile lowlands, which the Kumyk population considers historically their property. The challenge in regulating the land conflicts stems from the ability of each side to mobilize their co-ethnics, resulting in escalation of the conflict. This work shows that ethnic activists increasingly appealing to the norms of sharia law as an alternative to address the land conflicts, operating under a context in which Russian laws are overwhelmingly ignored. It demonstrates that activists increasingly utilize both Russian legal processes and Islamic norms, establishing agreements that allow rely on religious authorities and community elders. The inability to regulate the land conflicts has served as a reason for the consolidation of the Kumyk activists as representatives of the Kumyk ethnicity. This issue has created socio-political risks that can exacerbate ethnic tensions, specifically between Kumyk and Avars ethnicities in Dagestan. Utilizing content analysis of popular Kumyk social networks and traditional media and internet resources, this research describes the modern protest discourse amidst informal Kumyk leaders in Dagestan where particular attention is paid to the political status of the Kumyk population. Also highlighted in this work is the crisis of trust to government institutions as evident in the ineffectiveness of attempts at dialogue between informal Kumyk leaders and government officials.

DE February revolution; Cabinet of his emperor majesty; Provisional
   government; Cabinet's land tenure; Altai district
AB The article deals with the poorly studied issue on the land property of Nicholas II after his renunciation of throne. The primary attention of historians to political elimination of autocracy sets the purpose to study motives, factors and events associated with the elimination of emperor's land tenure in Russia. By the beginning of 1917 the lands included the Altai and the Nerchinsk districts under the Cabinet of his Emperial Majesty. Cabinet's land tenure was considered to be personal property of the emperor. The authors show that for the first days of work the Provisional government hadn't designated accurately its attitude to the land property of the overthrown emperor. Only on March 7 the Minister of Agriculture was entrusted to establish an order of management and use of the Cabinet's lands. The pressure upon the Provisional government was conditioned by the tense situation developing during the February revolution in the Altai district, the largest possession of the emperor. After overthrow of autocracy the population of the region had initiated mass unauthorized capture of the woods, removal of local officials of the Cabinet in response to former tough policy of the Cabinet. Therefore new local authorities demanded the fastest solution of the question of Cabinet's land tenure from Provisional government. Pressure from the region had influenced the choice of radical fate of Cabinet's land tenure by the government. Lands and incomes of the Cabinet had been announced to be the property of the state. But the resolution of Provisional government turned to be ill-considered. It didn't explain the legal bases of this transfer, the order of use of lands for the population of the region. In the Altai district the resolution of Provisional government led to disorder of a uniform complex of the Cabinet's land. Elimination of the Cabinet property in the region had only strengthened resistance of local officials of the Cabinet and radical moods of the population concerning the former property of the emperor.
   E.V. Demchik analyzed the activities of the Provisional government on the question of land property of the overthrown emperor. P.A. Afanasyev revealed the regional context of the problem and the importance of the adopted government decisions.

AB The contradiction between formal rights and real capabilities of individuals is one of the important factors that increases social inequality. The article attempts to conceptualize the space of political representation that is neutral towards the diversity of people. To solve this problem, A. Aisin refers to the notion of heterotopia as a special type of space, aimed at the reproduction of social practices. The analysis conducted by the author shows that the theory of multitude as a self-organizing community does not contradict the idea of political representation and describes the logic of its spatial organization.

AB The article considers from the perspective of Political Science and Economics the problem of "development traps" - mechanisms that block welfare growth in backward countries and preclude their transition to the category of prosperous states. On the basis of the existing theories such as the "middle income trap", "Malthusian trap" etc., A. Akhremenko, I.Lokshin and Ye.Yureskul offer an integrated approach to solving this problem based on total factor productivity (TFP). With the support of mathematical models and theoretical constructions, they reveal a mechanism of economic growth blocking: the decreasing returns to economic productivity from increasing state potential for violence. The authors empirically test their hypotheses about the relationship between development barriers, political institutions and economic productivity on 149 countries across the time span of 1990-2013.

AB The article studies history of the Crimean Tatars migrations in the 19th - early 20th century based on documents from the Russian State Historical Archive. It strives to identify and introduce into scientific use documentary sources on the subject. The author has studied a considerable portion of documents on the history of the Crimea in the 18th - early 20th century, including materials on the history of local population migrations. The novelty of the work hinges on little-known facts concerning resettlement movement among the Crimean Tatars, revealed by a large-scale analysis of documents from the Russian State Historical Archive. The earliest documents on the subject stored in the archive are from late 18th century. Analysis of archival materials allows to identify causes and consequences of the Crimean Tatars mass emigration from and their remigration to Crimea. Specifically, the article provides data on mass migrations of 1860-1870s, and introduces cases of re-emigration in the second half of the 19th - early 20th century. The article addresses the virtually unstudied issue of emigres' and their descendants' return to the Russian Empire in 1880-1884. The author focuses on documents from the personal provenance archival fonds containing eyewitness accounts of the events. As well as sources on the external migration history, the article reviews archival documents on resettlement of the Crimean Tatars in the inner Russian provinces due to political causes. Analysis of documents from the Russian State Historical Archive demonstrates information value and uniqueness of this primary sources complex. Researching these archival materials and their introduction into scientific use is a desired and promising trend in studying history of the Crimean Tatars migration in the 19th - early 20th century.

DE historiography; history of Siberia; peasant migrations
ID RUSSIA
AB The aim of the paper is to present a comprehensive historiographical analysis of the works of Anglo-American and German authors who studied the history of mass peasant migration to Siberia and Far East during the post-reform era. Since the late XIX century up to the present the Western researchers have shown a great interest in the progress and results of the mass peasant resettlements beyond the Ural. In their numerous publications they used new theoretical and methodological approaches, made some valuable observations and conclusions. However, the majority of their publications have been neglected by the Soviet and contemporary Russian scholars. The present paper is meant to fill this gap, so it has the following tasks: to determine the range of relevant issues addressed by Western researchers; to delineate the main periods in the history of studying the peasant migration to Siberia; to characterize main theoretical and methodological approaches used by Western scholars; to evaluate their contribution to this field of research. The author notes that Anglo- American and German researchers considered the mass peasant migrations along with the construction of Trans-Siberian railroad as significant factors ensuring a stronger Russia's presence in Asia. In their works the agrarian history of Russia and Siberia is analyzed in the global context, while the Russian peasantry's way of life is viewed as part of the global peasant culture. In the late XIX - mid-XX centuries the English-and German-language scholars used an objectivist approach and "universal theories" of colonization (K. Wiedenfeld, W. Klumberg, H.-Y. Seraphim) and modernization (D. Treadgold). They retrieved their data from a limited amount of available sources which was offset partially by the widespread use of the works of pre-revolutionary and Soviet specialists. As the international scientific cooperation increased, Western scholars increasingly used documentary materials from the central and local archives of the USSR and Russia. In the second half of the XX - early XXI centuries one of the main distinguishing features of Siberian studies in the West was an extensive use of the "frontier" theory (D. Treadgold, D. Kazmer, A. Kappeler). A contemporary German researcher E.-M. Stolberg attempted at summarizing various theoretical approaches representing the cultural history of Siberia within the political and socioeconomic frameworks, thus contributing to the development of the "frontier" theory, trans-regional and trans-cultural history. The author comes to conclusion that over the last century Western researchers demonstrated a variety of opinions: from the mostly negative attitudes in the early XX century to the mostly positive ones - in the contemporary historiography. While admitting failures in implementation of some governmental measures and specific situation in Southern and Eastern Siberia or in the Far East, contemporary authors tend to write about the migrations' positive impact on the social and economic development of Asian Russia. Focusing on the specifics of situation in Siberia they often underestimate the results of governmental policy aimed at unification of social groups and creation of a "big Russian nation" in Asia. However some historians (St. Marks, A. Wood and others) urge their colleagues not to exaggerate the success of "modernization" or specifics of the Siberian frontier. Such approach along with the use of a traditional theory of "colonization" resembles evaluations and forecasts made by the researchers at the beginning of the XX century.

AB The results of comparative-historical study of the content of the normative image of childhood that emerged in the Soviet Union and modern Russia are presented. It is established that the beginning of historically inextricably linked process of creating a single standard of childhood began in 1920s. It was the first time in our country when the task of creating a perfect image of childhood, which had to guide the adults responsible for the upbringing of future citizens of a new society, was set. Special attention is paid to such means of mass education and the psychological impact, as a poster, allowing to overcome the limits of the information space, the low level of literacy and social culture of general population. It is emphasized that the analysis of the poster is an important method of research in the framework of the comparative-historical approach based on verbal and nonverbal means of expressiveness. It is shown that the reflection of the ideas of motherhood and childhood in the Soviet poster allows to reconstruct the history of formation of the institutional image of childhood, determined by social, economic and ideological objectives of the Soviet state. Deep political and socio-economic changes that occurred in the country in 1990s, made some adjustments to the institutional image of childhood, freeing it from ideology and suggesting alternative approaches to training and education of children. It is noted that in contemporary Russia once again is growing the trend towards unification of the system of education and the development of guidelines of socially desirable image of childhood, fixed in Federal state education standard.

   of 1917 in Russia; Provisional Government; Orthodoxy
AB For Anton Vladimirovich Kartashev (1875-1960), 1917 was a year of unexpected political rise and tragic fall. Docent of the St. Petersburg Theological Academy, Kartashev became popular in liberal circles as chairman of the Society for Religion and Philosophy; he was appointed an associate (deputy) to the Ober-Procurator of the Holy Synod in March 1917. About the need for consistent implementation of the principle of separation of church and state, Kartashev did see eye to eye with the majority of the Cadet (Constitutional Democratic) Party leaders. He was a supporter of 'symphony' between church and state, restoration of patriarchate and conciliar administration of the church. In summer after joining the Cadet Party, Kartashev became Ober-Procurator, although his functions were soon absorbed by the Ministry of Religious Confessions. As a minister, he welcomed the All-Russian Sobor in August 1917, asserting the need for independent conciliar church in 'friendly cultural cooperation' with rule-of-law state. Kartashev participated in the Moscow State Conference and countenanced the affair of General L. G. Kornilov. In September, Kartashev resigned as minister to protest against the socialist stranglehold in the government. The resignation was not accepted, and at the night of 25 October he was arrested, along with other members of the Provisional Government. Letters published here, are adressed to M. A. Petrunkevich, S. V. Panina, and M. F. Kokoshkina; all written by A. V. Kartashev during his imprisonment in the Peter and Paul Fortress. Correspondence of the ex-Minister contains his assessments of past events and records his moods, born from an eschatological perception of the developments in Russia. In one of his letters, Kartashev explored the issues of human nature and flesh, male and female principles, and conditions for their equality before God; the letter also outlined ways and means of reviving Russia after the revolution.

AB Constructed in the 1960s in a wooded area 30 kilometers outside Novosibirsk, Akademgorodok was created as a landmark of Soviet science and industry. The extensive and sparsely populated area in Siberia contained academic institutions and research-and-development facilities that worked on technologies for both civilian and military purposes. The present research addresses the period when Akademgorodok lost its status as a major hub. This study focuses on the cultural and professional transitions of the former Soviet scientists seeking to adapt to a new political, economic, and cultural context.

AB The article deals with the distinction between state and non-state youth policy. This approach was purposefully selected by the authors as the review of the state youth policy only through the prism of the institutional approach does not allow to understand and to comprehend other mechanisms of its formation, in addition to the ones used by state power institutions. The institutional approach also does not take into account a number of important factors, influencing youth policy formation. The authors show the differences between political-science understanding of public diplomacy and its legal, sociological and historical understanding. The article contains the identification of the nature of public diplomacy, which had emerged as a response to the global challenges and threats, to the formation of a new world order, to the course of intra-political development.
   Globalization has become the main reason for public diplomacy emergence and active development. In the context of this study, public diplomacy is presented as an effective mechanism for the formation of the state youth policy of Russia and Kazakhstan. The authors show the advantages of conceptual and formal plan of public diplomacy in comparison to the official one on the example of youth policy development in the two countries. Public diplomacy appeared from the standpoint of the intra-political influence on the power institutions in the state, and the foreign policy effect in the system of international relations. The authors identify and analyze the geopolitical, historical and cultural factors that serve as preconditions for effective development of public diplomacy in the context of youth policy of Russia and Kazakhstan. The role of youth organizations in the space of the actual policy of the relationship between contemporary countries is defined and illustrated. The article gives the forecast for the development of forms and mechanisms of public diplomacy in the context of the formation of the state youth policy of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Kazakhstan. The study showed that the main tool of non-governmental youth organizations in global youth policy is the formation of international public opinion, and the integration of human resources, as important aspects of the process of development and implementation of youth policy.

AB The article is devoted to the study of the history of Zemstvo institutions of the Ufa province in the period from February to October 1917. The role of zemstvo in the system of local governance, democratization of zemstvo assemblies and councils, as well as the formation of the volost zemstvo are examined. The research urgency is caused by the connection of this topic with the problem of the revolutionary crisis of 1917 in different regions of Russia. It is shown that in the period from February to October zemstvo institutions retained the organizational and managerial functions, but quickly lost their political positions. During this period the main controls were zemstvo council, which coordinated the activities for the reorganization of volost administration and the creation of organs of food with the participation of the population. Zemstvo assemblies felt the pressure of radical parties and representatives of the national movement. Where there were no cohesive groups enfranchised vowels, for example, in Zlatoust uyezd, zemstvo institutions became the spokesmen for farm interests. The democratization of zemstvo institutions and the formation of the volost zemstvo self-government could not prevent the collapse of the former system of management, separate parts of which (the departments of land management, their scientific and practical base) were used in the creation of new organs of power.

DT Article
DE source; newsreel; nationalization; reconstruction; Civil War in Finland
AB 4-year-long history of the Skobelev Committee film department came to an end in 1918, when it was nationalized. The article follows the fate of its last film, "Red Finland," and attempts to restore the original assembling using surviving cadres according to information from written sources. In 1917, after the February Revolution, the Skobelev Committee showed on screen the following films: newsreel "Free Russia," 3 series of "Funeral of the victims of Revolution," "The 1 of May, International day of labour and people's fraternity (Petrograd)," "The 1 of May, International day of labour and people's fraternity in Kronshtadt," "Revolutionary days in Petrograd," "Manifestation of the 18 of June," "Moscow State Conference," and other. On October 12, 1917 by order of the Provisionary Government the Skobelev Committee passed under the Political directorate (PUR) of the War Ministry, which engaged in politico-educational activities. In December 1917, after the October Revolution, the Committee became independent and was renamed Skobelev Enlightenment Committee. From November 1917 to March 1918 it filmed "Peace negotiations in Brest-Litovsk," " Front in the days of peace negotiations" (about Russian and German soldiers fraternizing in the Northern Front), "Opening of the Constituent Assembly," "Closure of the Constituent Assembly," "People's power" (about Constituent Assembly elections), "Red Finland" (about revolution in Finland). In early March 1918 property of the Skobelev Committee Petrograd department was to be evacuated to Moscow; the meeting of the State Commission on Education chaired by N.K. Krupskaya decided to transfer the Committee to the People's Commissariat for Education (Narkompros) and to nationalize its film department (but no other). On April 15, 1918 the Committee was shut down, his assents and funds nationalized. " Red Finland" was the Committee's last film. Future studies of newsreels and documentary films released after 1918 may reveal missing cadres of the " Red Finland." Such research would promote the development of newsreels source study technics.

AB The article considers specific features of the language situation and language policy in New Zealand. The author takes into consideration the social status of English and Maori, draws reader's attention to the state policy of the Ministry of education of New Zealand and the activities of governmental and non-governmental organizations concerning the English language, Maori and the New Zealand Sign Language. The author analyses New Zealand state reforms, aimed at cultivation of the cultural, educational and communicative value of the Maori language and culture. The paper draws attention to the growth of ethnic consciousness of the Maori people, communicative expansion of the Maori language usage in public, political, educational, scientific and cultural spheres of New Zealand. The language situation in New Zealand is unbalanced exoglossic. The most common language in New Zealand is English, and it continues to occupy a prestigious position in all spheres of communication: in politics, economy, education, science, art and culture. The Maori language had a low level of linguistic proficiency: it had no writing system, literary tradition, and technical terminology. New Zealand sign language became an official language of New Zealand eleven years ago. Language policy in this aspect enforces tolerance in New Zealand society.
   New Zealand colleges, universities, and research centers with the cooperation of state organizations, conduct effective work on the revival of the cultural Maori heritage, carry out major socio-cultural activities among New Zealand population, and develop a special method of teaching the Maori language.
   Currently, there is an increase of ethnic identity, expansion of the communicative use of the Maori language in public and political life, education, and mass communications in New Zealand. The prevalence of the Maori language is also seen in educational institutions as a teaching subject. Knowledge of the English language gives Maori an access to higher education, wealth and economic advantage.

AB L. Bliakher in his review of the re-edition of the works by Max Weber, one of the renowned classics of the world sociology, attempts to explicate those new meanings that compilers of the volume and commentators found in the chrestomathy texts. According to the reviewer's assessment, the very composition of the book and the introductory article by A. Filippov set out a new, quite unusual context for comprehending works collected within one volume, demonstrating how purely theoretical tools can be used to analyze current political issues. Thereby the classic's masterpieces are consonant with the tasks that social and political sciences face today, when searching for tools to study an increasingly complex reality is becoming the main intellectual challenge.

AB Online communication platforms have rapidly become a substantial element of e-governance processes in Europe and beyond. Today, research has shown that, in cases of social unrest and/or emergency, political actors responsible for their resolution are able to efficiently use microblogging platforms (including Twitter) to promote the discourse of harmonization. But in today's Russia, where the growth of inter-ethnic conflicts between the resettlers from the post-Soviet South (Central Asia and South Caucasus) and the host communities in cities and towns has coincided with the growth of online communication milieus and their radicalization, political actors as well as NGOs seem to play minor roles in online communication management, including the cases of social unrest. We explore two Twitter discussions on inter-ethnic conflicts in Moscow to describe the presence of political actors, their roles in conflict resolution, and the patterns of expectations of other users towards the politicians. We discover extremely low political participation, as well as the phenomenon of 'radical replacement' of the roles of political emergency managers by nationalist users.

AB The Khoper and Ust-Medveditskiy districts of the upper Don in the revolutionary years 1917-1918 are of great interest from the viewpoint of studying the regional socio-political processes taking place in this region and the role of the local Cossacks in these transformations. These districts, being part of the strategically important Don region, became the object of close attention of all political forces trying to take power in the country at that time. The Provisional Government, the Soviet government, the leaders of the White Movement regarded the Cossacks as a potential military force that could be used in the forthcoming struggle. Social and political mood of the upper Don Cossacks in the years of political shocks (1917-1918) became the subject of study of Soviet historians already in the 1940s. Since that time and for many years, the historiography has affirmed that in the years of revolution shocks the upper Don Cossacks had revolutionary moods and were less susceptible to Whiteguard propaganda in comparison with the lower Don Cossacks. Only in the 1990s a different vision emerged in historiography on the question of the formation the socio-political views of the Cossacks in 1917-1918, and on the dominance of the position of neutrality in the mood of the upper Don Cossacks. The article cites a number of arguments that cause doubt on the established ideological schemes and provide an opportunity, based on declassified materials, to form a new historical view on the question of the involvement of the Cossacks of the upper Don districts in the events taking place in the period 19171918 both in the country and in the Don region particularly.

TI MUNICH CRISIS: BEHIND - THE SCENE HISTORY

LA Russian
DT Article
DE USA; Roosevelt; national interest; Munich collusion; diplomacy; World
   War II
AB The article links the tragic historical past of Czechoslovakia, which paid its price for the rejection of sovereignty as a result of its elite's national policy, with the current political discourse around globalization and national interests, the influence of external forces on the policies of dependent states, and often the negative consequences of this influence.
   Much of today's policies of the leading Western powers, primarily the United States, echo their actions during the preparation and implementation of the Munich conspiracy. Playing on international contradictions while staying aside, turning in a victim to an aggressor, etc. are dangerous policies both in the past and today and lead to serious international consequences for their organizers and inspirers.
   Unlike numerous works on this subject, which have appeared in Russia and abroad, focusing mainly on the activities of European << appeasers >>, the author of the article shows the hidden role of American diplomacy in deciding the fate of Czechoslovakia. The US was headed by President Franklin Roosevelt - an acknowledged master of the game on international controversies, avoiding being on the foreground of world politics on dubious issues.
   To clarify the role of the US in European politics during the Munich crisis, the article draws on original sources from the archive of the American ambassador to the Soviet Union, J. Davis from the Library of Congress.

DT Article
DE Political Islam; global civilizational deformation; Muslim brotherhood;
   Mohamed Morsi; inter-civilizational conflicts; Islamist movements;
   countering Islamism
AB The phenomenon of Islamism is considered in the context of global civilizational processes. Features of political Islam are studied in the context of the conflict between technogeneous and anthropogenic civilizations. It is alleged that such a conflict determines the level of demand of Islamist movements in different historical periods, the basis of the understanding these processes, their prediction and the development of possible tools to correct them. The author notes that the emergence and development of Islam as most of the world's religious movements took place in conditions of political bruises and the search for new ways of development meeting the current challenges. It is shown that this circumstance largely determined both the internal structure of these movements and the principles of their interaction with the external environment. It is proved that the Islamic systems confront the modern (primarily Western) society by seeing the basis of statehood in the spiritual (non-material) traditions. The author believes that political Islam is struggling not just with some isolated phenomena in society, but, in principle, with the structure and values of the modern Western (Anglo-American, Atlantic) civilization.

   opinion; Saint Petersburg
ID ASSIMILATION; MIGRATION; NETWORKS
AB The article explains the sociological theory of immigration risks. Despite the fact that domestic sociology has been recently attracting more attention to the risk theory, risks of migration processes have not yet been properly considered. According to the authors, such a theory must consider social risks for all participants of the migration process: host countries, countries of origin and immigrants. The typological model of immigration risks is based on the theory of integration by H. Esser and F. Heckmann. The model describes how various risks are manifested at the micro, meso and macro level of social reality taking into account the four dimensions of social integration: cultural, structural, interactional and identification. Based on the theoretical model the authors identify several groups of risks for the host population: risks based on local and migrant population interaction at the micro level and perceived risks which can be formed by the media under the influence of certain political forces at the macro level. These risk groups were examined using a telephone survey of public opinion of Saint Petersburg residents (N = 1017). The study shows the importance of a cultural distance between the host community and the migrants manifested in increased attention to the standards and values of the host population, whereas risks associated with the labor market and violent behavior remain at the background of public attention. The authors also note a high level of social risk for the part of the host community involved in daily interaction with migrants. Members of community are scared of being involved in the migration process and try to shield themselves from it - they "ignore" the presence of migrants in their everyday life, "do not get involved" in their work and life focusing only on very general view of events which they are actually part of. According to the authors, analysis of social risks of international immigration should be one of the leading areas in sociology of risk and sociology of migration; moreover, this issue may become an independent area of risk assessment and migration theories.

   Council; multi-polar world system
ID EUROPEAN-UNION
AB Since 1990s the EU has been highly aspirational on its role in human rights promotion on a global scale, which has led to the EU's proactive participation in international organizations. The Union identifies itself as 'global human rights force' but less and less acts in accordance with that identity at the UN HRC. At this intergovernmental body the EU acts as a smoothly coordinated block, which is contested by the other regional and political coalitions of states. The emerged multi-polar world system urges for a less normative analysis of EU human rights promotion.
   The article proposes and applies 4 measurable indicators to assess the EU actorness in human rights promotion: 1) explicitness of references to the UN or global fora in the EU primary law and secondary legislation related to human rights promotion; 2) degree of support/contestation for the EU objectives by other non-EU actors at the HRC; 3) degree of ( in) cohesiveness of EU external representation at the HRC; 4) EU ( in) consistency in formulating priorities and using instruments at the HRC.
   Multi-polar world system questions the EU high aspirations as 'a global force' in human rights promotion. The EU ability to use its instruments in human rights promotion is moderate even despite its enhanced burden sharing among the EU member states, a hybrid system of representation, a vast diplomatic and NGOs' network. 'Big' states still play the leading role in this process. The internal disagreement among the EU member states weakens the EU human rights promotion. The UN HRC structural context limits the EU opportunity to promote human rights, therefore, the EU tries to be less loud and less visible.

AB The article describes the role of the think tank community in shaping the U. S. foreign policy toward Ukraine during Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barak Obama administrations. The research shows that the Ukrainian factor played an important role in American foreign policy since the country's independence. While Ukraine was still a republic within the Soviet Union, think tank scholars and American officials were closely monitoring its internal development, looking for alternative voices among both the opposition and the country's elite. Those efforts have helped to establish the basis for future American policymakers. As the second most important and influential republic in the USSR, Ukraine was seen by all U. S. administrations as an important counterpart to the Russian dominance in the near abroad, regardless of the ruling party. Influential American think tanks and leading experts who helped to make an impact on the Ukrainian political class since the Ronald Reagan era have been shaping the U. S. policy toward Ukraine. The article is focused on the system analysis of ideological stances taken by different groups of American experts, regarding the development of political process in Ukraine in 1990-2010s. While the strategy to bring Ukraine into NATO was the main goal for all of the American administrations during this period, officials alone did not pursue it. Various scholars and experts from leading American think tanks took an active part in preparing various policy ideas and provided their expertise to foreign policy officials. Their motives were both scholarly and ideological, and their ties to administration officials promoted their ideas to senior foreign policy levels. However, they would have never been able to succeed in case they would not find a very receptive Ukrainian administration, inspired by desires to counter Russia's influence. One of the study's objectives was to identify prerequisites for the formation of Washington's position in the Ukrainian crisis. It covers the main international and domestic factors shaping the conceptual agenda of Washington's Ukrainian policy. The article might help those who study American policy toward Ukraine and other republics of the former Soviet Union.

The main purpose of this research is the study of new teaching methods, with due regard to the needs of society and human potential. For this purpose, educational methods of the US and Russia were analyzed and compared, their advantages and disadvantages were estimated, and common trends in the development of education were identified. It is stated that during the formation of innovative methods of education for future generations, it is necessary to take into account ethical standards of each ethnic group, culture and traditions of specific country, as well as psycho-physical standards of students. It is justified that the idea of the creation of unified teaching methods for the entire planet population is impossible due to geographic, ethnic, political, and economic differences of every country. However, according to research results of popular techniques, it is possible to develop a model of the most appropriate educational method for the vast majority of countries with due consideration of constant development of science as the main influence factor on methods of education. It is concluded that the general trends of global education are individualization and humanization. They lead to the formation of flexible, critical, creative and effective thinking of students in terms of variability and uncertainty of social reality.

AB Introduction: the article analyzes the specific features of foreign economic relations in Russia, studies the trends in determining the ways to improve foreign economic legislation that governs these relations under the conditions of rapidly changing political, economic, social and legal processes. Purpose: to make an attempt to solve the scientific problem concerning the development of the modern concept of foreign economic relations in Russia. Achievement of this purpose is of great theoretical significance for science of civil and business law. Methods: the methods used include historical-legal, logical-legal, system-structural, method of interbranch legal researches, system analysis. Results: foreign economic relationship has a unique structural type of legal relationship. It is a complex system consisting of the main synthetic foreign economic relationship with the dynamic structure and accompanying subsidiary relationships that have a direct impact on the dynamics of the main one, with not a single private entity taking part in them. The complicated foreign economic relations must be distinguished from a set of legal relations, groups of legal relations interconnected in a certain way. Two criteria of differentiation can be identified, one of which is the aim of the legal relationship, and the other is a close interconnection and interdependence of relations that make up the complex relationship so that they cannot be separated from each other without detriment to the purpose of the legal relationship. Conclusions: through the example of the dynamics of foreign economic relationship on export of sturgeon caviar, it is shown that this legal relationship is a combination of civil law relations on export of sturgeon caviar and subsidiary public and private law relations, entering into which is mandatory for the exporter and in some cases also for the importer. The civil law relationship cannot be realized without the proper fulfilment of obligations under the subsidiary legal relations. Accordingly, the combination of the considered relations can be regarded as a complex legal relationship, because they are all inextricably linked and united by one goal - to fulfil a foreign economic transaction.

AB The article examines the new U.S. administration's outlook on arms control, analyses the existing problems in this field and possible ways for their resolution, compares Donald Trump's statements on military and political issues with the president's first steps in this area, and offers forecasts and recommendations on the prospects for U.S.-Russia cooperation in arms limitations and reductions. The author proceeds from the assumption that arms control is a key component in measures to ensure international security. Even if the current tense U.S.-Russian relations provide little room for maneuver and the internal political struggle in DC sets limits on the possible bilateral measures, Moscow should nevertheless take initiative in putting forward a set of proposals to reduce weapons, especially in the very sensitive and risk-prone nuclear field. This will allow in future negotiations to proceed from options that will take into account Russian interests and the specifics of Russia's weapons systems, while at the same time showing the resolve of the nuclear superpowers to reduce existing threats through negotiations and leading the way for other countries to join. Taking into account the importance of arms control, all efforts should be made to enforce the existing treaties, consolidate the current international treaty-based legal system, and work further on new arms control and arms reduction agreements.

DT Article
DE Russia; system crisis; revolution; images of power; Nicholas II;
   psychology of power; mass psychology
AB The article shows that in 1917 it was the internal turmoil due to which the tsarist regime collapsed so fast. The crucial role was played by the common idea of the complete incapacity of Nicholas II. The image of the weak power was reinforced by all sorts of rumours about Rasputin's influence on the government decision-making, his intimate relations with the Empress, and finally, the actions of the authorities in "the interests of Germany." On the eve of the revolution Russia was rife with rumors of plots against the royal family. This meant that the public opinion was ready for the violent overthrow of the existing government. The dissatisfaction with the hateful government led to a spontaneous revolt, which met no serious resistance from the authorities. The disposal of the Romanovs aroused delight in the society. At the same time, the masses demanded the immediate deliverance from all the burdens of wartime. It could not provide new power. Everywhere crowds destroyed "tsarist" emblems and other attributes of the old power. Even the Russian Orthodox Church almost unanimously turned away from its formal chief. However, very soon it became clear that the political culture of the elites was at odds with the social aspirations of the people. The masses were increasingly called for the immediate solution to all vital problems - particularly to stop the war and immediately resolve the agrarian question.
   The study of the psychosocial situation in February - March 1917 assures that the monarchy was not so much overthrown by the insurgent people, but collapsed due to the internal incapacity. In fact, people only made the final blow to the exhausted authorities. Hence, the rebellious potential of the masses didn't manifest itself in full. In this regard, the subsequent attempts of the liberal and right-wing politicians to squeeze the revolutionary process into the framework of formal democracy obviously failed.

   UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HISTORY
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Polish historiography; eschatology; Catholicism; old believes
AB The article attempts to typologize the directions and approaches to the study of the eschatological perspective in Polish scientific periodicals on theological topics. One of the objectives of this article is to demonstrate the benefit of the introduction into circulation of Russian humanities literature in minor European languages even if the research subject is not limited by regional issues. Plenty of links to English-speaking, German, and French authors meet the formal requirements of the modern Russian scientific journals. However, ignoring the languages less common in the scientific use can lead to lapses in historiographical elaboration of themes. The advantage of the Historical and Religious Studies in the Polish language introduction into the scientific circulation is in the creation of new independent perspectives in the history of religion. There is certain underestimation of the Polish scientific literature on the issues of religion and the history of Christianity that is observed among the Russian-speaking researchers. This article discusses the possible causes of the relative isolation of the two largest Slav scientific schools. The paper substantiates some of the advantages of using the Polish language in the study of the history of eschatology. The author draws attention to the achievements of Polish science in the Slavonic Studies, particularly the problems of Old Believers eschatology, in a comparative analysis of the Russian and Polish historiography and the history of Christianity. A fundamental difference in the understanding of the origins of Russian religious conflict of the XVII century is evident. Russian emigrant thought was in opposition to the Soviet historical school and contrasted their understanding of the political nature of the conflict to the class and economic approach. Modern Polish researchers, Elzbieta Olzacka and Urszula Cierniak in particular, oppose their conclusions about the anthropological motivation of Russian religious conflict to the both approaches. Further, the article offers an analytical review of recent publications on the Polish eschatological issues, which exposes specific questions, which are not studied in the Russian science enough or at all. These questions concern the relations of the Christian perception of the afterlife with Gnosticism, as well as changes in the eschatological conception in the transformation of the Christian community into the institutionalized church. The article ends with a demonstration of research interest to the Polish science advances in the eschatological perspective of the famous German thinkers. In particular, Krystian Pawlaczyk refers to the works of the German scientist Karl Lowith who proved the implicit connection between historiosophy and Christian eschatology. As a result, the article draws conclusions concerning not only the benefits of attracting minority European languages in the Russian humanities research, but also the risks caused by the continuation of their neglection.

AB The article is devoted to development of natural resources of Yakutia in the first decades of the 20th century, when under the influence of political change and the growing crisis in the economy the issues of use of local raw materials to meet the needs of the population have become more relevant. The steps are discussed, taken in the early 20th century by private entrepreneurs, cooperative bodies and government organizations for scientific and engineering research of mineral resources of Yakutia, examining the prospects of their extraction and further processing. It is shown that in the period after the revolution of 1917 the role of private business initiatives for development of mineral resources began to decline significantly, the initiative in this direction passed into the hands of rural and cooperative bodies. It is noted that with the establishment of the Soviet power in Yakutia in December 1919, all the initiatives of the private and cooperative sectors in the development of handicraft production from local raw materials was terminated. It is emphasized that the state concentrated in its hands all the activities, including scientific research, in searching, exploration and industrial processing of mineral resources of Yakutia. The authors conclude that in the studied period the study of natural resources increasingly was not only of scientific, but above all of practical interest, which was linked with the need to find solutions to the economic crisis caused by the war and revolution of 1917.

DT Article
DE efficiency; evaluation of philosophical studies; humanities; national
   philosophy; territorial marketing; educational policy
ID SCOTTISH PHILOSOPHY
AB This article attempts to answer the question: what kind of ' efficiency' contemporary studies in the humanities and, in particular, in philosophy may have. The author starts with an analysis of scholarly publications which, in order to meet certain social and political challenges, employ philosophical instruments, and then assesses the limits within which such usage is still possible. The publications brought here under examination are selected from a number of philosophical and interdisciplinary learned journals focused on the problems of domestic and foreign policy of several nations, insofar as it is related to institutional policy. Among the published works chosen for the survey, there are some which appeared in the Journal of Scottish Philosophy; these are indicative of the importance national traditions in thinking can have even in the age of global 'intellectual networks'. Discussion of the efficiency of philosophy will benefit from introducing the notion of 'territorial marketing': such a representation of the national history of ideas will be relevant not only on an intradisciplinary level, but can also be regarded as part of the strategy to promote an attractive image of the respective country. Another type of similar strategy is exemplified by Carlin Romano's book America the Philosophical. The interdependence between the intellectual significance of advances in the humanities and the position occupied by a country in the political arena (e.g. such journals as East European Politics & Societies) is also worth consideration. It is in the context of this problem that one has to investigate the principles of objective and politically unbiased assessment of the role of social studies and the works of art. Potential efficiency of philosophy in determining the scope and methods of educational policy and in the intercultural communication can be studied, respectively, on the example of such journals as Journal of Philosophy of Education (the use of philosophical apparatus in discussing the problem of teaching patriotism at school) and Social Identities: Journal for the Study of Race, Nation and Culture.

The state of Russian-Spanish political and economic relations is analyzed as before the Ukrainian crisis and in the conditions of aggravation of international tension. The phases of formation of the image of Spain in Russia are determined: romantic, prevailed until the early twentieth century, "Soviet" associated with the civil war, and modern, based on the development of political contacts and personal observations. The influence of political, economic and cultural factors on the formation of lasting representation of the country, as well as on the stereotypes is considered.

AB The author puts the problem of verification of historiographical hypotheses about the social and political (party) homogeneity of scientists in the 1920-1930s through accounting of the Communists in the scientific community, their distribution across disciplines, geographical location, age and qualification. Through the analysis of statistical documentation for 1929, 1932, 1937, the author comes to the observation that the stratum of the Communists was thin in the scientific community of the 1920-1930s; there was no opposition "old" and "new" scientific institutions (Academy of Sciences of the USSR and the Communist Academy of the USSR) and no relationship between partisanship of scientists and granting social and economic privileges by them. The author makes the conclusion that social and demographic characteristics of the scientific community in 1929-1937 do not confirm a breakthrough in the development of science: we could not find hard state request "partisanship" in science and the scientific community was not party and social homogeneity. So, it is incorrect to talk about the pre-war soviet science as "communist" in aspects of its socio-demo-graphic characteristics.

AB The article considers issues of social and political transformations in Russia in the late 1980s - early 2000s. It analyzes the historical forks on the road that determined the catastrophe of the Soviet state and the establishment of neopatrimonialism in post-Soviet Russia. Issues of institution building, the dichotomy of structure and agency, as well as the role of network interactions are discussed in the theoretical context of political ontology. The authors show that the social and political dynamic of the perestroika era is broadly consistent with the logic that leads to the onset of a "critical juncture" in the functioning of Soviet political system. The weakening of the rigid hierarchical structure of governance created suitable conditions for new actors (individual as well as collective) to enter the political arena, and the scope of their activities was rapidly expanding. It is equally important that the Soviet system was permeated with a multitude of informal network interactions providing circulation and reallocation of resources. Those interactions ultimately transformed the essence of the system, reconciling the official ideology and repressive practices with the realities of late sovietism. As a result, by the time the USSR disintegrated, an utterly unstable institutional constellation had taken shape, in which informal institutions mostly served as mechanisms correcting the actions of formal ones. Demanding the "return of the state" at the end of the 1990s mainly had to do with the fact that further expansion of informal institutions and relations could transform from a mechanism of reducing uncertainty into a source of generating new social risks. Meanwhile, in high demand was the ability of a political leader on top of the power hierarchy to manage uncertainty and risks, even if it was exercised by using a combination of formal and informal institutions. In fact, in the late 1990s - early 2000s a request was fulfilled for system stabilization, establishment of generally understandable and acceptable "rules of the game", besides in a compromise version, excluding property redistribution, as well as "privatization" of the state by particular network structures. In general, this regime transformation is a milestone that should be regarded not as a mere change of political leadership, but as a negotiation of the critical phase of post-Soviet development and the onset of a historically long stage characterized by a relative balance between hierarchy and networks, formal and informal institutions, agency and structure.

DT Article
DE History; revolution; power; people; politics; society; philosophy;
   culture; development; public consciousness
AB This article analyzes the change in the semantic field of the concept of revolution in the context of the perception of History. It is argued that the initial meanings of this concept first appeared in the early modern period at the intersection of the philosophy of history and the philosophy of politics to describe the radical new sociopolitical order and were closely associated with the concepts of social progress and emancipation. In many ways, the tragic experience of the twentieth century resulted in a significant correction in the interpretation of History, which led to a sharp criticism of the deterministic and progressive concepts of the historical process, and caused a transformation in the semantic field of the concept of revolution. This ushered in a conceptual rupture between the concept of revolution and the concepts of progress and emancipation. Revolution as event also came into question, which precipitated a shift from traditional society to Modernity.

AB Does modern mass consciousness actually exist? To answer this question L. Fishman draws attention to a paradox in social studies. On the one hand, mass consciousness is known to stem from everyday routine, on the other hand, the studies of real mass consciousness tend to focus on its superficial manifestations determined by political ideologies, ephemeral states of mind, manipulative influence of the mass media, etc. Moreover, most popular socio-philosophical concepts describe Modernity as devoid of its own constants of being. Hence, it becomes impossible to single out modern mass consciousness, which succumbs to the association with pre-modern heritage. Fishman offers an alternative approach to studying modern mass consciousness as determined by lifestyle in technogenic environment and uses Russian and foreign realities to analyze some elements of this consciousness.

AB The process of formation of bases for self-identity are investigated as well as attribute characteristics of the humanitarian-artistic intelligentsia of Russia in 1830-1850. Specific features of the particular inter-class group of intellectuals of intelligentsia reflection are distinguished. The author identifies the self-identity of the noble intellectual elite outside the public service and a way of self-expression in literature as the key moments which determined the fate of pre-revolutionary Russian intelligentsia as a whole. A clear correlation between the development of public thought and literature, typical for the 19th century, is mentioned. Special attention is paid to understanding the innovative role of the literary elite in the processes of socio-cultural modernization. Objectives of the study determined the certain stratum of exploratory analysis: the study of linguistic structures and speech practices - discourses that existed among educated communities in 1830-1850. Socio-political and psychological factors that influenced the choice of axiological meanings and behaviour patterns of various reference groups of literary and historiosophical orientation are analysed. Socio-philosophical analysis of the spiritual experience of the Russian culture revealed the phenomenon of intellectual history - a contemplative-philosophical linguistic social code and variations of communicativecognitive relationship to the world of Russian intellectuals. Russian dominant of social consciousness is explored as a social phenomenon and objective representative of the realities of culture. Connotative, additional meaning to the antithesis of "Russia - West" are examined in the context of raising the national question in philosophical variations and personal associations of the authors of psycho-mental models of world construction.

DE Grand Chessboard; Eurasia; power; geopolitics; force; counterforce;
   veto; national interest; national security
AB In the article, it is attempted to identify and analyze the profound changes that have taken place in the geopolitical picture of the vast Eurasian space over the past three decades. The concept of Zb. Brzezinski, the well-known American analyst who portrayed Eurasia as a "Grand Chessboard" where the winner represented by the United States is known in advance, enounced in his similar-name book (which has been gaining increasing popularity in 1990s and 2000s) is used as an original premise. It is shown that within the first fifteen years of the 21st century, due to a combination of factors, the geopolitical situation in Eurasia changed dramatically. The revival of Russia as a strong military and political power capable to defend its national interests, the emergence of powerful new actors such as China, the weakening of geopolitical positions of the West in general and the U.S. in particular, their defeat in aggressive wars and other failures have led to deep cracks in the conventional Grand Chessboard, which have brought about changes in both the lineup of the leading players and the rules of the game on it. These cracks create a serious obstacle for Washington in terms of maintaining its positions in this vast region, which is of key importance for the prospects of the modern world community. But at the same time, it is necessary to take into account that the United States as a great military and political power simply will not give up the protection of their interests in Eurasia as a whole, and particularly in Central Asia. The most rational and acceptable way for all sides to solve the key problems of the region is seen in the transformation of Eurasia with common efforts into a sort of testing ground for peace, cooperation and harmonization of basic interests in mutually beneficial and healthy competition, or, in other words, a fair game of chess. The aim of this game could not be a zero sum result, but the search for conditions, forms and means of a positive, responsible cooperation of all stakeholders. However, as history shows, the content, nature, scope, prevalence and levels of positive or negative settings of inter-state relations depend on how the states see and perceive each other, to what extent they trust each other. We must not forget that not arms, or an arms race, cause wars, but on the contrary, the competing parties' attitude for war leads to an arms race.

AB The advantages of using linguistic corpora data in education and research are well covered in specialized literature. What is less well described, however, is how corpora of minor languages can contribute to producing various types of dictionaries which could be used for educational purposes. The paper focuses on perspectives of applying the existing corpora of the Tatar language to the dictionary making process. This would make it possible to update the available lexicographic resources, as well as to make new ones, taking into consideration those specific features of Tatar that may present certain difficulties for learners, i.e. its agglutinative morphology, the length of affixal chains, various types of collocations, etc.
   The current study considers possible ways to improve the structure and contents of the available Tatar dictionaries that could benefit from involving corpus data. The volume of the corpora may guarantee data typicality and ensure completeness of representation of the whole range of linguistic phenomena, which is crucial in compiling dictionaries used in language acquisition. Also, the paper describes some principles of compiling new lexicographic resources, paying a special attention to the project of developing the Tatar-Russian Socio-Political Dictionary of Collocations. It is one of the first attempts to make a Tatar corpus-based dictionary which would embrace socially significant layers of Tatar vocabulary in active use, with the electronic form of the dictionary promoting its easy update and replenishment. The dictionary is provided with real empirical data reflecting slightest changes in Tatar and may be used by students who would want to strengthen their existing vocabulary. Generally it is supposed to be widely used in education, especially in mastering Tatar by advanced learners, in training future Tatar journalists, politicians and public figures, as well as translators.

ID REFORM
AB This article analyses post-Soviet reforms in Russia, and treats them as an example of 'authoritarian modernization', which were implemented to achieve a high level of socioeconomic development by focusing on rapid economic growth while neglecting political democratization. It discusses the arguments in favour of authoritarian modernization as such, and the dilemmas, challenges, and constraints in its implementation which became evident during the period of 1990-2010s. A special emphasis is made on the poor quality of the Russian state against the background of its relatively low international integration. The rent-seeking nature of the state together with the formation and further entrenchment of an electorally authoritarian regime provide negative incentives for the implementation of authoritarian modernization. The article considers a number of contradictions associated with such a project in Russia, including some unintended consequences of the economic growth, including the growth of the demands for democratization, the disjuncture between ambitious policy reforms and their inept implementation by the state apparatus, and the 'mediocrity syndrome' resulting from unjustified claims of Russia's unique influence on the global scale. The article concludes that the features of Russia's current political and economic order impose insurmountably high barriers for the implementation of authoritarian modernization in terms of ideas, institutions, and policies, thereby exhausting the very potential of this project.

Macmillan is analysed to normalization of the situation in Cyprus in the second half of 1950-ies, complicated as a result of national liberation struggle of the Greek Cypriots unfolding on the island, who supported the idea of enosis (a movement for annexation to Greece). Also the main problems and disagreements in the positions of Turkey, Greece and the UK on certain articles of Macmillan draft are highlighted. The number of the articles are considered on the emergence of new authorities and distribution of powers between the Governor of the island and government authorities.

DE revolution; historical choice; power; society; mass movements; freedom;
   Bolshevism
AB The year of the centenary of the Russian Revolution is coming to an end. It is time to draw conclusions. The author's key takeaway is that Russia in fact was unable to escape from the "captivity" of the October Revolution. Experts and the public focus their attention on the Bolshevik Revolution, whereas almost no one is interested in the February Revolution and almost everyone denounces it. The attitude to the Tsarist Russia remains super negative. The collective memory tends to ascribe all of the country's historical achievements to the Soviet era. The author attempts to reveal the multifaceted nature of the Russian Revolution, its complex socio-psychological structure and nonlinearity of events. She asks whether the Russian Revolution can be considered on equal terms with the European revolutions of the late 18th - early 20th centuries, and her answer is negative. The year of 1917 opened a series of revolutions of a "new type" that literally were a reaction to modernity rather than locomotives of history. The historical end of the Russian Revolution is a country's failure in its centuries-long evolution towards greater freedom and modern social structure. Even today Russia has not overcome this legacy.

AB The goal of this research is coverage of the extent of knowledge by historical science of daily life of the German population living in St. Petersburg in the second half of the XIX - at the beginning of the XX centuries. As sources were involved monographs, brochures, collections of scholarly writings, thesis of reports of conferences, articles of periodical publications, dissertations, exhibition catalogs, published by domestic and foreign scientists. Were allocated and characterized the stages of development of historiography. Among the works of pre-revolutionary period was dominated by the materials on the daily life of the Germans in separate colonies; history of the Lutheran Church in St. Petersburg and in Russia in general and also the activities of German schools. Directly during this period the daily life of Germans of St. Petersburg not became the subject of study. Right up to 60 years of the XX century, the German issues were closed to research for political and ideological reasons. At that time was dominated by propagandistic brochures. However, the value of this period was that there appeared the first works on the study of the peculiarities of language of German Diaspora (V. Zhirmunsky, A. Strem). The first significant scientific works on separate aspects of the life of Germans of St. Petersburg were published in 80 years of the XX century. They had analyzed the occupational structure of the Germans of St. Petersburg, the extent of involvement of Diaspora in economic, social and cultural life of the capital, legal position (I.B. Kotler, T.A. Schrader). The revival of interest in the German issue occurred in the beginning of 90-ies, in many ways, this contributed to the emergence of the possibility to study early closed for access materials of Russian libraries and archives. Happened systematization and publication of previously unavailable sources. Began to pass international conferences and seminars dedicated to the lifestyle and culture of citizens of German origin; was created the first centers of self-organization of the Russian Germans. The subject of consideration in this period became confessional history of the German population (A. V. Werner, N. Ivanova, O. Kurilo); questions related to education (N. Blagovo, V. Deduylin, G. Smagina, N. Ulyanov); economic and social activities (E. Bakhmutskaya, O. Girshtein, N. Ivanova, S. Lebedev, V. Sartor, E. Yakovleva); the features of everyday life and mores (L. Naidich). Considerable interest among the researches of this period was represented the work of A. V. Keller for the study of the domestic life of the Germans. Achievement of the historiography of the modern period can be considered as the appearance of publications about the life, professional and social activities of individual representatives of the German Diaspora (B. Ananyich, E. Annenkova, N. Beregoi, D. Dahlman, O. Krivdina, P. Popov). Research became more highly specialized. Despite the significant shifts of modern national historiography, we can talk about existence of gaps in the issues of study of daily life of the Germans, to make up for that by attracting for study additional sources of information (record keeping documents, sources of personal origination, statistical materials, periodical publications, art literature (belles-lettres)).

AB The beginning of the 21111 century has been marked by the strengthening of the political forces that criticize the European idea and its institutional embodiment the European Union. The number of Eurosceptic parties has increased, and their electoral base has enlarged. In many EU countries they managed to convert the protest state of public opinion into political parties and to achieve significant results at the elections at different level. The Eurosceptic forces succeeded in turning the election of May 2014 to the European Parliament into demonstration of their triumph. The article illustrates the multifaceted nahire of party-based Euroscepticism on the political behavior of three parties, namely Alternative for Gemiany, Freedom Party of Austria and Swiss People's Party. The author concludes that the Euroscepticism has become one of the most significant recent trends in Europe.

   Communities in Krasnodar Region
SO MIR ROSSII-UNIVERSE OF RUSSIA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE ethnicity; ethnic minorities; discourses; social inequality; social
   capital
AB Depending on the social context ethnicity can be viewed both as a constraint, and a resource to gain social, economic and political benefits. This article analyses various strategies to exploit ethnic identity and reveals the factors which determine the choice of particular strategies by ethnic communities by drawing on the case of the Krasnodar region. In particular, the focus is on the discourse used by the representatives of different ethnic communities to gain advantages over others, the practices of ethnic protectionism and ethnic lobbying, the abandonment of these practices altogether in favour of assimilation with the ethnic majority, and the influence of the political context on the choice of certain practices. To understand the mechanisms that transform ethnic identity into a specific type of social resource we rely on Bourdieu's theory of capital (and particularly the notions of social, economic, political and symbolic capitals and their conversion).
   The article is based on the results of the study "Forecasting modelling of interethnic relations in Russian regions (on the basis of the identification strategies used by ethnic communities residing beyond territories of respective nations)".
   The empirical study uses data from 9 focus groups with the representatives of Armenian, Adyg (Circassian), Ukrainian, Greek, Tatar, Chechen, Dagestan, Tajik and Uzbek communities as well as 12 interviews with experts.
   The study reveals that the transformation of ethnicity into a resource is often the mirror of the obstacles a particular ethnic community face and serves as a way to surmount these obstacles. Using ethnicity as a resource requires substantial investments that may be material or intangible. Investments are made by rank-and-file representatives of ethnic communities and by high status persons, both at the individual and the group levels. Not everybody always uses his/her ethnicity as a resource. Integration with the ethnic majority is an alternative strategy. A lack of considerable external and cultural differences between representatives of the ethnic minority and majority promotes the selection of this strategy. Using ethnicity for getting preferences becomes possible when a differentiated approach to different ethnic groups is institutionalized and the emergence of a situation under which some groups occupy privileged positions while other groups are in the position of outsiders.

AB The article presents an overview of the main theoretical approaches to judicial politics revealing the impact of institutional and non-institutional factors. On the basis of the analysis of the existing theoretical models of judicial politics and the relationships between the court and key political players, the author hypothesizes that, despite common theoretical grounds, there is an important distinction between constitutional courts in authoritarian and democratic regimes. Under authoritarianism, judges possess fundamentally different expectations about the prospects for a regime change and therefore are guided by a different yardstick when building internal judicial institutions. While under democracies courts have to succumb to government needs only in some ad hoc cases, such as at times of highly consolidated power, under autocracies this has to be a stable institutional solution.

AB The results of the comparative analysis of two novels - by American author S. Lewis ("Arrowsmith") and American writer of Russian origin Ayn Rand ("Altas shrugged") - are presented. The images of scientists, the authors' attitudes to the problems of science and money, science and power, science and reason, scientific and technological progress presented in the works are compared. The novelty of the research lies in the fact that these novels have never before been compared. Actuality of work is conditioned by the importance of the analysis of the different philosophical views of Lewis and Rand on socialism and capitalism, that found a contact in criticism of the contemporary political system of the first half of the 20th century. In the study the author notes that in both novels in different ways the position of science in a capitalist society, the relations of scientists and government representatives are shown, at that Lewis puts the consumer above the creator, and Rand lets the creator to be the center of the universe, towering above the crowd of consumers. It is alleged that the writers' evaluation of the role of creators and consumers in the development of society can be projected in their attitude to the ideology of socialism and capitalism. However both authors warn about the evils of consumer attitudes to science in the contemporary political system.

TI THE IMEMO ARCTIC RESEARCH (Political and Legal Basis for the Arctic
   Ocean's Regime)
SO MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE The Arctic; Arctic Ocean; 1982 UN Law of the Sea Convention; internal
   historical waters; Arctic channels; Northern Sea Route;
   closed/semi-enclosed sea
AB The problems connected with the World Ocean space and ocean resources development, including the Arctic region, have always been at priority level amongst the IMEMO research. The article shows which subjects related to the Arctic region were most demanded at the Institute, and why different forecasts of previous years have not lost their importance and relevance up to the present time. The first part of the research deals with theoretical questions that characterize the legal regime of the Arctic which is based on the broad legal platform, including the 1982 UN Law of the Sea Convention, customary international law norms and provision, as well as national legislation of Arctic states. It means that the legal status of the Arctic Ocean was formed long before the 1982 Convention adoption under the predominant role of customary law, historical legal foundations, Russian and Canadian juridical practice (as of countries with the longest Arctic coastline). Principal differences between the Arctic Ocean and other maritime regions, such as Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans, due to its geographical isolationism, shallow character, the longest shelf zone, special climate conditions, including the presence of ice and special environmental vulnerability, are considered. All attempts to extend different concepts of public domain or world heritage, or even common heritage of mankind to the Arctic Ocean should be declared as speculative and completely incorrect. The common heritage of mankind concept can be applied exclusively to the resources of the seabed and subsoil beyond areas of national jurisdiction of coastal states. So, speaking about the Arctic, this concept can be applied only to the International seabed area (ISA) resources, but only if ISA would be formed here by the Arctic states. The common heritage of mankind status cannot be applied to water spaces, including the Arctic Ocean. In accordance with the 1982 Convention, the waters covering the International Seabed Area are always High Sea, without any exceptions. The legal background of internal historical wares status application to some Russian Arctic seas is analyzed. The main problem here consists in the absence of definite criteria for this kind of qualification in the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention. However, years after the UNCLOS was signed, the practice of states went on the way to expand the number of exceptions as for the bays considered as historic waters. Previously, it could be done only for the bays with the entrance width no more than 24 miles (or two maximum width of the territorial sea), but then all claims have become associated with bays with wide entrance, often very much higher than 24 miles. In addition, historical claims started to be raised not only in respect of bays, but also of small seas, by geographical characters very similar to bays. In the international legal doctrine, three main criteria for the lawful establishment of the historic waters regime, recognized by all, were formed under the following conditions: special geographical location of the waters (especially - away from international shipping lanes); special security and economic interests of the coastal state (the value of the water region and its resources for the economy of a country's coastal part, or even for the whole country); the subjective intention of the coastal state to seek approval for a historic title under a silent recognition of the actual ownership by other states, and, more or less prolonged, continuous and peaceful (not interrupted) exercise of power (or sovereignty).
   Taking all these circumstances into account, and that the establishment of the international maritime law rules relating to historic waters went mainly towards the development of customary, not treaty norms, some coastal states, including the USSR, applied this legal status to different maritime regions, in particular Arctic seas and straits. The last topic is connected with the legitimacy of semi-enclosed sea status applicability to the whole Arctic region. Given the fact that a large part of the Arctic Ocean, except its central part with the High Seas legal status, is an area of the Arctic states' sovereignty and jurisdiction, and that the non-regional states' entrance to the Arctic is connected with crossing of these waters both from Northern Atlantic and Northern Pacific, it seems possible to extend the Convention's semi-enclosed status to the whole Arctic Ocean. However, the discussion about the Arctic Ocean identification as an enclosed or semi-enclosed sea, comparable with the Baltic and the Mediterranean, is still in process. This proposal has its supporters and opponents, especially from non-regional countries - particularly China. Meanwhile, the revival of the "Arctic Mediterranean" concept in recent years which characterizes a possible governance regime in the Arctic leads to the top level of the Arctic states' interest consideration. Finally, the protection of Russia's national interests in the Arctic region should be successive in character and based on experience and scientific developments that have been achieved in previous years in the framework of IMEMO.

DT Article
DE progress; social theory; science; philosophy; modernization; technology
AB The article deals with the basic aspects of interpretations of the concept and theory of progress in the modern social philosophic discourse. The idea of progress in recent decades is constantly being diversified. By the end of the twentieth century, the differences of evaluations reached their apogee due to the growing sense of opposition of alternatives contained in historical development. This tendency is expressed in a complex dialogue of philosophers and scientists generated by optimistic and pessimistic perceptions of progress. Equally important is the philosophical interpretation of progress, according to which the ability of people to improve endows it with a characteristic feature of "temporal compensatory concept" (R. Koselleck). Thus, the idea of progress acquires the features of the defensive conservative factor of modern civilization, which is constantly fixed in modern social and political theory (M. Freeden) and the philosophy of science (K. Popper).

   clean energy; TPP; HPP; nuclear power plant
AB Strengthening the influence of India in the Asian region and in the world requires for resorting of the modernization experience of this country, including the development of its energy sector. India today is among the top ten countries to generate electricity per capita. At the same time, both traditional sources of energy production coexist in India (using the muscular strength of man and animals) with the conditions for the development of modern energy infrastructure through foreign investments. The article attempts to trace the main stages of the formation and development of energy industry in India; the modern state of energy is analyzed and plans for its development are considered. The research is based on a complex of traditional methods and approaches based on the principle of scientific objectivity and systemic method used in research in the framework of international relations and political science. For more than a century of history of the development of energy sector in India significant success has been achieved. Starting with the electrification of large cities and industrial enterprises due to foreign investments in the colonial period, India, after gaining the independence, set the task of developing its own infrastructure, electrifying the countryside and providing the industry with energy resources. The greatest progress in the development of electric power and nuclear energy was made. Indian economic growth will increase India's energy needs and quadruple the demand for electricity over the next 25 years. For this, India needs to solve the problems of energy efficiency, energy complex management, lack of standards and energy imports, as well as actively introduce alternative energy sources and move to clean electricity (increased use of water resources and solar energy), which can be done through the development of Russian - Indian cooperation.

TI IMAGE OF THE "SOCIALIST CITY" IN PUBLIC RHETORIC: DEBATES OF THE
   INTERWAR PERIOD AND MODERN LANGUAGES OF DESCRIPTION
SO VESTNIK PERMSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-ISTORIYA-PERM UNIVERSITY HERALD-HISTORY
LA Russian
DT Article
DE socialist city; public rhetoric; interwar period; languages of
   description; the Soviet urban areas; symbolic transformation; urban
   planning
AB The article analyzes the establishment of the concept of the "socialist city" in intellectual debates of the 1920s and 1930s by considering its normative component, values and regulative power with special attention paid to symbolic transformation of the image of "socialist city" in modern rhetoric context. The author theoretically substantiates that there are three main types of discourses reproducing the image of "socialist city" today. The logic of their use, the main meanings and symbolic contours are analyzed. It is argued that the spread of the rhetoric of "heritage" was connected with the desire to keep symbolic distance from the Soviet past, as well as to move the discussion on the Soviet urban areas beyond a socio-political context. Meanwhile, if the rhetoric of "heritage" just outlined symbolic contours of "socialist cities" fixing them in public consciousness, the "utopian" discourse managed to propose a completely new framework for their interpretation, filling those spaces with new meanings and, thus, shaping a new language of their description. Relying on the analysis of the interwar debates and modern rhetoric, the author concludes that discursive component appeared to be a key element that determined the development of socialist cities and not only played the role of symbolic accompaniment for the city building reforms but also served as an important ideological and social regulator.

DT Article
DE public administration efficiency and quality; criteria; Weberian state;
   theory of impartial political institutions; concept of embedded autonomy
AB The purpose of the article is to generalize, systematize and develop a number of key theories and concepts of public administration efficiency and quality. The author classifies and criticizes the conceptual framework of the study and evaluates the efficiency and quality of public administration. It has been found out that the traditional "functionalist" approaches based on assessment of the achieved socially significant results or economic growth are important, especially in the context of using the program-target method of administration, yet insufficient. The novelty of the research is that in contrast to the authors proposing assessments based on trivial indicators of regions' socio-economic development, the author substantiates the importance of using the complex approach in assessing the effectiveness/quality of public administration, which helps consider not only the "effectiveness", but also the quality of procedural mechanisms of public administration (autonomy of the executive power in choosing mechanisms of the implementation of identified policy goals; level of transparency and objectivity of mechanisms of selection and job promotion, professionalization of government employees). The research methods include system analysis and applied conceptualization. The article considers the following three sources of basic criteria of the quality of public administration: 1) the system of criteria of M. Weber's modern state model; 2) B. Rothstein's theory of impartial political institutions 3) P. Evans' concept of embedded autonomy. The practical significance of the article is that it shows in detail and with examples of the Russian management practice that the use of theory-based criteria for assessing the quality of public administration is accompanied by a set of complex problems, both methodological and instrumental. Many of these problems have not been solved yet. In the final part of the article, the author, referring to the current experience of regions, analyzes the difficulties of implementing the outlined concepts in the framework of practical assessment of public administration quality and efficiency. The author considers that a promising area for the development of this research is the development of methodological tools for assessing the quality of public administration at the sub-federal level, based on methodological criteria which are ignored in the modern practice of public administration.

AB The article is devoted to the phenomenon of political trust. Drawing an analogy with the role of presuppositions in a language, A. Kaniukov analyzes the role of trust in a political space and identifies a number of ways to further our understanding of this concept. The article raises a series of questions, including whether political trust is real, in what ways the concept of trust relates to the concept of confidence, how this phenomenon relates to religion and fanaticism, and whether trust can be viewed as a process of communication. Particular attention is paid to understanding the relationship between trust and faith. The author concludes that recognizing the enormous role of faith in the political process should increase the society's ability to resist political manipulation. Understanding that there is no place for knowledge in the political space, and there is only faith, will promote the development of critical thinking and tolerance and, as a result, contribute to the development of civil society.

DT Article
DE revolution; Modernity; event; causation through freedom; event subject;

AB This article disputes the possibility and reason for any general theory of revolution (philosophical or metahistorical) that claims to reveal the "essence" of this phenomenon without regard for the context in which any particular revolution occurs. The article describes revolutions as contingent and self-constituting events. Their triggers, but not their causes, are the dysfunctions of existing orders (the incompleteness of the structuredness of these orders). Such events are a special kind of historical and political practice and are characterized primarily as the initiation of a mechanism that Kant called causation through freedom, and the emergence of collective actors possessing the properties of a political subject (as strictly an event, not metaphysical subject). Such events are possible only in the context of Modernity, just as Modernity itself persists until and to the extent that it bears the imprint of these events, both in its institutional organization and in its historical memory (as a belief in the feasibility of an alternative to existing structures of domination, and not as an homage to the "museum of revolution," which fixes it in a "glorious" but lifeless past).

AB In this paper, the author traces down the evolution of social and political ideas of the eminent Russian philosopher of the 20th century Semyon Ludwigovich Frank (1877-1950). As a young man, Frank had been an adherent of the Marxist variety of radical socialism; only the events of 1905-1907 led him, as well as other young intellectuals of his generation, such as Berdyaev, Bulgakov, Struve, Isgoev, Kistyakovski and others, to abandoning Marxism and positivism first for moderate Christian liberalism and then eventually for liberal conservatism. The immediate effect of the first Russian revolution on Frank was that he became member of the Constitutional Democratic Party and took part in 1909 collection of essays Vekhi ('Landmarks'). The article, further on, contains a detailed analysis of the most important among Frank's writings in political philosophy, mainly intended to debunk the ideology of Russian revolutionary intelligentsia, such as Philosophical prerequisites of Despotism (1907), The Ethics of Nihilism (Frank's contribution to Vekhi, 1909), De profundis (an essay from the homonymous collection of 1918), and the emigrant publication Beyond the Left and the Right (1930).

TI Islam in Religious Structure of the Soviet State in 1920s: Revisiting
   Policies and Regional Practices in a National Region: A Case-Study of
   Dagestan
SO HERALD OF AN ARCHIVIST
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Archive; sources; Dagestan; Soviet state; religious policy; Muslim
   clergy; Sharia; education
AB Growing interest in researching the 'gaps' in the post-Soviet Russian history has prompted a large-scale study of regional history. There are issues of particular interest concerning the relationship between authorities and national religious organizations, such as activities of state agencies dealing with Muslims and Muslim religion in the Republic of Dagestan.
   Centuries of Islam spreading in Dagestan made it a rallying point for the people, a core national idea. In the first years of Soviet rule there were significant changes in authorities' attitude towards Islam. Changes in the sphere of religion sprang not only from the political situation, but were also based on the new Soviet law. Aware of strong religious commitment of the Muslim population of the republic, first Soviet leaders conducted a cautious policy towards Muslim clergy, Islam and Sharia. Taking note of the importance of religion in the lives of the people of Dagestan, the article highlights extremely cautious Soviet policy in spiritual sphere. Thus, for a time Soviet ethno-confessional policy was a half-way, conciliatory one, with many a deviation from the 1918 Decree. The author tries to show the duality of the authorities' attitude towards Islamic religion. Initial attempts to find a compromise between the new power and religion as a worldview and a socio-cultural system, which characterized 1920s, gradually grew into confrontation, as the authorities attempted to supplant religion in the consciousness of the people of Dagestan and their everyday life. The author highlights two stages in the implementation of the Soviet ethno-confessional policy: the compromise and the advance. She assesses the results of the authorities' actions, such as shutting-off of mosques and Muslim schools, confiscation of lands. And yet she contends the ill-success of these attempts to replace all things 'Islamic' by secular Soviet features. The Soviets could not eradicate the Islamic institutes, although they forced them to 'go underground.' The religiousness of the population and the counter-revolutionary opposition of the Muslim clergy baffled the implementation of Soviet anti-religious policies.
   The article is based on the archival materials from the Central State Archive of the Republic of Dagestan and from the Russian State Historical Archive. Periodicals of the period have been introduced into historical scholarship. And yet some documents, although published, have remained unstudied. The author analyzes main points of the Soviet religious policy towards Muslim population and clergy of the Republic of Dagestan under the above mentioned circumstances and in view of existing national scholarship.

TI INSTITUTIONS AND STATISTICS: THE CASE OF FIXED ASSETS ACCOUNTS
SO TERRA ECONOMICUS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE institutions; economic statistics; fixed assets statistics; state;
   business community; civil society; economic science
AB The paper analyzes the impact of institutions upon the state of economic statistics. The study focuses on the most complex and essential area of economic statistics: the fixed assets statistics. Its positions under various social-and-economic systems are considered. The authors show that its emergence under capitalism was facilitated by developing private entrepreneurship, democracy and respect of the authorities and society towards science and high education. A comparative analysis of these statistical data across different countries proves their dependence on the level of national economic-and-cultural development, and advancement of private business. For instance, it was absent in the tsarist Russia. Development of the fixed assets statistics in the command economies is analyzed using an example of the USSR. It ascertained that its state in the 1930s-1950s was depressing, which is explained by prevalence of orientation towards physical indicators in the actual planning practice in that period. At the same time, unlike capitalism, individual researchers could not perform and especially publish independent estimates of the costs and trend patterns for fixed assets due to political reasons. They could destroy an illusion of enormously successful Soviet economy. After a short period of relatively objective determination of the costs of the fixed assets stock of in 1960 it continued deteriorating. Due to degradation of economic science, criticism of the state of this segment of economic statistics practically terminated. In the post-Soviet period, the gap between the fixed asset statistics and the reality reached its peak. Currently it is the worst in the world in terms of the credibility level, particular due to a gloomy quality of public administration, civil society, business community and economic science. Poor fixed assets statistics prevents reasonable analyzing and forecasting of the processes of Russian economy.

TI CONTAGIOSITY OF TERRORISM: SOCIAL-PSYCHOLOGICAL ORIGINS
SO MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE terrorism; contagiosity; strategy and tactics of extremism
AB This article is a follow-up to the article "Some Approaches to Interpretation of Terrorism Phenomenon" published in "World Economy and International Relations", no. 5 (2015), which detailed specific aspects of what motivates the lower and mid-level members of terrorist networks to get involved in terrorist activities, and to the article "Ideological Justification of Terrorism as a Political Tool" published in the same journal, no. 1 (2017), which studied political reasoning for terrorist activities. The author sees terrorism as a system issue and a complex phenomenon implying a few factors. One of these factors is contagiosity of terrorist activities. Creation of a unified information environment in the late 20th century made it possible for formerly marginal organizations to acquire unprecedented efficiency; they started to exchange experience and technologies that have already proven effective in some regions. A psycho-sociological paradigm of terrorists' motivation is viewed in the context of social environment and psychological atmosphere that dominate in the society. The contagiosity makes itself evident in the way terrorists take a decision to launch an attack. So, the time of a terrorist attack is not selected randomly, but has its sequence. High level of terrorist threat in one month is followed by its decline in the next month, so terrorist groups exercise their attacks depending on assaults made by other organizations. At the same time, such groups can have various ideologies and no connection among themselves, thus their activities are not coordinated in reality. Terrorists just take their lead from one another and repeat successful tactics. Terrorism is no longer limited to one country or one region. Due to mass media coverage, - the spread of television in 1960-ies and of the Internet at the turn of the century, - terrorists started to learn from each other and exchange technologies, knowledge, tactics and even militants. The author analyses the most prominent terrorist organizations and shows how they have learned to use the global information highway to their advantage.

DE Sources; Archive of the RAN; Russian revolution; 1917; history;

AB The article reviews documents from the personal provenance fonds and those of academic institutions on the history of the revolutionary events in Russia in 1917 that are stored in the Archive of the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAN). The article strives to add to the source base on the history of the Russian revolution of 1917, as documentary collections from the Archive of the RAN (Moscow) have hardly ever qualified as sources of the history of the revolution of 1917 (chiefly, unpublished). Documents deposited in the Archives of the RAN date from 1917 to 1987. By late 1980s interest in the revolutionary events of 1917 plummeted due to the adverse effects of Perestroika, collapse of the Soviet Union and changes in socio-political system of Russia, as well as following a general trend to revise national history. There have been little, if any, publications on the history of the revolutionary events of 1917 based on the documents of the Archive of the RAN over the past 25 years. Documentary collections of the Archive of RAN on the history of the revolution of 1917 in Russia can be divided into two groups: documents pertaining to the events of February and those on the October Revolution of 1917. Documents in the first group date from 1917 to 1967, which corresponds with the scientific practice to time the research to coincide with anniversaries of the revolutionary events. These documents were deposited both in the personal provenance fonds and those of academic institutions. Documents in the personal provenance fonds of scientists have a distinction of being written, if not by participants, at least by contemporaries of the revolutionary events. Personal provenance fonds of scientists also store documents of institutions and organizations from the days of the revolution. Documents in the second group can be divided into several subgroups: the first containing documents drawn up during the revolutionary events of October-November 1917; the second including research papers of scientists on the revolutionary events of October 1917; the third comprising of papers prepared in academic institutions and organizations. Diaries, memoirs and photographs of the revolutionary events contemporaries form a stand-alone complex of documents. Identification of documents on the history of the revolutionary events of 1917 has been carried out in the "Catalogue" section of the "Accounting" directory in the database of the Archive of RAN information system. Currently, this section includes up to 29% of the Archive of the RAN files and documents titles, chiefly from personal provenance fonds of scientists. Thus, the Archive of the RAN provides a wide information field for studying the history of the revolution of 1917. These documents allow expand the source base on the history of the Russian revolution and can be used in research and for educational purposes.

ID MIDDLE-EAST; REGIME TYPE
AB The article identifies four main events driving the current changes in the Persian Gulf oil monarchies. Located in a troubled and unstable region of the Middle East with the oil prices declining after the events of the "Arab spring" and election of Donald Trump as president of the United States, Gulf oil monarchies are under pressure from inside and outside to undergo significant changes. As a consequence, validity of the theory of << monarchical exclusiveness >> is called into question. The political elites in the monarchies recognize the need to depart from the status quo, although the phenomenon of the << king's dilemma >> is still present there. The author argues that the monarchy should undergo conservative liberalization. To avoid political destabilization they should apply a gradual, evolutionary approach to liberalization providing their societies with enough time to adapt to new developments. Along with the gradual liberalisation process there is also need in institutional development to make institutions stronger and more independent.

From this perspective, deepening conflict between Russia and the USA might be explained as a clash of their political interests. The political environment of the modern system of international relations reflects the rise of political disagreements between Russia and the USA in the Central Asian republics.

AB Introduction: the article considers the original constitutional and legal requirements of the right to freedom of speech as one of the fundamental human rights, noting its complex nature as of a personal and political right. Purpose: to analyze approaches developed in the constitutional law science and in judicial practice covering the concept of "freedom of speech" and to justify the statement that the right to freedom of speech is one of the fundamental rights of the individual. Methods: the methodological basis of the research is based on a set of general scientific (analysis, synthesis, induction and deduction) and specific scientific (formal-legal, comparative law) methods of cognition. Results: the use of the right to freedom of speech involves the person's use of all the powers vested by this freedom: the right to produce and search for information, the right to make up messages out of the information, the right to transfer and disseminate information, the right to use accessible communication channels, the right to receive and decode the transferred messages, the right to hold one's own opinions and beliefs, the possibility to enjoy the freedom of communication as a commonweal. Conclusions: the constitutional right to freedom of speech is classified as the fundamental human right, it is inalienable and is given to everyone since birth. As a fundamental right, the freedom of speech provides protection against arbitrary interference of the state into the important area of the human life communication.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE Christian East; source study; archeography; theology; manuscripts
AB The article addresses activities of the Society for Studying Christian East (Forschungsstelle Christlicher Orient) of the Catholic University of Eichstatt-Ingolstadt (Germany). The Christian East included territories from Ethiopia to Georgia and from the Mediterranean to India and East Asia. The task of the Society is to study Christianity (mainly in the Middle East) from the perspective of historical science and theology. The Society actively interacts with its colleagues in other regions and countries. Of great importance are its activities in preparation of publications and description of ancient and early medieval Syrian, Coptic, Ethiopic, Arabic, Persian manuscripts, as well as texts in other Oriental languages. Among its current projects are study and scientific publication of the oldest ecclesiastical legal texts, preserved in the Coptic, Arabic, Ethiopian and Syrian manuscripts; digitization and description of Coptic manuscripts in Egypt; scientific publication of the Syrian Octoechus, a review of the East Christian manuscripts from the Andechs monastery (Bavaria); and others. In addition to research projects and teaching activities at the university, the Society publishes a collection entitled 'Eichstatter Beitrage zum Christlichen Orient' (EBCO). 5 volumes have been published by now. The article assesses various issues of the Society activities, tasks of studying history of the Christian East in connection with current political and cultural situation, and history of studying eastern manuscripts in Europe. The author makes observations concerning prospects of using the European experience for studying the Orthodoxy in the East. At present, when the Middle East is a place of complex political and social processes, publication and study of Christian culture monuments in Russia and Europe is of great importance for countries preserving their Christian traditions; it may help to achieve peace in the land of ancient civilizations. Conservation and study of historical, philological, theological, and cultural heritage of the Christian East is a significant task for archivists and historians.

DT Article
DE local content requirements; government procurement; economic growth;
   building new industries; new jobs creation; domestic business activity
AB A local content requirement (LCRs) is a widely acknowledge protective device with two simple but powerful objectives: create jobs at home rather than abroad and channel business to home firms rather that foreign firms. Historically, local content requirements have been associated primarily with government procurements and mandates imposed on publicly funded projects. Political leaders who advocate local content policy often distinguish multiple objectives. Many of recent local content requirements identified in this article were inspired by three basic related factors. First, since the onset of the Great Recession foremost they wanted to create jobs and channel business to domestic companies. Second, they may have aspirations of building a world class industry, following the logic of infant industry analysis. Third, they believe that local content policy offers a promising path to long-term economic development. Classic local content requirements give bid preferences to local supplies (e.g., 25 percent on a construction project or a narrowly defined category of goods such as military uniform) at least have the benefit of transparency. The cost of such local content requirements can be easily calculated, their administration is relatively simple? And they are not prone to corruption. Much more common are quantitative restrictions and guidelines. They are highly objectionable both on economic and political grounds. From economic standpoint their cost is highly variable depending both on underlying supply and demand conditions and on administrative factor. The same characteristics make local content requirements highly attractive to their supporters. The costs are off-budget and can be dismissed in political debate. The benefits in terms of new jobs and new industries are easily achieved and whether large or small they are immediate. The payoffs come fast as foreign supplies are excluded from the market.

AB The article presents a study of factors that determine the career choice of indigenous children Evenks, high school students in secondary general schools located in extreme climatic and llandaschety zones on the territory of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). The purpose of the article is to identify the main factors affecting the choice of careers for children - representatives of indigenous small peoples of the North, Siberia and the Far East. The study was conducted on the basis of field work on the territory of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). Field research completed on the territory of Arctic Region and the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) resulted in analysis of the factors defining the career choices made by the Evenk indigenous peoples' children, in particular senior school students' completing secondary general education in their respective territories located in extreme climatic and landscape zones. These children's parents lead a traditional life with a traditional economy (hunting, migratory reindeer breeding, and fishing). The teachers' school stuff also resides in the Arctic Region territories under extreme conditions, thus, have a huge impact on the formation of images of success with senior school students. The 2016 field research resulted in approbation of methodology aimed at revealing the correlation between the senior students' career choice, their parents' opinions, and teachers' opinions. The methodology application will allow identification of either the presence or absence of actual contradictions in actual parents' or teachers' impact on the career choices made by senior school students. The completed complex research proved there to be an increase in the territorial and economic educational differentiation of school students observed in post-Soviet Russia. The conditions for obtaining secondary education and the routine experience of school students from the Arctic indigenous peoples is insufficient for guarantying their free career choice and its compliance to the students' own ideas about what a successful life contains. Political management established within the Arctic Region territories is subject to education inequality and must take measures to liquidate this.

AB The perception and rethinking of the "dark Middle Ages" in the period of Enlightenment largely determined the interpretation of the present, and expectations for the future. That was why the appearance of Gothic images and motifs on the theatre stage was not just another phase in the history of art and architecture or a fad for the "Gothic taste", but also a factor of political propaganda geared to public opinion and domestic and foreign policies. What did the 18th-century theatre-goers and stage decorators perceive as "Gothic"? How did the "settings", iconographic tradition and predilections of European playwrights and librettists change over the Age of Enlightenment? The article looks at these and other nuances of Gothic motifs' invasion of the ephemeral architecture of the theatre stage. The grand staging of Catherine the Great's historical play The Early Reign of Oleg, in which action takes place in the "Gothic Antiquity" of the Russian state, is a special theme that graphically demonstrates the political underpinnings of recourse to the national "Gothic". A search for the iconographical prototypes of the theatre images turns out to be no less captivating than the ideologically charged reconstruction of historical memory.

AB The article reveals the possibilities of researching the elections to the State Russian Imperial Duma of the third call on the base of approaches, methods and technologies of historical geo-information science, such as creating geo-information systems (GIS) and using spatial visualization and analysis. The author created GIS maps which gave the possibility to define territorial allocation of Russian European provinces according to their modernization and other socio-cultural indexes, such as literacy, religion, social status, political preferences and connection of the results of elections to the State Russian Imperial Duma of the third call with these characteristics. The approach reveals how modernization and the mentioned socio-cultural characteristics influenced political preferences of electorate and the election results. The specific character of correlation between socio-cultural factors and the election results in the existing elector system has been discovered. In particular, the article underlines the specific interaction of socio-cultural factors and election processes and their results during the elections in the conditions of unequal electoral laws, which were still oriented on the representation of different groups' interests. The article shows that, in the mentioned conditions, there was no influence of modernization level, literacy, religion, and social status on the election results, which is explained by the electoral laws and the control of the authorities. Only the factors determined by the electoral laws or flowing from them had a direct impact on the election results. These were the norms of representation, membership to certain social stratum, and land owning. The author concludes on the possibility of using the geo-information technologies in studying the elections in the last imperial period of Russia and demonstrates that GIS-systems can be an adequate instrument for visualization and analysis in such research.

   UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HISTORY
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Libya; Italy; colonialism
AB The article examines the issue of the formation of Libya's modern borders under Italy's colonial rule. The study is based on the analysis and summary of data from Italian archives, intergovernmental agreements, and other documents. The Ottoman Empire, as the sovereign of Libyan territories was not strongly interested in expanding, or fixing the Saharan boundaries of Libya. The article examines the colonial policies of France and Britain in their colonies which surrounded the Ottoman territories of Tripoli and Cyrenaica. It demonstrates how critical events, such as the Fashoda crisis, underpinned the evolving discussion among European states which informed their policies in Saharan Africa. Italy was a late-comer to colonial politics among European nations, and even before it began the conquest of Libya, it began to pursue a policy designed to deter potential European competitors from encroaching on what successive Italian governments viewed as a future colony. France and Britain were inclined to acquiesce to this state of affairs. Accordingly, while Libya was an Ottoman territory, Italy and France had already negotiated an agreement that regulated its borders. Following the conquest of Libya by Italy, the question of Libyan borders became even more intimately connected to that of European politics in general. It was during this period that the key treaties between Italy, France, and Britain, which delineate Libya's borders to this day were signed. Italy's alliance with France and Britain during the First World War led to the signing of the Treaty of London in 1915, which promised Italy territorial compensation in the colonies, in the event that it did not take possession of any former German colonies. This created a political context in which France and Britain found it was acceptable to resolve border uncertainties in Italy's favour. Via this process, Libya's border with Algeria was drawn up in a manner that was more advantageous to the Italian side and the Sarr triangle was transferred from Anglo-Egyptian Sudan to Libya. Due to changes in the European political climate, which took place in the 1930's such as the rise of Italian revisionism and German Nazism, the two Western allies - France and Britain, formulated a policy known as appeasement (though the origins of this policy can be found earlier). As part of this policy of appeasement, the French foreign minister, Pierre Laval negotiated an agreement with Benito Mussolini, which called, among other things, for the transfer of a part of French Equatorial Africa (today's Chad) to Libya - the so-called Aouzou strip. The treaty, due to its unpopularity in France and its inadequacy in Italian eyes, was not ratified and thus did not enter into force, but Italy did not abandon its attempts to secure the Aouzou strip.

AB The research problem addressed by this article is the causes for negative Russia's image in the U. S. and its subsequent worsening. The research methods applied by the author include: firstly, the analysis of public opinion in the U. S. (Pew Research Center polls, Gallup, etc.); secondly, the analysis of American media (TV networks - ABC, CNN, CBS, NBC, Fox News; newspapers - The Washington Post, The New York Times, The Washington Times, The Wall Street Journal; Internet media - the Huffington Post, BuzzFeed, Politico, etc.); thirdly, the analysis of foreign lobbies (Russian, Polish, Latvian, Lithuanian, Estonian, Georgian, Ukrainian, etc.); fourthly, the analysis of Russia's domestic and foreign policies and their ramifications for its image in the U. S. (foreign policies - Russia's conflict relations with Ukraine and Georgia; domestic policies - human rights violations, Chechen war in 1990s, Russia's government default in 1998, etc.). The theory tested by the author is comprised of the following concepts: the dependent variable is Russia's image in the U. S. (as measured by the Pew Research Center from 2007 to 2015), independent variables are Russia's above mentioned domestic and foreign policies (endogenous factor), the American public opinion, the American media, foreign lobbies (exogenous factors). The hypothesis of the research is that Russia's image in the U. S. is mainly influenced by endogenous factors. The finding of the research is that the above mentioned dependent variable is influenced mainly by certain types of endogenous factors like the mismatch in political regimes and the level of conflict (domestic and international).

TI NOOBIOGEOCENOSIS AS A MODEL OF THE CULTURAL LANDSCAPE IN THE FUTURE

DE circumpolar regions of the Earth; noobiogeocenosis; noobiogeosphere;
   noobiogeospheric personality; cultural landscape; stability; optimality;
   self-organization; mutual complementarily; integration of mankind
AB The influence of modern people's activity on the environment leads to non-equilibrium and irreversible damage. Industrial and innovative landscapes create a lot of new problems for humans and interact with traditional landscapes very badly. These problems are particularly evident in the circumpolar zones of the world where there are weak mechanisms of self-cleaning of air and water. Rates chemical and biological inactivation of toxicants, arriving in northern ecosystems, is slowed down considerably. These regions of the Earth can be seen as polygons for testing of advanced scientific models uniting within it natural, artificial and information phenomenon. Peoples that live in the circumpolar territories have special medical, biological and ecological problems that lead to sharp change in character of a food, susceptibility to diseases. These peoples are tending to conservative way of life, preferring "spiritual" to "material" with relatively simple cultural landscapes. However, the organization of simple cultural landscapes is a difficult and complex problem and leads to the need explore of the philosophical, cultural, political and sociological questions. Development of the noobiogeospheric class of sciences helps protect the lifestyle of the northern people, to preserve of their cultural diversity and multi-ethnicity. All of these studies are carried out in the interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary field of modern knowledge. The concept of noobiogeocenosis as the basis of the circumpolar landscape correlates well with the strategy of northern Russia. This is an international strategy closely linked to the geographical picture of the world, and requires both the natural sciences and humanities research methods. At the same time, systematic and synergetic approach complements the analysis codes and chronotopes of the circumpolar culture. Additionally, it is necessary to create a new world based on the concepts of "noobiogeospheric personality", "noospheric mankind" as parts of noobiogeosphere. The network of these concepts will contribute to real harmonious integration of humanity, preserving the identity and diversity of its cultures.

DE social organization; scientific school; management; sociology; labor
   collective; environmental factors; human potential; socio-technical

AB The article considers Moscow Sociological School of the 1960s-1970s, which originated on the basis of the research project "Social Organization" developed by talented Moscow sociologists and philosophers. Under the leadership of N.I. Lapin, they made a methodological breakthrough that was not correctly understood at that time and is still underestimated. The concept "labor collective" used by the overwhelming majority of Soviet scientists to describe personnel of an industrial enterprise or a working team had a huge ideological potential and was politically engaged. This concept helped not to ex-plain the empirical data, but rather to demonstrate the high socialist morality of the working class and its solidarity with the leading party cell. The sector for the study of labor collectives was established in 1968, and in 1969 it was transformed into a department focusing on the world science achievements. Due to the thorough study of such innovations, the concept "labor collective" gradually evolved into a more fruitful and promising concept "social organization". Such a methodological move allowed to use the system approach that was popular at that period, to rely on the findings of Western sociology, mainly on the structural-functional analysis, and on the motivational models of social interaction developed in management. In just five years, participants of the project conducted 28 empirical studies of 100 objects. The total number of respondents was about 25 thousand. The list of publications of the project participants consists of 35 mono-graphs, 10 thematic collections and more than 50 articles (more than 600 publications in total). The team of scientists was dismissed for political reasons.

SO MGIMO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE future; dynamics of knowledge; security; longitudinal-scenario method;
   strategic prognosis; factors of development; scenario of development;
   humanistic turn; ruling elite
AB The article deals with the dynamics of knowledge about the future, factors that determine the need for its "rediscovery" today, among which: the transition of mankind to the dominance of non-linear development; the destruction by globalization of the natural boundaries of civilizational formations, which led to direct interaction of local human civilizations and new conflicts between them; the formation of a unified socio-techno-natural reality; the emergence of complex systems potentially predisposed to the production of catastrophes disasters. This forced scientists to form new models of the future and, accordingly, to develop other theoretical and methodological tools of social forecasting on the basis of whichscenarios of the medium-term (up to 2025) and long-term (up to 2050) visions of the international and military political situation are proposed.
   The authors proceed from the assumption that the validity of these scenarios and the confidence in the knowledge of security should emerge from a comprehensive account of the main stable and variable factors that determine and form the scenarios of Russia's development in these periods. The most suitable method for long-term forecasting is the longitudinal- scenario method which is based on the creation of a model of a probable scenario of the international and military political situation. In order to accomplish this goal, the model needs a large empirical array of information that is analyzed in several stages by taking into account the influence of the main objective groups of factors that ultimately makes it possible to single out and justify three strategic directions of ensuring Russia's security in the twenty-first century. The article comes to conclusion that future scenarios of Russia's development depend on subjective factors such as the quality and intentions of the ruling political elite.

DT Article
DE M. Gorshkov; Russia; sociological exploring survey data;
   interdisciplinary and contextual approaches; socio-humanitarian
   expertise; strategic development of society; humanitarian ends; future
AB The author of this article shows that many Russian and foreign sociologists believe the main function of sociology is the diagnostics of the society and offer tools for its analysis. In this context, the exclusive theoretical and methodological tools of sociological diagnosis developed by Mikhail Gorshkov, a full member of RAS, occupy a special place and combine interdisciplinary and contextual approaches. Their application made it possible to obtain valid results of real conditions of Russia over the past quarter of a century, on the basis of which a forecast of its future is given taking into account the current global and national realities. M. Gorshkov proposes a rethinking of the Russian development strategy along with its reorientation on the realization of socio-economic tasks and on the achievement of the humanitarian goals of social development. Accordingly, new management is in demand including an essential social and humanitarian component of the development and the reproduction of social and human capital on the basis of highly developed areas of science, culture, and education. The diagnostics tools identify and justify the means of optimizing the social life of Russians. These means include: socio-humanitarian expertise; the conditions for free activity of individuals; national version of the democratic system ensuring the reproduction of social trust in political institutions; the establishment of education as a means to meet the challenges of Russia; humanization of the economy aimed at building social and human capital. According to the M. Gorshkov's sociological diagnostics, the Russian society has become complex, more differentiated and multi-layered with a permanent process of technological and socio-cultural renewal; actually, the Russians formed their awareness of belonging to the European and the Eurasian worlds.

DT Article
DE Nicholas I; foreign policy; international relations; diplomacy; Russia;

AB The article is devoted to the successes and failures of Russian foreign policy during the reign of Nicholas I. The key sources of the research are memoires of people who were in close attendance on the Emperor, foreign diplomats, travelers and members of European royal families. They noted some traits of his personality, political views, commitment to order and military service. They left valuable remembrance about all important foreign-policy cases the Russian Emperor was involved in: Russo-Turkish War (1828-1829), contacts with the Balkan states, Eastern Question within the framework of the Russian role in the course of events of the Egyptian-Ottoman War (1832-1833); hostility against French Revolutions and contacts with the allied Prussia and the Austrian Empire.
   These reminiscences make it possible to discover the attitude of Nicolas I to the European revolutions in the first half of 19th and illegitimate monarchs in Europe. They let us track the way the foreign policy influenced the Russian inner policy. The sources are very informative to explain the different steps of Russian foreign policy in the most important areas - in the Middle East, in Europe and in Turkey.

DT Article
DE power; emperor; army; Valerianus; Gallienus; Ingenuus; Regalianus.
AB To the middle third century the negative consequences of the aggressive provincial policy of Roman Empire especially vividly appeared. Political instability and loss of the authority of emperor authority became the aggravating factor. The distrust of the proteges of Valerianus to Gallienus, dissatisfaction with his policy, probably, became the reasons for separate moods in the legions and provinces. As the conventional point of view both in the antique authors and in some contemporary researchers, it is considered that the rebellions on Danube were the beginning of the separate tendencies in the Western provinces. However, uprising Ingenuus occurred considerably earlier than capture of emperor Valerianus, which, as is known, was occasion for uprisings of deputies. With the examination of facts, it becomes understandable that revolt of Ingenuus and Regalianus did not have as a goal to separate from the Roman Empire of territory, but they were caused by more subjective reasons and bore purely local nature.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE postmulticulturalism; multiculturalism; interculturalism; globalization;
   migration; culture; nation state
AB Postmulticulturalism is a way to conceptualize social and cultural diversity under the globalization. Unlike multiculturalism that developed as a nation-state project postmulticulturalism considers the tendencies of fluidity, processuality, and overcoming institutional constellations and national boundaries. Postmulticulturalism allows a specific vision of contemporary problems, thus contributing to the understanding of the role and functions of the nation state under the globalization, to the redefining of integration in national and transnational contexts, and to the transition to dialogue forms of maintaining social and political unity within the nation. Thereafter the authors consider a `postmulticultural turn' in social sciences, which is associated with managing cultural diversity and allows the nation state to rethink itself in the postmulticultural perspective. Postmulticulturalism contributes to the development of new conceptual and discursive spaces, and to the practical explications of the changing reality under the recurrent transitions between old and new, the past and the future. Postmulticulturalism is a stage in the development of a multicultural ideology aimed at deessentialization of ethnicity and overcoming cultural discrimination. However, it does not deny multiculturalism as a way to conceptualize new social and cultural realities and migration situation in nation states that are supported by various multicultural policies and provide the postmulticultural approach with the impulses for social and cultural dynamics relevant for the contemporary society.

DE 19th century; history of Russian public thought; liberalism;

AB The article is dedicated to the 75th anniversary of Vladimir Kitaev, Doctor of historical sciences, first Dean of the Faculty of History at the Volgograd State University. Today V. Kitaev is a recognized expert on the history of Russian public thought and Professor of the Nizhny Novgorod State University. The article focuses on one of the most important, in the author's opinion, outcome of long-term V. Kitaev's studies of the history of Russian public thought of the 19th century -identifying the attempts of synthesis of its main directions: liberal, socialist, conservative. The desire for this synthesis was expressed by representatives of various trends of public thought, who wanted to avoid the revolutionary upheavals. V. Kitaev notes intertwining of both elements of liberalism and conservatism from M. Shcherbatov, who stood at the origins of Russian conservatism. In the pursuit of one of the ideologues of Russian liberalism, K. Kavelin reconciled the assumptions of Slavophilism and Westernism. V. Kitaev rightly saw a reflection of the heterogeneity of its ideological positions, representing a complex set of liberal and conservative elements. Taking into account the political and ideological self-evaluations of B. Chicherin ("guarding" liberalism), V. Kitaev proposed to consider him as a thinker and publicist, liberal-conservative centre left free to drift in the coordinate system. As shown by a scholar, a strong influence of socialist ideas was determined by the position of the liberal Vestnik Evropy ('Herald of Europe'), the historical justice of which demands to put the formation of social liberalism in Russia in the beginning. The share of Russia is already fallen revolutions "from below" and revolutions " from above". The Ways of Russian thought by V. Kitaev leads to a synthesis of the best intellectual legacy that we inherited from the nineteenth century. Maybe this is the way to our national reconciliation and unity.

German colleagues particularly dwell on the Tyulpanov's activities in the post-war Germany in the Department of Information (SMAD). After the World War II he happened to be one of the founders of the Russian-German friendship and cooperation, who has become a legend of Eastern and Western Germany. The essential part of the paper is dedicated to Tjulpanov as the Teacher and distinguished scientist-ideologist, the founder of the Modern Capitalism Economy Department. Studying social science including economics, history, philosophy, etc. he was committed to what was called "Marxist-Leninist theory of social development", trying to get reed of frozen ideological norms and in this format to offload from dogmatism educating students, who took his example in the invisible moral status "overflow" into the professional activityand vice versa.

DE Urals regionalism; industrialization; regional policy; the Ural region;

AB The activity of the Ural party-state leader in 1928-1937 years Ivan Dmitrievich Kabakov is considered. His role in the socialist transformation of the late 1920-ies - middle of 1930-ies is examined in the context of relations between the Centre and regions of the country, manifestations of regionalist trends, characteristics of industrial modernization. The urgency is determined by the appeal to the study of Soviet regional policy in the Urals of examined period through the prism of the interests of the region and assess the value of the personality of the leader of the Ural (Sverdlovsk since 1934) region. The author analyzes the influence of Kabakov initiatives on the development of "horizontal" economic ties. It is reported that he had provided maximum use of internal regional resources for local needs, upholding the positions of the Urals in the face of impending "centralization" of control and accelerated "industrialization." One of the key findings of the study appears to be a statement about the importance of I. D. Kabakov as a political figure and business leader, who was built into the Soviet system of government, but who had considerable personal power, allowed to achieve a major production success that laid the image of the region for decades. Special role of the Urals in the territorial-economic complex of the country is emphasized.

AB The article presents results of systematization and description within the framework of a new data base of audiovisual and various written documents on the history of the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol in late 18th early 21st century. Most of the documents bear upon events of the Crimean and Great Patriotic Wars, economic history of the 20th - early 21st century. Analysis, synthesis, and comparison of data on composition and content of documents from federal and regional archives contends that federal archives hold documentary fonds on military and political events in the Crimea, which are of global importance. Documents of regional archives show citizens' participation in various developments in the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol. Description of the data base posted on the portal of the Russian Society of Historians and Archivists (ROIA) shows that it can be used to research history of the Crimea and Sevastopol. The data base allows addition of new data according to national and international requirements of archival documents description. The article lists main elements of unified description of archival documents: tracking numbers, titles and other filters used in the data base. The data base created as a result studying fonds of federal and regional archives of the Russian Federation, is the first published data base on composition and content of written and film documents on the Crimea and Sevastopol as a part of the Russian state. Thus, the article, and the data base it presents, is of great scientific and practical importance for archival, and also historical studies.

DT Article
DE World Politics; "End of history"; "Clash of civilizations"; migration
   crisis; "End of liberalism"
AB The article compares the forecasts concerning trends in world politics of the early 21st century created by Francis Fukuyama, Samuel Huntington and Immanuel Wallerstein. Though none of the forecasts was completely accurate, all of them spoke of the tendencies that could be later observed in world politics. Despite many experts criticized Fukuyama's concept of the 'end of history', Western elites had been making foreign policies of their countries in accordance with the concept until recently. The article explains how such policies came to contradict contemporary state of affairs. In accordance with Huntington's expectations, the role of civilizational factor in world politics of the early 21st century significantly grew compared to previous periods. However, the character of civilizational factor's influence on political processes appeared to be different compared to what Huntington expected. The article underlines the accuracy of Wallerstein's forecast concerning the consequences of mass South-North migration. At the same time, the article concludes, his forecast, likewise the other two, also requires adaptation to contemporary situation in societal development.

TI G20 Priorities and Decisions under Turkey's 2015 Presidency:

   development cooperation
AB Turkey held the presidency of the G20 (Group of 20) from December 2014 to November 2015. During this period geopolitical tensions started to spread beyond the borders of the regions involved. Turkey went through a challenging time, with a slowing economy, two elections in 2015, revived political confrontations, two million refugees and frustrations in securing its borders and handling terrorism. Turkey defined three priorities for its presidency: inclusiveness, implementation and investment for growth. To combat inequality and ensure inclusive growth, it aimed to address the issues of small and medium-sized enterprises, such as access to finance, skills and global value chains, employment for youth and women, and support to the development of low-income countries. Inclusiveness was also explicit in G20 engagement with social partners. Implementation was emphasized, particularly related to the imperative to deliver on the G20 members' commitments regarding growth strategies made at the 2014 Brisbane Summit.
   This article assesses the G20's performance under the Turkey presidency within a functional paradigm focusing on the three main objectives of plurilateral summitry institutions: strengthening capacity for political leadership to launch new ideas and overcome deadlocks, reconciling domestic and international pressures, and consolidating collective management. To attain those objectives, institutions are expected to demonstrate leadership, solidarity, sustainability, acceptability, consistency and continuity. Efficiency is perceived as G20 performance on a combination of the criteria. Given the G20's ultimate mission to achieve strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth, all the issues on Turkey's G20 agenda were grouped according to these four growth pillars.
   G20 performance on each of the issue areas was assessed on six criteria using a three-point scale: high (1), medium (0) and low (-1) degree of performance. The overall assessment of G20 performance efficiency was estimated as the total of the average scores in each issue area divided by 11 (the number of policy areas on the agenda). Recognizing that implementation is crucial to G20 legitimacy, leadership and solidarity, Turkey made it one of its presidency's priorities. Thus, the quality of accountability and level of compliance are considered within each policy area. The quality of engagement is included in the assessment of the acceptability of G20 decisions within respective policy areas, with the format of G20 engagement with outreach, including social partners, international institutions and non-G20 countries, explored in a separate section.
   The analysis showed that the G20 under the Turkish presidency attained a high level of consistency and continuity in all issues, ensuring the consistency of decisions across policy areas and their compatibility with the agenda of previous presidencies and G20 core agenda. Sustainability and acceptability were also quite high, as the G20 ensured the longevity of collectively produced solutions and got the endorsement of the decisions by other governments, international institutions and social partners. However, the Turkish presidency lacked leadership, showing not enough capacity to exercise political authority and overcome deadlocks, which could be partly explained by the challenges of the internal situation in Turkey. The lowest level was registered for solidarity as some G20 members did not fully commit to certain decisions and parts of the programs and documents were perceived as voluntary. The G20 displayed many of the features of plurilateral summitry institutions in all the areas under the goal of balanced growth and almost all with regard to the goal of inclusive growth. On sustainable growth, the performance was mixed on both energy and climate change. With a relatively high average for strong growth, the outcomes by issue were uneven: relatively high on macroeconomic cooperation and investment, and rather low on trade. The trade agenda was the only one with negative scores for leadership and solidarity, proving to be one of the most persistent challenges for the G20.

DE informal economy; Political Science; constructivist approach
AB E.Leontyeva highly praises S.Barsukova's book and believes that the book is extremely useful for political scientists who are trying to understand the organization of political reality that falls outside the sphere of attention of the traditional Political Science. The book is organized as a series of essays devoted to the most famous concepts of informality. It represents an independent composition that puts all analyzed researchers and their ideas into a single semantic field rather than a mere collection of reviews. The author treats this semantic field as a panoramic vision of the informal economy, in which individual fragments, sorted out on the basis of the reviewed books, become the fundamental "bricks" of the construction. As a result, we can see the gradual "manifestation" of informality, which is usually hidden not only from the eyes of a man in the street or a policy maker, but also those of a researcher.

AB The concept of linguistic ecology appeared a few years ago and has already gained its status within the conceptual and terminological system of the Russian language, which currently deals with the evolution of linguistic and cultural values in general. Unfortunately, the concepts of aggression and aggressiveness become ever more popular these days within all fields of human life. People get used to a negative communicative portrait. In this regard, the task of linguistic ecology is to preserve cultural environment and the Russian language as its integral part, to develop and acquire other linguistic preferences for native speakers, especially younger generation, to focus on language ideals, to make people value the acquired linguistic traditions, and as a result, to introduce positive changes in the society, the communication process, and the system of values as such. This is possible only in the context of competently pursued effective language policy. Especially, if this refers to a multicultural and multiethnic region such as the North Caucasus. The issue of linguistic accuracy and political correctness is extremely relevant. The situation of ethnoconflict tension can change considerably under the influence of several factors. Incorrect words or publications in mass media may contribute to ethnic tensions. Therefore, taking into account the above-mentioned facts, one may conclude that the role of linguistic ecology is undoubtedly important.

DT Article
DE Orthodoxy; truth; politics; democracy
AB The article analyzes the statements of Russian Orthodox church (ROC) officials of the Moscow Patriirchate applying methods of political conceptology and in-depth reading. They allow to discover those moments in the bodys of intellectual-politically significant books that are not taken into account or consciously dispensed with in their formal perceptions and canonical interpretations. The linguistic, semantic and ideological structure of public speech is described taking into account the general properties of political language and specifics of their manifestation in the political history of Russia. The problem of reproduction of the opposition between truth and politics in modern Russia is. posed. To analyze it, modern forms of conflict between the political and legal approach to the design of court trials are described and the measures of individual, group, social, national and institutional collaboration with government bodies in Russia are revealed. This measure determines the cognitive and social preconditions for a chain of lies and cynicism, on which collaboratism is based in relation to the existing power. It cultivates thinking in the style of raison d'etat (the state mind), which before met only in the field of foreign affairs and in situations of direct and undoubted threat. This is the basis of state propaganda. As a result, the web of deception became all-common, and the international conflict boomerangs to the scene of domestic politics. The controversial nature of the cognitive-evaluation matrix of American Russian studies is described. A contradiction has been stated between the fundamentalism and creativity that has developed in the ROC over the past hundred years. It is directly related to the modern ROC. The problem consists in comprehending those directions of Orthodox thought that allow us to describe the historical drama of Orthodoxy and discover in it the prerequisites for realizing the relationship between Orthodoxy and the democracy.

DT Article
DE liberalism; Westernism; image of liberalism; discursive construction of
   mass perceptions
AB The article analyses the process of discursive construction of the image of "liberalism" in post-Soviet Russia. In accordance with the reputational approach, liberals are defined as those who call themselves liberal or cast as such by contemporaries. Based on the analysis of texts written by "liberals" and their critics, O.Malinova proves that the crisis that liberalism faces today is partly a consequence of its original mould of the 1990s. In the modern Russia liberalism is strongly associated with Westernism, obsession with the market economic reforms, paternalist approach to the illiberal majority, criticism of the authoritarian regime and renunciation of imperial ambitions. In the context of the political and ideological shifts of the 2000s and especially 2010s, this configuration of "initial" constructions played a fatal role in the formation of a negative image of liberalism in the eyes of Russians.

AB The study presents basic principles of the event analysis developed for the purpose of improving the forecasting of market conditions. The aim of the study is to create the theoretical foundations of the event analysis of the stock market and their empirical substantiation. This type of analysis will make it possible to take into consideration the general trends in the stock market more comprehensively. For this purpose, the authors present the mathematical tools of the study, disclose the theoretical basis and genesis of the method proposed. In addition, the article contains the statistical analysis of the stock market performed with the use of traditional statistical methods and with the tools of the event analysis, first of all, the information elasticity. Empirical testing on the data on exchange rates and PFTS and the Ukraine Stock Exchange indices allowed the authors to establish the connection between events and changes in the indices, to identify several cases of excessive response that may be indicative of insider influence. Among the authors most notable for their recent works on this topic it necessary to mention N. Tuma, M. Hannan, O. Humpage and others. In their studies they reveal quite comprehensively the importance of the event analysis for forecasting purposes, the connection of this type of analysis to the hypothesis of market efficiency, its methods and approaches. However, there are several urgent tasks to be solved in this study: discovering the connection between the event and the change in the exchange rate, identifying possible reactions of the market to different types of events, and defining concepts such as event, event profile and event analysis of the stock market. Since economic or political events can influence the behavior of the market during the time period lasting up to several weeks, months, and even years, it is obvious that the use of fundamental analysis is justified only given the long-term forecasting. The value position of the author on the subject consists in enhancing investors' confidence in the domestic stock market, increasing its transparency and, consequently, liquidity. This approach forms the basis for the creation of a new subject area for analyzing the impact of events on stock dynamics.

DT Article
DE Afghanistan; post-Soviet Central Asia; security; crisis; Islamist
   radicalism
AB The paper analyzes the situation in Afghanistan in the context of an acute regional crisis developing there, with an active involvement of external forces in it. In addition, the author focuses on problems of regional security in the post-Soviet Central Asian states. Threats, risks and challenges coming to Central Asia from Afghanistan are estimated in detail. Special attention is paid to the activities of radical Islamist movements and transnational terrorist organizations, notably the ISIS's "Afghan branch" - the so-called "Khorasan caliphate". Russia's new approaches to the problem of the Afghan settlement are evaluated through the prism of its efforts to maintain security in Central Asian states and to reduce tensions in the region. Taking into account the problem raised above, the paper seeks conditions under which the cooperation of the Russian Federation with China and other countries involved will contribute to a peaceful transition in Afghanistan and will affect the process of achieving Central Asian regional stability. Summarizing what has been said, we should take note the fact of unfolding a new level of competition in Asia. The involvement of Afghanistan and its Central Asian neighbors into the regional political processes is becoming more evident, although the positive potential of such interaction is not always visible. As the unipolar world is fading and the polycentric world order becomes stronger, countries of Central Asia and South Asia can take advantage of the chance that has arisen for them to become a unifying center of Asia leaving aside the mediation of non-regional powers. In this context, it seems logical to form a cooperative security system with participation of the CSTO and the SCO. It will allow Russia, China, Central Asian states and their allies in Asia to address effectively the issues related to Asian security.

AB The study focuses on a very important historiographical and methodological problem, because the accuracy of the source base and scientific literature has always been a cornerstone issue in the course of historical research of any scale. The relevance of the subject is determined by its high significance to the social sciences, primarily economics, history and political science. It is argued that the materials of the statistical surveys of family budgets of the population represent a unique source of information. It is stated that the data of budget surveys impartially indicate the true level of income, expenditure and consumption of the population, giving scientists the opportunity to reconstruct an objective picture of our past, free from ideological blinders and propaganda cliches. It is proved that some errors and inaccuracies found in the materials of budget surveys in no way can affect a very positive assessment of their reliability. It is emphasized that these materials had not originally intended for wide publicity and discussion, which makes unlikely their deep and deliberate falsification as a systematic phenomenon. Scientific novelty of the work lies in the fact that it systematizes, generalizes and presents exclusive material pertaining to budget research on the example of Sverdlovsk region.

It is argued that in the USSR at the level of state secrets any information about the income of the party functionaries and their privileges intentionally suppressed, as well as the information on the financial activities of the Communist party in general. It is proved that the Communist party completely disposed the finances not only belonged to it, but also the resources of the whole country using them in its own purposes, for example, to finance the deficit of budget of the party. It is declared that the revenue and expenditure budgetary activities of regional party organizations had their own interesting characteristics, studying of which allows to expand the framework of our understanding of their functioning. It is emphasized that the party budget of regional committee of the party was rather arbitrary category and had primarily control and audit function.

The study is conducted on the material of several archives: State Archive of Sverdlovsk Region, Archive of the Territorial body of Federal State Statistics Service and the Center of documentation of public organizations of Sverdlovsk region. This allowed the author to develop and present his own concept of the research topic. The topic urgency is due to its high relevance to the social siences, primarily to history, economics, sociology and political science. Scientific novelty of the work is seen in the fact that the new material discovered by the author in these archives is introduced into scientific usage. It is stated that the analysis of money expenses of citizens is an important direction of research in the sphere of material conditions of their lives. It is alleged that during the whole researched period, the leading role in the structure of costs of family budgets of the population of Sverdlovsk oblast played the costs of purchasing food, and expenditures on the acquisition of clothes and shoes were the second in importance. It is proved that the expenditure on cultural and educational needs during this period were negligible in the workers and employees. It is emphasized that the highest level of expenditure (and income) had families of engineering-technical workers of the regional center. It is declared that the class of industrial workers officially positioned in the country as hegemonic class according to its actual position in the USSR actually was not a class of such kind, judging by the level of its expenditures.

DT Article
DE "Soviet nobility"; system of values; emigration; opposition; terror;
   adaptation
AB The issues addressed in the article are of particular relevance for the contemporary historiography due to the absence of systematic studies on the history of the "Soviet nobility" and their adaptation to the Soviet realities. An especially interesting aspect of this topic is the transformation of values and worldview of the nobility in the conditions of the dominant communist ideology.
   The article presents a comprehensive analysis of the nobility survival in the period of establishment of a totalitarian political regime and destruction of the traditional Russian system of values and religious traditions. The primary research method used to address the topic is the micro-historical analysis, which allowed the authors to obtain the following results: a typology of this social group was developed (involuntary or deported emigrants, open or hidden oppositionists, and those who were forced to adapt), based on characterization of beliefs, values and patterns of behaviour of individual representatives of the "former" nobility; oppressive measures used by the Soviet power against the "exploiters" were classified into several types: economic oppression, legal restrictions, ideological pressure and direct terror; and specific features of their adaptation to the Soviet realities, including its ethno-confessional aspect, were identified. The main conclusion drawn from the research is that the nobiliary culture and system of values proved extremely resistant to various challenges and threats of the Soviet epoch. Materials of this article have both theoretical and practical implications in the context of actualisation of the culture of mansions, nobiliary traditions and the cadet education in today 's Russia.

DE Mexican organized crime; drug cartels; illegal immigration; drug
   traffic; US-Mexican relations
AB The article describes the problem of organized crime in modern Mexico. It addresses the activities of criminal clans, which profoundly evolved since the 1930s. The US-Mexican extensive border length and the stable demand for drugs in the United States leads to the continuous flow of illegal migrants and drugs from Mexico to the US and American firearms back to Mexico. First, the authors address the issue of interconnectedness of crime in the neighboring countries. Second, they describe the geographical distribution of crime activity. It shows the influence of organized crime on the political life oin Mexico and ways of its adaptation to law enforcement pressure, namely division and disaggregation.
   The authors state that the fight against organized crime was ineffective in Mexico in 2006-2012, because it ignored political and cultural realities, it used exclusively force and almost did not involve civil society. In addition, it only increased the level of violence in the country and contributed to the growth of corruption in the ranks of law enforcement. Moreover, it increased the level of violence in the country and contributed to the growth of corruption in the ranks of law enforcement. Many of its components had a pronounced << pre-election >> character, aimed at attracting the voter with the promise of an << early and decisive victory >> over criminals.
   The article proposes new approach to the problem of organized crime in Mexico. To start with, government should refuse to use unilateral, as well as politicized and opportunistic actions. The involvement of civic society is of ultimate importance.

DE revolution; power; violence; people; opposition; democracy; the February
   Revolution; the October Revolution
AB The Russian Revolution of 1917 went down in history as yet another classic example (after the French Revolution) of the general logic of the unfolding of the revolutionary process, starting with the proclamation of liberty and equality (in February) and ending with one-party dictatorship and terror (in October). The present article argues that the common cause of all revolutions is the absence of a legal and legitimate means of obtaining power by the political opposition. This forces the opposition to resort to force, even armed methods of capturing power, which in turn generates a new cycle of violence, sometimes exceeding the previous one. The only alternative to this development of events is the democratic procedure of free elections, which allows those fighting for power to shift from an illegal to a legal opposition, and thereby transform themselves from professional revolutionaries into professional politicians.

AB The issue is devoted to the Crimea and Sevastopol city accession to the Russian Federation. The economic effects of the Crimean territorial policy of the Russian government are considered. The assumption is made that the occurrence of the Crimea in the economic and legal space of the Russian Federation has included significant investment. Meanwhile, it is worth far less than the prospect of Crimea to share the fate of modern Ukraine. The article considers the political consequences of Crimea's integration into Russia. From the authors' point of view this integration was an important event in world politics that significantly changed the field of international relations and "rules of the game'. It has been revealed how events in Crimea have changed the vector of development of Russian policy in the context of domestic life and in the international community. It is shown that the integration of the Crimea becomes an important figure in Russian political discourse, linking the foreign and domestic policies of modern Russia. This underlines the seriousness of the Crimean agenda in the public consciousness. The accession of Crimea and Sevastopol City into the Russian Federation has allowed the ruling elite of modern Russia make the best use of opportunities for their own legitimization.

AB This paper focuses on different ways of the "alien" representation in the Russian and German media discourse based on essentials of cultural and discourse linguistics. Most research thus far has focused on the media text rather than on media uses and practices. With references to the political and social contexts, it will be demonstrated how the opposition "own-alien" is effectively used for supporting national consciousness and identity. The "own-alien" polarization has a variable base: on the international level - Russia vs. ideological opposite state; on the national level - authority vs. ordinary folk, locals vs. migrants etc. The analysis of Russian and German press articles over the period from 2013 to 2017 has shown that the most dominating foreignization strategy in the both media discourses is the strategy of alienation. For a more comprehensive research, the study material was broken up into two categories: a national and an international media discourses. As a result, the most popular tactics and communicative turns of the alienation strategy representation were exposed in the both media discourses, as well as the specific character of the "alien" verbalization in different cultures was described. The discourse and contrastive analysis of Russian and German newspaper texts is used as the research method.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE Far East; macroeconomic trends; institutions; autonomation; integration;
   economic growth; development; East Asia
AB The article considers macroeconomic trends in the development of the economic complex in the Russian Far East. We explore the interaction of dynamic and structural parameters of reproduction and the specifics and regularities of promising modernization in the region. We analyze how the regional economy responds to various types of institutional impacts, and study the features of regional governmental economic policy in the east of the Russian Federation. We consider trends in external and internal impacts of economic, institutional, military and political nature. We describe formation regularities and assess sustainability trends. The aim of our research is to find the answer to the question about the possibilities and ways of transforming the socio-economic system of the Far East in accordance with the current national geo-economic paradigm. We prove that the best results in the development of the Far East were achieved in those periods when non-economic goals of the state were combined with the use of centralized material and financial resources of the state for the purpose of generating intra-regional economic and financial resources based on the support provided by government to the institutional environment that should be as comfortable as possible for the formation of endogenous reproduction within the region. We confirm a hypothesis that we have previously formulated in our joint publications; the hypothesis is that the periods when the state was pursuing exclusively "colonial" goals of getting the maximum possible utility from the region at a minimal support at the expense of governmental resources of endogenous drivers of development were the least successful from the point of view of maintaining stable socioeconomic dynamics in the region. We discuss the correlation between endogenous and cumulative regional economic growth in conditions when the importance of institutional framework generated at both federal and regional levels is increasing. We show that the modern period of institutional innovations in the field of regional economic development has the following specific feature: it combines "colonial" exploitation of transit and natural resource utilities of the region with the restoration of creating a diversified economic complex. The analysis of development trends in the region over the past 10 years shows that centralized financial resources are being substituted with institutional incentives; this may lead to an increase in the terms of building the capacity for endogenous development of the region's economy and make its results less predictable.

TI EVERYDAY LIFE OF INTERNEES IN KAZAN PROVINCE IN 1917
SO RUDN JOURNAL OF RUSSIAN HISTORY
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Kazan province; internees; everyday life; the February Revolution; the
   1917 Bolshevik Revolution
AB In the article the situation of internees(persons having the nationality of a hostile state) is analyzed on the example of the Kazan province in 1917. Analyzing the rights and duties of the prisoners, the author equates their status to that of administrative exiles and gives moral evaluation to the phenomenon of internment. To illustrate the particular situation of the internees in the crisis year for Russia, the author refers to the earlier period of their lives in the Kazan province - from 1914 to 1916. The forced displacement from their homes entailed separation from family, inability to find jobs in their specialty, restriction of freedom of movement, prohibition of communication with the local population. The revolutionary year of 1917 was marked, on the one hand, by general liberalization which affected, among others, the civilian prisoners. On the other hand, the economic problems in the country provoked the province residents' anger with foreigners. Thus, because of food shortages and economic disruption, the domestic problems only worsened, the internees couldn't choose the place of residence and the expectations of easing of the internment regime were not met. The new public authorities - Public Security Committees - treated foreigners in general and internees in particular with caution and tried to curtail their rights. This led to the fact that even the citizens of neutral states were persecuted. After the 1917 October Revolution this mistrust continued. As a result, regardless of the fact which political force was in power, the fate of the internees did not become easier, even after such a strong social upheaval as the February and October Revolutions.

DE right for a lie; freedom; degrees of independence; Kant; trap for
   freedom; stereotype; public risks
ID KANT
AB The article deals with the urgent moral and legal problem of the right for a lie in a new world outlook context namely as a trap for human freedom. The presented author's interpretation of degrees of freedom as stages of development of independence of the person gives a social and ethical assessment of a practical phenomenon of the right for a lie. The author analyses various negative aspects of application of this phenomenon in modern public life and shows essential restrictions which people face with when they use the right for a lie. This analysis is based on theoretical model of the matrix of traditional consciousness assuming three-level structure of the public relations. It is under construction from the first - the ideological level of the highest (moral and religious) meanings, to the second level - political and legal rules and installations, and then to the third level - social and economic and psychological practices of behavior. The author revealed negative aspects of use of the right for a lie at the second and third levels of a matrix. At the second level subordinated to the principle "the end justifies the means" negative consequences will be: paternalism, moral utopianism and legal nihilism. At the third level - mass falsity, mistrust, unsociability and social apathy will belong to the public risks connected with use of the right for a lie. Thus, the right for a lie keeps human freedom at the level of social and biological survival and interferes with transition of the person and society to higher degrees of freedom independence. For transition to new degrees of freedom it is necessary to establish, first, an origin and borders of use of the right for a lie, namely its need and efficiency only in extreme conditions of survival of the person and society (usually, in military conditions). Upon transition of society to peaceful, safe life "the right for a lie" turns into a dangerous stereotype, into the real trap for practical mind which constrains development of human freedom. Secondly, in modern peace conditions it is necessary to limit by law use of the right for a lie by strict and specific conditions of public safety and a narrow circle of public officials. Under these conditions the possibility of further democratic development of all society, and bigger free self-realization of citizens remains.

AB Prince Mstislav Mstislavich Toropetskiy (Udaloy) played a prominent role in the history of Russia, participating in three fateful battles of his time: Lipitsa battle, Battle of the Nations in Galic and the Battle of the Kalka. But despite the personal courage and leadership talent military victory Mstislav turned into a political, defeat. National historiography sees this as the fault of Mstislav himself, who, instead of strengthening the gains achieved, rushed about in search of military glory. However, it does not take into account that due to its position in the princely hierarchy, Mstislav was not an independent politician, but only represented the interests of his suzeraines Rostislavich.

AB The article provides a new interpretation of the causes of the Lena Execution in 1912 in the light of personal memoirs of P.N. Demin, an eye-witness of those far-off events. Memoirs have been recorded and annotated by the authors. The article investigates causes and circumstances of the Lena tragedy. Personal memoirs of an events participant are of a great historical and legal value for Russian science, along with official chronicles of different periods. About 50 years ago one of the authors met P.N. Demin, who had miraculously survived the Lena Massacre. He told how he happened to come to the Lena goldfields. Harsh Siberian nature, backbreaking work, ill-treatment of workers, wretched food and living conditions drove miners beyond endurance. The strike was brought on by sales of uneatable meat. Elected representatives of the mines formulated their demands to the "Lenzoloto" administration for improvement of working and living conditions. When the workers' were demands refused and the elected arrested, a peaceful demonstration of over 3000 came to the Nadezhda mine, where the company office was situated. They were met by soldiers who opened fire on unarmed crowd on the command of the rittmeister of the gendarmerie. About 300 people were killed and as many injured. The news of the Lena tragedy roused revolutionary sentiments in the Russian society, which resulted in further unrest. Official rendering of the Lena Execution causes is fleshed out by valuable intelligence from P.N. Demin's memoirs. The article is accompanied by rare photographs of the Lena events participants.

AB In the history of Russia's development, there are clear, unchanging constants of empire, autocracy, and property as power (property/propertilessness). These are persistent structures that have existed over a long historical period, which are created by the state and society, and are upheld by tradition. On the one hand, they are restrictive, but on the other hand, they guide the direction of socioeconomic, sociopolitical, and cultural development, and also facilitate the emergence of the corresponding social actors (individuals or groups) and institutions. During the Russian revolutionary process, which spanned 1905-1922 and reached its apex in the October Revolution, an attempt was made to change these constants. However, this attempt failed, and Russia returned to its traditional path of development.

DE Mental civilization; tolerance; the Torah; the New Testament; the Koran;
   extremism
AB The article deals with world-view, mental, ideological and political problems that arise when subjects devoted to the foundations of religious cultures are introduced in the curricula of modern secondary schools. Changes are examined that have taken place in the values of the majority of people who, after an era of monotheism, entered a new mental era of "scientific perception of the world", and the processes that lead to religious extremism and terrorism are revealed. The author explains why every mental civilization is marked by its own values, picture of the world, norms and rules of behavior both in communities and in people relations with the external world. Specific examples are used involving such concepts as "friend," "brother,", "neighbor," and "enemy" to reveal the fundamental differences between the values of monotheism and the modern scientific perception of the world. The author demonstrates that the texts of the Scriptures belong to a different mental epoch and can only be applied with serious reservations in present-day conditions when people live according to the norms and rules generated by their independent intellectual activities and enshrined in the constitutions of modern states. The subject studied in the country's secondary and higher education should be the Constitution. Let us not forget that it is not by chance that the Torah is also referred to as The Law (The Law of Moses), the Koran is unthinkable without the Sharia law and the New Testament in the minds of the vast majority of Christians is "the Law."

AB This article discusses authority culture in Ukraine. 'Russian power', i.e. a particular configuration of power relationship that has been prevailing in the Russian, Soviet and post-Soviet empires, is used as a point of reference. Two features of Russian power explain its closeness to violence: mostly negative associations (such as force, money and corruption) and a high power distance. It is argued that a potential movement from violence to power understood as human ability to act in concert exists in Ukraine. Members of Ukraine's subelites have a chance to become a driving force of this process. Under certain conditions they could take a lead in transitioning to less violent models of power in politics and elsewhere. The data were drawn from three mass surveys conducted in Russia (N = 2939 and N = 11,096) and in Ukraine (N = 2040) from July 2016 to January 2017.

AB In the international field, the Baltic states currently elicit basic associations with an anti-Russian irritant, which generally reflects rather foreign than national interests of these countries. However, slogans declaring their independence at the end of 90ies included the goal of giving them maximum political and economic freedom, and were not accomplished. Moreover, they got the polar opposite meaning. As a result, the foreign policy of the Baltic states is subordinated to NATO's strategic direction. Economic development depends on the Nordic countries. The behavior of the Baltic states in the region has one-vector appearance. The development of their economies is increasingly lopsided. All of the above is aimed at their artificial fencing off Russia. The brunt of that stereotype development implementation falls on the population, whose socio-economic status demonstrates a strong downtrend. In general, a comparison between the Baltic states' position within the USSR and its current condition tells against their strategy development and their leaders.

The article also shows the regulatory processes of integration - cultural interactions connected with antialiasing and neutralization of cultural and political conflicts within the considered system. It also analyses the interaction of religion with other elements of culture, national identity, education, a style of life in the cultural and historical process. Orthodox understanding the mission of the Russian Orthodox Church was based on Trinitarian approach. The forms of Orthodox mission in Azov region were: informational mission, apologetic mission, educational mission and external mission. The reasons for increasing the number of "sects" and strengthening their harmful influence in the region are also being under consideration in the article. The documents, kept in the archive of the Mariupol Local History Museum that highlight the concept of multi-model system of inter-confessional relations and show the leading role of the Russian Orthodox Church in the policy of harmonization of interethnic and interfaith relations, are under consideration in the present article.

DT Article
DE Russian language; gender; communicative behaviour; political discourse
AB The study is done within actual direction of modern science - the gender linguistics. The article is devoted to the question of the communicative image of the TV presenters of political talk-show Vladimir Solovyov and Olga Skabeyeva. The results of a comparative analysis of the components of the public image of each media person are presented: appearance, communicative behavior, speech manners. It is shown that Solovyov and Skabeyeva have a bright, catchy, wistful image, and their similarities - leading position, business style in clothes, gestures system, categoricalness - are determined by the program format. It is proved that at the same time, communicative images of the presenters have a specific gender identity: Vladimir Solovyov's image corresponds to stereotypical idea of a real man, while Olga Skabeyeva's image combines both typically female (modesty, elegance, parity) and male characteristics (rationality, rigidity, hardness). Special attention is given to verbal behaviour that detects the individual characteristics of each media person. Vladimir Solovyov's manner of speech can be characterized as assertive, poly-stylistic, management one. The authors argue that the dominant for this presenter is a strategy of self-presentation, while the main intention can be defined as the retention of communicative leadership. The general speech style of Olga Skabeyeva can be described as aggressive, but the presenter purely uses female methods of mitigating the conflict. It is proved that the communicative style of the presenter is not free from gender peculiarities of the personality.

   Organization (NATO); Nikita S. Khrushchev; Leonid I. Brezhnev; Charles
   de Gaulle; Aleksey N. Kosygin
AB The Soviet-French relations in the second half of the 1960s signaled the commencement of detente. One of the grounds for France to develop economic cooperation with the USSR was the French experts' appraisal of the economic reform which was launched by the USSR government in 1965. Their estimates and judgments are fully recorded in documents currently held in the Archive of France's Economy and Finances. Using these documents as historical sources for the first time in French and Russian historiography, the author discloses what the French pundits on soviet economics thought about the 1965 economic reform, its first steps and obstacles as well prospects of its implementation. The documents witness that France closely followed the course of the economic reform carried out by Prime Minister Kosygin anticipating serious changes in the Soviet economic policy, particularly, in foreign trade. The Soviet economy was believed to become more open toward the Western goods and technologies. In this case the French government intended to use its good political ties with the USSR to get France established on the East-European market as a successful competitor of the FRG (Western Germany), even though being skeptical about the long-term prospects and outcomes of the 1965 economic reform. Although the French economists were confident that the mid 1960s was the right time to expand France's economic cooperation with the Soviet Union, they rightly called on the French government to act fast as the situation in the future was likely to change for the worse.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE French historiography of the 21st century; Great Duchy of Burgundy;
   medieval state; medieval nations; alternative history
AB The success of French 'middle-aged' humanities scholars gives rise to surprise. Contrary to the scepsis of elder colleagues, the works of this generation, from Thomas Piketti to Patrick Boucheron, have proved to be in demand. They are not afraid to make mistakes, and this gives them opportunity to answer simple, but at the same time very important questions. Such scientific style is also inherent to Elodie Lecuppre-Desjardin, who has dared to ask why la Grande Principaute de Bourgogne (1363-1477) turned out to be 'unfinished" as a political body. (Lecuppre-Desjardin E.Le Royaume inacheve des ducs de Bourgogne. P.: Belin, 2016.) Her investigation follows a narrow verge between 'finalism' and 'alternative history' (uchronie), without being afraid of posing theoretical questions long disregarded by French historiography. For example, what is a state, and which type of medieval states should the domain of the Dukes of Burgundy be attributed to? The research of E.Lecuppre-Desjardin gains new dimensions when compared with Russian historiography which has its own tradition of study the history of la Grande Principaute de Bourgogne and a different terminological system, opening new connotations of the term 'state'. Most importantly, a detached approach to the medieval West in the context of the World history allows us to surmise a positive connection between the failure of the dukes of Burgundy in a state-building and a striking economic and cultural rise of that region. If Europe was an exception, then lands of the dukes of Burgundy of later Middle Ages were the essence of this exceptionality.

DT Article
DE strategy; deterrence; management strategy; the national human capital;
   interest; political goal
ID TECHNOLOGY; DETERRENCE
AB The article attempts to present a new vision for the strategic development of the Russian Federation. The authors note that the search for strategy should be made on the meta-level analysis in order to take into account either the military and political context of national security or the future interests of Russia. This allows one to reduce uncertainty in the strategic planning process.
   The author notes that the current military-political strategy of Russia is based on a fairly old idea of deterrence. This strategy is reactive in nature and involves responding to external challenges and threats in the international political environment. Meanwhile, the global political landscape is undergoing a significant transformation, in which a key aspect of national security will be a wide range of connectivity options to further political development of the state and society.
   Another disadvantage of deterrence strategy is that the threats are not differentiated from national interests and political goals. The author offers his version of the conceptualization of the terminology and the essential differences of different types of threats and assess the consequences of misunderstanding such differences.
   As for the strategy of deterrence, the authors suggest an alternative strategy of "control", which aims at the formation of a systemic perspective directions of development of the society. A key element of this strategy is the forging and maintenance of the national human capital, which provides connectivity, adaptability and innovationability of various branches of the governance and dealing with external challenges. "Control" means an intensification strategy of the state policy in the field of science, culture, the promotion of spiritual development and production of advanced innovation.

DE philosophy; true philosophy; modern philosophy; culture; philosophy of

AB Background: Discussions on the actual role and status of philosophy continuously arise, especially at the time of crises, abrupt changes to habitual ways of life and patterns of thought and behavior. Throughout the 20th century philosophical thought, both in the West and in Russia, has undergone a number of major reconsiderations, with controversial outcomes. Philosophy was, in fact, transformed into ideology, i.e. a system of beliefs that ultimately serves the interests of the ruling elite and has a definite apologetic aim - to justify the existing social arrangements and foster the required unanimity of opinions in the society. Liberal arts students and anyone pursuing philosophical studies are taught that the true philosophy is philosophy of science, while philosophy per se does not deserve serious attention because such philosophy is a relic of the past.
   Objective: The article aims to reveal the causes of the decline of philosophy, to reclaim the status and meaning of true philosophy, and to forecast its perspective development in the modern world. To meet these objectives the authors make use of the analytical, historical, cultural, comparative and hermeneutical methods of research.
   Results: The article gives substantial evidence to the fact that the inability of modern philosophy to address urgent political, social, etc. issues in Russia is the result of its deliberate three-stage transformation into ideology throughout the 20th century. It is demonstrated that the philosophy of culture is the modern way of philosophizing and the true philosophy of our time.
   The article highlights some unresolved issues connected with this approach: the essence of culture; the principles, laws and the purpose of cultural development; the correlation between culture and life.
   The article also argues that the ultimate goal of unraveling the meaning of modern philosophy is to go from the philosophy "about something" to the philosophy of the person generated by his/her independent thought. This kind of further development is only possible in the situation of academic freedom and the person's independence in finding and absorbing knowledge.
   Conclusion: The contribution of this study to the contemporary philosophical discourse is threefold: firstly, it demonstrates that the role and status of modern philosophy are different from and surpass those of narrower fields of knowledge; secondly, it defines modern philosophy as the philosophy of culture; thirdly, it envisions the future of modern philosophy as the philosophy generated by the person capable of independent thinking. This study can be applied to interpreting and evaluating current and past social issues from a cultural and philosophical standpoint.

DT Article
DE Knox; memoirs; 1917 Russian Revolution; political processes; Russian
   Army; Russian People
AB The author offers an interpretation of Alfred Knox's memoirs "With the Russian Army. The Diary of a Military Attache. 1914-1917" in order to reconstruct the political processes of the 1917 Russian Revolution as they were viewed by a western witness. The article considers Knox's interpretation of the Russian Revolution's pre-conditions, evolution and the causes of Bolshevik's seizing power. The author analyzes the way Knox characterizes the events, describes the actors of the Revolution and political culture of the Russian people.
   The author shows that the main topic of Knox's memoirs was the Russian army conditions which he considers in connection with the analysis of the military potential of Russia as an ally and the problem of inter-allied cooperation.
   The author discusses Knox's explanation and description of the Russian people's temper, his interpretation of the wide-spread Russian auto-stereotypes and his "colonial discourses".
   The article shows that in Knox's opinion Russian people's self-reflection demonstrated establishing of the political cult of people/"ordinary people" as a source of the highest legitimacy. This was one of the bases of Bolsheviks' legitimacy concept and their rights for power declared on behalf of "ordinary people".
   The author argues that Knox's evaluation of Russia as an ally was the main "prism of his perception" of the 1917 Russian Revolution events and Russian people's behavior at that time. The other factors which influenced Knox's explanations of particular revolutionary processes and Russian people's temper were values of the British conservative political culture and traditional stereotypes about Russia and Russians shared by Knox.

AB The present article undertakes a critical review of the new book of Jean Tirole, the winner of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Economics, "The theory of corporate finance", which has recently been published in Russian. The book makes a real contribution to the profession by summarizing the whole field of corporate finance and bringing together a big body of research developed over the last thirty years. By simplifying modeling, using unified analytical apparatus, undertaking reinterpretation of many previously received results, and structuring the material in original way Tirole achieves a necessary unity and simplicity in exposition of extremely heterogeneous theoretical and empirical material. The book integrates the new institutional economic theory into classical corporate finance theory and by doing so contributes to making a new type of textbook, which is quite on time and is likely to become essential reading for all graduate students in corporate finance and microeconomics and for everyone interested in these disciplines.

AB The author would like to stress that his notes do not claim to hold objective judgments or meet the criteria of scientific rigor. However, the reality reflected in the author's memories is not a phantom of his imagination but real events his life, which is closely linked with the history of the Voprosy Filosofii journal. Despite all the twists and turns of both the social life and the official ideology, the magazine managed not only to survive but to remain an organ with its own position, always responding to the most acute problems of the day and putting forward most crucial questions. The author is convinced that this is so because the journal has never followed the political conjuncture but oriented on the opinion of leading scientists and cultural figures, publishing articles by them or analyzing their legacy. The journal's editors always held the opinion that philosophy can develop fruitfully only if it closely cooperates with science and culture that's why the journal often published "exclusive" items by leading scientists, literary artists, film directors and theater producers. The author of the article is happy that he has also made his fair share of contribution into this.

AB The fate of a Serbian political emigrant in Russia, the journalist, politician, and historian Dugan IvanoviC Semiz (1884-1955) and his family, is studied for the first time on the basis of archival materials from St. Petersburg: the Institute of Russian Literature of the Russian Academy of Sciences (Pushkin House) and the Central State Historical Archive (St. Petersburg) and Archive of Russian Academy of Sciences (Moscow). Dugan Semiz was a journalist and press correspondent at the frontlines of WWI and the author of historical and political pamphlets and books, and translations of Serbian epics into Russian. He was first arrested in Leningrad in 1929 for being a former active participant in the Serbian nationalist revolutionary organisation Crna ruka (The Black Hand) and sentenced to five years in the GULAG. His first spell in the labor camps was followed by several others. Semiz did hard labor as a lumberjack in the Archangel region and at the construction of the White Sea Baltic Canal; he was exiled to Kazakhstan in Berlik, where Alexander Solzhenitsyn was also later exiled. Semiz was not released from the GULAG until 1953, not long before his death. Here I present some fragments of the works by Semiz on historical and current relationships between Serbia and Russia, the causes of WWII, as well as his letters from the GULAG and exile to his family and letters from his family to him. These documents show hist strong personality, which was maintained even through his period in the GULAG. The archive materials presented in the paper are another historical document of Stalinist terror and are of interest for the study of Serbo-Russian historical and cultural links in the mid 20th century.

   narcissism
ID ARCHITECTONICS
AB The present article examines the two opposing approaches to revolution, that of cult-like worship vs. that of amnesia, or the nation's foundation myth vs. the origin of trauma. The author provides an analysis of the contradictory attitude toward the October Revolution in today's Russia, both when considered as an event in 1917 or seen as a political fact of universal significance. The recent history and political overturns which occurred in geographical proximity of Russia give multiple examples of how the idea of revolution as the highest possible threat is formed. This perspective allows to view Modernity as a revolution in itself and also as the Age of revolutions, fundamental to which is the conflict between the idea of the new and that of order, as well as dualism between modernization and totalitarianism, freedom and technocratic dictatorship. Particular attention is given to the destiny of both the notion and the phenomenon of revolution in postmodern thinking, considering its perception of history as a 'vanishing denotatum'. Revolution can also serve as one of the key notions of chronopolitics, or the politics of speed. Apart from this, the author attempts to demonstrate the historical nature of such terms as 'the present age', 'the time being', and similar: they emerge only when unified time, owing to ever increasing speed, gets exfoliated engendering the conflict between the alternating phases of lagging and outstripping. From the anthropological point of view, revolution can be analysed in terms of pathopsychology of political narcissism.

SO PRAVO-ZHURNAL VYSSHEI SHKOLY EKONOMIKI
LA Russian
DT Article
DE state power; local government; public interest; autonomy of local
   self-government bodies; municipal formation; public interest
AB The paper features the question of possible correlation of the notions of "state interest" and "public interest" as a common and comprehensive on the basis of the comparative legal method, as well as the methods of synthesis and induction. In turn, state interest is postulated as an integral part of a wider interest. The analysis of the current Russian practice of economic relations between the state and local authorities shows how the state compulsorily turns part of the public (in a broad sense) interest in the principle of targeted use of municipal property, including the availability of an exhaustive on-site inventory of property intended to address issues of local importance. However, as soon as this public interest changed - namely, the state agreed with the possibility of redistribution of powers between the municipal and regional (sub-entities of the Russian Federation) levels of public authority, which, of course, often involves the redistribution of the object-matter composition of municipal property related to it: the corresponding lists of property, that were rigidly assigned to municipalities, were excluded from federal legislation. The mechanisms of mutual relations of the state and local authorities seems to be convincing evidence that the public interests of the state and local self-government are united, in fact, local self-government bodies today are the lowest level of a unified system of state (or, with the consideration of the need for their formal separation, - public) power with common functions and tasks being solved both at the top (federal and regional) and at lower (municipal-territorial or municipal-settlement) levels. Moreover, despite the formal separation, the levels of local government and state power in terms of the forms and methods of exercising public power do not differ at all. The considered practice, on the whole, leads to the conclusion that as soon as a public interest is objected to by law (and the only subject of legal research is this is an objectified interest in law, in other cases it is an object for studying other sciences: sociology, political science, and so on.) - it becomes common to the entire system of public authority and it is necessary to find a balance of state-legal and municipal-legal interests on the basis of internal noncontradiction (combination).

AB The aim of this article is to inform researchers of documents of A. F. Kerensky kept in the foreign archives. Life of A. F. Kerensky, his role in the history of the Russian revolutions, and his place in the post-revolutionary emigration can be traced in various sources, not just written accounts, but also audio and photo documents. These sources include official documents, police dossier files, personal documents, records of conversations and interviews, articles in periodicals, published books, posters, photographs, visual materials. The sources can be arranged chronologically into three groups: those from the period before 1917; those relating to the events of 1917; those from the emigration period. Documents that can be of interest for researchers, are kept in numerous collections containing information about the pre-revolutionary period, the events of crucial 1917, and the post-revolutionary emigration; there are personal provenance fonds of Kerensky himself, and those of famous Russian emigrants, political and public figures, writers, and also collections of famous foreign political and public figures, historians, journalists. More often then not, the documents are dispersed in different archives. Memoirs represent a substantial part of sources containing information about A. F. Kerensky. Memoirs vary in size and information content, but are often the only source of information about events and persons, and on the whole they descript facts differently from official documents and include details that can be found in no other type of documents. Private letters form a significant part of Kerensky's archival heritage. The importance of correspondence for reconstruction of historical realities can hardly be overestimated. The article informs of archival documents from foreign archives and libraries, that disclose life and activities of A. F. Kerensky on the eve of the Revolution of 1917, during the Revolution of 1917 and in emigration. A. F. Kerensky maintained active correspondence with politicians, public persons, writers, historians. His letters are stored in the Bakhmeteff archive in personal provenance fonds of V. M. Zenzinov, writer and one of the socialist revolutionaries party leaders, of diplomat E. V. Sablin, of Russian and American historian and essay writer M. M. Karpovich, of political and public person A. V. Baikalov; in the Goover archive in the fond of V. M. Maklakov, envoy of the Provisionary Government in France in 1917-1924; in the New York Public Library in the collection of writer Vladimir Nabokov, that of Alfred Anthony Williams, theologian, writer, educator, one of the Baptist movement leaders, and that of Ralf Thompson, American writer, teacher and editor, who worked in New York Times, Time Magazine, etc.

AB The article is the first study in Russia's regional historiography to look into the history of library services rendered to the population of Bashkiria (the Republic of Bashkortostan) in the 20th century, drawing on archival documents and largely unknown periodical materials. As this important topic requires more solid research to be done, this study largely focuses on major developments of library business in the socio-political history of Russia. As a result of targeted policies of the Soviet state and drastic expansion of library network in the 20th century, libraries, being a source of knowledge and information, turned into a propaganda tool. From being a pastime and part of everyday activity the attending of libraries and reading of library books became a form of communist education of the population. The Soviet state's library policies excelled in creating a diversified network of libraries and library services for the population. Now in the Republic of Bashkortostan there are both socially-oriented universal libraries (libraries for children, youth, the blind, university/academic ones, etc.) and specialized libraries (medical, agricultural, technical, art ones, etc.). The author concludes that in spite of the population's intensive use of the Internet libraries should not lose their position as a source of knowledge and authentic information in any area.

DT Article
DE region; scientific community; reform; risks; adaptation; prospects
AB The article analyzes the problems of adaptation of the regional scientific community related to reforming the Russian Academy of Sciences. Based on the analysis of the materials of in-depth interviews with managers and researchers in regional academic institutes in the Udmurt Republic the main risks of reform for the regional academic community are determined, and the possibilities for its further development are assessed. As the main factors influencing the transformation of the academic community, the author points out the gradual transition to the project approach in scientific work, the new system for assessing results, an uncertainty of the subject of the request for scientific research. The need to adapt to new conditions creates a high degree of tension, especially in connection with the ongoing structural changes - the merge of branch institutes into the regional scientific center. Many managers assess this merger and its consequences optimistically, but the article also contains the opinions of scientific workers about possible negative consequences. The author identifies the following risks for the scientific regional community: the risk of reducing interregional and international scientific ties, the risk of reducing the scientific subject to issues of regional and applied importance, the risk of increasing dependence on the political and economic characteristics of the region. The main opportunities are associated with the development of intersectoral and interdisciplinary ties, the growth of symbolic capitalization within the region, the strengthening of unique scientific directions and resources. The conditions were formulated for implementing the identified opportunities through region policy instruments.

DE India; reform; "centre-state relations"; Planning.ommission; local

AB Up to the beginning of 1990s, the development model of India has exhausted its potential for further growth. This sense of exhaustion strengthened the ruling elites' consciousness to the need of a "paradigm shift". In the history of Indian statehood one can distinguish a few attempts of socio-economic reforms. Nonetheless, all these projects were postponed for domestic political reasons. The investigation of social processes in India's economic and political spheres should be dealt with on a complementarity basis. Since the beginning of 1980s, the centralized administration was not delivering economic goods. Federal institutional framework that emerged after the independence should have been modified in accordance with new realities. The 1991 economic reform has increased a resilience of a political system. Over the last 25 years, India has become one of the leading players in a world arena, demonstrating impressive economic growth. At the same time, the country is still suffering from poverty and regional disparities. As emphasized in official government statements, the aim of reforms was not only in reviving Indian economy, but also in "combining sustainable economic growth with equity and social justice". To implement social obligations, it is needful to ensure larger scale cooperation between states as well as between the latter and the federal centre, to reactivate the development potential of local self-government institutions. To promote a cooperative federalism in the beginning of 2015, the Government of India has taken a decision to establish a new institution named NITI (National Institution for Transforming India) Aayog in place of the Planning Commission. New global trends and internal needs set a task of improving the viability of the development strategy. This may involve new reforms. The article examines the changes in socio-political development of the country after economic reforms and analyzes challenges for further progress.

SO VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA ISTORIYA-TOMSK STATE
   UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HISTORY
LA Russian
DT Article
DE SiptahMerenptah; Amenmessu; Sethos II; XIX dynasty
AB The article is devoted to the question of parentage of the last male Pharaoh of XIX dynasty Siptah and his relationship to the Ramesside dynasty. The author examines three of his predecessors - Merenptah, Sethos II and Amenmessu, each of whom is usually regarded in historiography as Siptah's father. According to the author, there are no facts proving that Sethos II was the father of Siptah. On the contrary, the text on the ostracon CGC 25515 from workmen' village in Deir el-Medina, which mention about construction of Sethos II' royal tomb in Valley of the Kings and his death in his 6th regnal year, designates his successor on the throne Siptah not as the king's son but by very strange epithet "other". The author thinks that this fact can point out the absence of direct parentage between Sethos II and Siptah. Besides the author came to conclusion that Amenmessu could not be the father of Siptah because of the lack of any evidence too. The one argument that is usually used to prove their direct parentage, is the naos from British museum that is lost now. However, his reproduction contains the inscription which mention the Horus name of Siptah as
   [GRAPHICS]
   .
   It is usually translated as "appearing in (the city) Khemmis". As it is widely accepted, this epithet can supposedly prove the direct parentage between Siptah and Amenmessu because the last bore the epithet "one whom (the goddesses) Isis nursed in (the city) Khemmis". The mention of one and the same place-name in epithets of both the Pharaohs can supposedly point out the direct parentage between the above-mentioned kings. But the author shows that Horus name
   [GRAPHICS]
   could not be translated as "appearing in (the city) Khemmis", but only as "appearing as the king of Lower Egypt". That is why the epithet of Siptah has nothing to do this the one of Amenmessu, and there are no other arguments to prove their direct parentage. In author's opinion, only Merenptah could pretend to this role. This opinion can be proved by the fact of changing Siptah's throne name from "Ramses-Siptah" on "Merenptah-Siptah" at the beginning of his reign. As it is suggested by many scholars, the mother of Siptah was the Asiatic concubine, and he had no legal rights to ascend the throne. The Great Chancellor Bay, one of the main political figures of end of the XIX Dynasty, mentioned that the accession of Siptah was accompanied by some struggles, and Bay must establish the young king on the throne of his father. One can suggest that Siptah could change his name to prove his legitimacy by reference of the origin from Merenptah.

AB The phenomenon of the revival of the solidarity economy is the subject of public and political discourse. Emerging in the last decades, associations and cooperatives began to make their presence felt again in the economy and in politics. The value of solidarity economy, not only in the diversification of economic instruments. Its principles can bring significant benefits, because it brings together a balanced economic sphere with the humanistic values - serves as the basis and not as a means to people. There is an ontological relationship between the modern phenomenon of the revival of this method of economic activities and ideas of solidarity theorists of the last century. This article describes the appearance of a solidarity economy movement in different national and continental contexts, stressing the diversity of practices within civil society at local and international level. From the 90's, these movements have started organizing collaborative networks among themselves in the fields of the culture, the politics and the economy The author examines the prospects for cooperation between the movement for food sovereignty and solidarity economy, the forms taken by this multidimensional process. The collaborative and solidarity networks started to act in synergy in global actions. The author concludes that these networks in the specific field of the solidarity economy, have been multiplied in the entire world, assuring conditions of worthy work and consumption for millions of people.

AB The article presents a source-study of the historical memoirs of the research representatives of the white emigration, devoted to the assessment of events in the Urals in the years of revolution and civil war; comparative analysis of research objects and facts contained in the work from the standpoint of axiological approach.
   The set of sources, subjected to analysis, includes both memoir-genre documents of the leaders of the white movement and the multi-volume collections published abroad and dedicated to the history of revolutionary movement and events of the civil war.
   The great number of publications on the history of the revolutionary events in the Urals reflects the core nature of the period of strengthening the power of the Bolsheviks in the history of Soviet Russia. The research approaches prevailing in Soviet historiography, proceeded from the need of legitimation of the Bolsheviks' power, which influenced the choice of topics for historical research and the involvement of relevant source base. The change of the vector of historical research of the revolutionary military crisis that demanded expansion of the number and types of sources, reflecting the views and positions of the representatives of the warring parties. In this regard, the the factual content of historical memoirs of white emigrant participants of the revolutionary events, is invaluable.
   Documentary evidence contained in the works of the representatives of the white emigration, significantly broaden our understanding of the working methods of the Bolsheviks to strengthen their political influence, the development of Cossack movement in the Urals. The work, devoted to the causes and content of mass antiBolshevik speeches by the Ural workers, deserves special attention.
   Historical sketches and memoirs of the representatives of the white emigration are extremely diverse in terms of content and level of historical generalizations. However, the information contained in these documents allows us to give a more objective assessment of the events of socio-political transformation of the Russian society in the framework of a revolutionary transition.

   preventing policy
AB The article brings up to date the issue of corruption in the system of public management in European states. A set of measures to improve anti-corruption activities at the current stage of development of the world community is provided on the basis of the efficiency analysis regarding the current corruption preventive policy.
   The issue of corruption is among the global challenges of the day, addressing which will affect the way of development of the world community in the new century. One can see socially destructive consequences of corruption in all aspects of public life. Today, the issues of corruption are of special concern in respect of public authorities.
   The issue of corruption with multiple forms, such as lobbying, bribery, veiled thefts and abuses, is a social disease that is being globally integrated into the world community. However, the issue is of equal concern for developed countries as well as for the countries with the lower levels of economic development.
   "Transparency International" International non-governmental organization publishes annual ratings of countries regarding the level of perception of corruption. In 2016, for example, the average figure for 176 countries of the world was 43 points out of 100. In 2016, Denmark and New Zealand recorded the lowest level of corruption. These countries scored 90 points. Finland, Sweden and Switzerland were also found in the first five. The highest level of corruption was recorded in Somalia, South Sudan, North Korea, Syria and Yemen, - these countries scored less than 20 points.
   The rating illustrates interdependence between corruption and inequality in the distribution of power and national income in society.
   Corruption is a system of social relations that destruct society. However, there is no consensus on the reasons for corruption. To some extent, it is related to the intersectoral nature of the phenomenon, which is being studied by scientists from different branches of science at the same time (lawyers, managers, economists, sociologists, political scientists, etc.). The "multidimensional picture" of the causes of corruption, received as the result of the analysis will provide an opportunity to significantly modernize the anti-corruption policy.
   The analysis of public management, using the "principal-agency relationships" model shows explicitly that the main reason for the phenomenon of corruption in public administration is a conflict of interests between the managed society and its public officers. This conflict of interests can be balanced through moral education of public servants, nurturing moral principles and values of the professional culture of officials in the new trends of public administration development.
   The problem of an integrated approach to the analysis of this social phenomenon appears to be the only option for a truly effective policy for preventing corruption at all levels of public service.

AB The article describes the magazine-textbooks (1930-1932) meant for primary and secondary schools, which was the last innovation in publication of educational literature before the introduction of so-called stable textbooks in the whole Soviet Union. The article analyses the content and role of magazine-textbooks in education. They were meant to provide schools with up-to-date information on the achievements of the last five-year plan period, the campaigns against religion and alcohol, industrialisation and collectivisation. The content of magazine-textbooks as study aids at schools shifted radically from educational to informative and propagandist-their purpose was not so much to promote general education but political education of school students in the whole Soviet Union. The fact that the publication of magazine-textbooks became the greatest project in children's and youth journalism in the Soviet period is not of small significance. The people engaged in their publication included renowned experts from the People's Commissariat of Education, authoritative educationists and the best children's writers (A. Vvedensky, D. Harms, M. Ilyin, S. Marshak, Y. Shvarts, et al) who were editorial staff members of the well-known children's magazines Tshizh and Yozh.

AB This article analyzes a systematic approach to the study and publication of documents that can serve as a means of resolving issues of historical source study, historiography and archeography. "'The Short Course on the History of the VKP(b)': The Text and its History", a collection of documents published in 2014 by M. V. Zelenov and D. Brandenberger, is dedicated to the history of the text of the "Short Course on the History of the VKP(b)." (work on this textbook stretched from 1931 to 1956). In the preface, the authors offer a new, systematic approach to the classification of historical sources that forms the structure of the book and provides a basis for the archeographic principles governing the publication of party documents. Grouping together all known documents according to subject and addressee demonstrates that the initiators and authors of the "Short Course" were party executives within the Central Committee apparatus. Grouping together documents according to Central Committee activity formed the basis for the structure of the book (work on variants of the book, distribution of the book abroad, reception of the book, attempts to update the book in 1946-1956). Grouping the documents according to function established the value of each document in terms of source study. Use of the method of diplomatics (formulaic analysis) allowed for the development of archeographic techniques for the publication of resolutions emanating from various Central Committee organs. The editors of this edition consider the "Short Course" to be a form of social consciousness: it was a "fact" governing party education (and they publish documents to this effect in the book); it was a "fact" governing to political struggle (and they publish I.V. Stalin's instructions in this regard; it was a "fact" governing ideology (and they publish ideological resolutions and instructions to this effect from the Central Committee and Stalin himself); and it was a "fact" in the study of history (and they analyze the various approaches to history that I.V. Stalin, Ye. Iaroslavskii and P.N. Pospelov took toward historical evidence and theory. The systematic approach to the publication of documents structuring this collection represents an innovation in the resolution of issues concerning historical source study, historiography and archeography and could be successfully used in other areas of the field of historical sciences.

AB Drawing on numerous archival sources the article analyses activity of the Kazan Judicial Chamber and the judiciary in the Kazan gubernia in the days of revolutionary events of 1917-1918. The article draws on both unpublished and published sources, and also on the print media of the period. To eliminate the defects of tsarist judiciary after the February Revolution of 1917 the Russian Provisional Government formed a committee for restoration of the basic principles of the Regulations of 1864 under the Ministry of Justice. The committee also reviewed issues related to the activities of the Judiciary Chambers. Overall, the February events brought no significant changes in structure, composition and directions of activities (except in dealing with political cases) of the judicial institutions in Russia, including Kazan gubernia. Judicial and prosecutorial officials of Kazan and those of the Kazan Judicial Chamber and District Court swore a loyalty oath to the Provisional Government. Administration of justice continued as before. On the account of the First World War, the heads of the Kazan Judicial Chamber had to deal with issues not related to administration of justice, such as conscription or appraisement of material situation of the judicature. Profound changes occurred only after the October Revolution of 1917. Immediately after coming to power, the Bolsheviks appealed to the judicature of Kazan to use their legal experience under new conditions, that is, in their desired drift. This, however, proved counterproductive. Members of the Kazan Judicial Chamber, as well as the majority of judicial and prosecutorial officials of the Kazan gubernia refused to serve the new regime. Moreover, employees of the Kazan Judicial Chamber and District Court actively boycotted the Soviet government resolutions and decisions on establishment of a new judicial system. In the end, the Kazan Judicial Chamber was abolished by the Bolsheviks, the building sealed off by armed soldiers. Capture of Kazan by the divisions of the Czechoslovak Corps resulted in a temporary return of judicial and prosecutorial officials to their office. After the restoration of Soviet power, there was no question of restoration of the Kazan Judicial Chamber.

AB The article explores the reasons behind the ebbs and flows in the Soviet ethnic policy. Building on the geopolitical theory of R. Collins, the authors hypothesize that the ethnic policy of the USSR was closely connected with its foreign policy. The authors study the dynamics of the Soviet ethnic policy and compare it with the dynamics of geopolitical tensions to conclude that the changes in priorities that defined the principles of interethnic relations in the USSR at least in part depended on the level of geopolitical tensions in the international arena. At the times when "peaceful coexistence" prevailed in foreign policy, the Soviet leadership pursued the policy of "indigenization", encouraged the development of ethnic minorities, nurtured their cultures and identity. The escalation of the international conflict bred the need for national unity, which spurred shifts towards the policy of Russification.

AB The article attempts to explain V.Putin's continuously high approval rating under the conditions of economic recession. On the basis of the existing studies of factors of political support, S.Shevchuk elaborates a number of hypotheses that explain this phenomenon and provides empirical tests. His research shows that the contradiction between the poor economic conditions and high level of political support for the Russian president can be largely explained by the "rally 'round the flag" effect. A number of important domestic and foreign political events contributed to the rise of patriotic sentiments, not least due to the appropriate coverage by the media. Just when the effect from one event was about to disappear, the effect from the subsequent event stepped in. According to the author, this is the trick that explains the "Teflon" rating of Putin, which remains consistently high despite the mounting socio-economic problems.

DT Article
DE corruption; political corruption; constitutional legislation;
   anti-corruption reform; modern constitutionalism; science of
   constitutional law
AB The article highlights the main areas of impact of anti-corruption institutions and phenomena on the Russian constitutional law. First, the modern constitutional law is affected by the global political theory. Over the past decades, it has gained a strong academic potential to understand the processes of corruption. Nowadays, its negligence harms the constitutional legal science. The next important area of influence of the anti-corruption agenda on constitutional law and relevant legislation associates with the adoption of universal and regional anti-corruption conventions. Through their controlling mechanisms, they have gradually transformed domestic legislation. Furthermore, among European institutions we must mention the European Court of Human Rights and the Venice Commission which are beginning to use the terminology and characteristics of the theory of political corruption. However, special attention is paid to the cases when anti-corruption standards go through constitutional law from the Russian administrative reform. For the traditional and rather conservative domestic legal theory, this influence could be the most evident and convincing one. The examples of such influence are the institutions related to conflict of interest, declaration of assets, ensuring transparency of authorities and others. And the most important that, transforming to the constitutional legal norms and institutions, they begin to prevent political corruption, which is one of the key problems of the Russian Federation constitutional order.

AB Political Science, as a rule, considers revolution in isolation, or abstraction, from moral qualities of those people who make it. Moreover, even when political scientists view revolution through the lenses of moral categories, i.e., whether "revolution is good or bad", whether it "brings maximum benefit to a maximum number of people" etc., moral of revolutionaries per se, or their personal, everyday moral, their moral as people, is still overlooked. A.Shvyrkov believes it is high time this topic should be addressed and outlines a number of possible approaches to its development.

AB Russia puts ahead ambitious but achievable goals of long-term economic development - ensuring the high level of population welfare, strengthening the geopolitical role of the country as one of the global leaders defining the world political agenda. The only possible path to meeting these goals is the transition of the economy to the innovative society-oriented model of development. This problem setting means, in its own turn, the necessity to form the national technological initiative based upon the national technological foundation. About this situation, the government sets a global goal, the development of national technological base capable of development and production of competitive science-intensive products on the world market to solve priority tasks in the field of socio-economic development and national security of Russia.

   political repressions; Trubetskoy Bastion prison; Civil War
AB In the article, on the basis of documentary archival materials, the fate of the Russian generals who were imprisoned in the Peter and Paul Fortress (in St. Petersburg) in 1917 is studied. During the revolutionary events (in the spring, after the February Revolution, and in the autumn, after the October Revolution) many people, including the military, were imprisoned. The prison of the Trubetskoy bastion in the Peter and Paul Fortress was one of the main political prisons, therefore some generals were sent there. In March, former military ministers, the district commander, as well as those who were associated with the imperial family were imprisoned. In Summer, one of the participants in the speech of L.G. Kornilov, as well as some monarchists were also imprisoned. The third wave took place in the autumn, when the military ministers of the Provisional Government, the command of the Northern Front and other generals opposed to the Soviet power were detained. In total, in 1917, 15 or 16 generals were in prison fortresses, and they were people of different convictions. Some of them during the civil war found themselves on the side of the Reds, some on the White side, some of them emigrated. Therefore, let us state that the imprisonment in the fortress did not affect their further choice. The study of the documentary materials of the commandant's office of the Peter and Paul Fortress made it possible to identify the names of those who were imprisoned in it, as well as to find out some details of their conclusion.

TI STAFF TRAINING FOR MILITARY AND CIVIL SERVICE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 19TH
   CENTURY: ACADEMIC YEARS OF HISTORIAN, GENERAL-LIEUTENANT N.K. SCHILDER
SO RUDN JOURNAL OF RUSSIAN HISTORY
LA Russian
DT Article
DE N.K. Schil'der; K.A. Schil'der; Emperors Nicholas I; Alexander I; The
   Pages corpus; The Military Engineering Academy of Nicholas; the
   secondary and higher school
AB The purpose of the article is to replenish the information field of Russian historians by introducing data about a little-known element in the historiography in the system of staff training in elite educational institutions of Russia in the middle of the 19th century. The object of the study is the young age of Nikolai Karlovich Schilder (1842-1902), who by honourable service in the military field rose to the rank of Lieutenant General (1893) after completing two educational institutions. As a result of his historical studies, he became the corresponding member of the Petersburg Academy of Sciences (1900).
   Based on the information found in archival and published historical sources, as well as in the annexes to the published historical works, there is considered the process of N.K. Schilder's acquiring not only a large body of knowledge, but also the process of his personality formation as a patriot of Russia.
   Five years (1857-1862) were a special period of his life as a future military engineer and historian - the time when he obtained secondary and special higher military education. The years of studies in the Pages Corps and the Nikolaev Engineering Academy were of great use for him. He showed good results in studies and extraordinary creative abilities. The article shows the scope of knowledge and quality of skills obtained by N.K. Shilder while studying, the degree of his preparedness to work both as a military engineer and historian-researcher. The article proves that he obtained professional knowledge necessary for a military engineer; he was accustomed to thinking big, to working systematically, independently and creatively. Self-discipline and acquired skills of research work were the key to his future success in the field of military and military-political history and in the biographical genre.

TI THEORETICAL ASPECTS OF POLITICAL ELITE IN SMALL STATES
SO MGIMO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE small state; political elite; elite theory; international relations;
   security
AB The article provides a theoretical analysis of political elites in small states. The author uses comparative analysis and descriptive approach to demonstrate main challenges that small countries ruling class is facing.
   The article states that regardless of widespread use of small state concept in political science and international relations theory its definition is still essentially contested. The author elaborates on the quantitative and qualitative approached to the given notion. The conclusion is that small states are not a "small copy" of great powers, and their foreign policy actions are driven by a specific and unique logic. The main feature of this logic is dependency, and asymmetrical relationship with major powers. This shapes the specifics of small state elites' political preferences and interests.
   The article highlights the relevancy of theoretical scrutiny of activity and behavior of political elites of small states. Presented analysis of various cases of political elites' actions and strategies can to contribute to elite theory. Mainly, contribution is possible in the study of interconnection between internal and external (international) political factors that are influencing actions of elite. This area of research is especially relevant at the current stage of elite theory development. Globally, increase in number of small states, expansion of their toolkit of influence in international system, and erosion of boundary between domestic and foreign policy of states can be considered as a burning issue in Political Science. Also "factor of size" in the field of elite studies in different individual states and interstate associations can further contribute to the discussion.

AB Since 1990s, the number of states conflicts decreased and they started saying that the classical wars disappeared but at the same time, the number of internal conflicts increased dramatically. The end of colonial regime in Africa didn't bring peace to the region - the new wave of internal conflicts and civil wars overwhelmed the region. In the given article the authors analyze political and complicated socio-economic situation in the Tropical Africa, describe the conflicts in this zone, their typology, results and factors. The authors attempt to analyze internal and external causes of conflicts in the studied region, taking into account all elements of each conflict and their interdependence. The subject of the article is the conflict as the social element presenting the important part of international reality. It is noted that the crisis in the region influences every part of economic, social, and political spheres, so the solution is not possible without structural changes. In this connection, conflicts are the logical results of regional crisis as well as uncertain activity of international society. This situation provokes the large wave of migrants from the region and inside it. The countries the Tropical Africa can't guarantee any suitable level of life for the citizens, and the situation can't be resolved without active role of international community.

AB Any new information about life and activities of well-known scientist M. I. Rostovtsev is important and acquires significant scientific interest. We have recently discovered one of Petrograd newspapers with M. I. Rostovtsev's article, which has been completely forgotten now. The article titled "New Political Order and Science" was published in August 1917 in the newspaper of the Cadet Party "Svobodny Narod".
   The key idea of the paper was his conviction that hard power could only be the guarantor of preservation and development of culture and science in Russia. In his opinion, weakening of the state because of revolutionary perturbations was the major danger of scientific life of the country.
   This publication of the paper of the great scientist is of significant interest nowadays in the difficult situation of reforms in science in Russia. It is especially meaningful in the context of the 1917 revolution centenary.

   battle on the Lipitsa; the battle on the Neva; biography of Aleksandr
   Nevskii; Medieval Rus'
AB The article provides insight into debates about the life and political activities of Aleksandr Nevskii and the historical memory of him which have been going on for the last year or two. The author focuses on arguments used by the scholars in this polemics and analyzes the attempts to cast doubt on the results of research which has already been conducted. The author recognizes the necessity to take into consideration the opinions of these scholars who have suggested new interpretations of the sources on the basis of scientifically tested methodology, hence drawing conclusions about the discreditable facts in the biography of the prince and the inefficiency of his policy in general (G. Fennell, D. N. Danilevskii). However, particular emphasis is placed on the insufficient account of the existing historiographic work as well as the methodically inappropriate use (and sometimes disregard) of the above-mentioned sources. This drawback is typical of the works of the authors whose insight into the issues they study is not deep enough and who, nonetheless, are given an opportunity to express their views in leading historical periodicals. These aspects allow us to determine the development of a tendency to neglect the works of our historical forbearers - Soviet and Russian historians. As an example, the article provides the analysis of the theoretical construct A. N. Nesterenko's article, published in "Voprosy Istorii" (No 1, 2016) and containing a number of hypotheses that remain unconfirmed by the facts to a considerable extent. The refutation of these hypotheses does not take a great deal of effort, but makes us refer once again to the analysis of the sources and to the quite voluminous literature on this subject. That is why the article provides a representative survey of the statements of the scholars who at different times touched upon some disputable issues in the frame of the topic "Aleksandr Nevskii", namely: the relations of Iaroslav Vsevolodovich with his spouse Feodosiia and father-in-law Mstislav Udaloi (the Bold), the spread of the practice of placing the minor children of the Rurik house at the prince's table, the battle on the Neva, the circumstances of the canonization of Aleksandr, the interpretation of the chronicles and hagiographical texts, the reports of Tatishchev, and the like.

AB The author of the article analyzes the most famous Canadian theories of origin and evolution of the Canadian political culture (CPC) during the first half of the 20th century. He marks the weak and strong points of these theories, their contradictions and evaluates these theories.
   The article also deals with the economic theory of the staples goods of Harold Innis, the theory of the Canadian regional political cultures of G. Horowitz, the theory of wave immigration of Nelson Wiseman.
   The general defect of these theories consists in the fact that their authors take into account one and only factor as the basic one for constructing the functional and structural scheme of the ideological and the political development in Canada.
   Besides, the last two theories about the Canadian political culture are based on the historical context and at the same time their construction's base is represented by the ideological concepts of the American scientists "fragments" by Lous Hartz and "forming events" by Seymour Martin Lipset in the communities of the New World.
   According to the author, the adoption of these concepts does not only reflect the past historical events but also the current processes in Canada's political culture.
   The author concludes that the Canadian political culture is the unique historical phenomenon only for Canada and he also says about that the functional-structural schemes are developed within the individual scientific disciplines. The interdisciplinary approach is necessary for studies of the Canadian political culture, and the development of the original theory is based on the use of the numerous factors of the historical-cultural development of the Canadian society.

AB The main idea of the article is to present a new experience for curriculum design in the higher education sector - political linguistics. The study of political discourse is a pragmatically orientated trend. The urgency of curriculum program is determined by the importance of political communication for modern society as a socially structuring, purposeful and typified activity. The scope of political linguistics taught within the Ural linguistic school includes studying national systems of political metaphors, processes and types of intertextuality, discourse strategies, political concepts, and genres viewed as subjects of cognitive science, which borders with discourse analysis. We suggest that they are the central mechanisms of political discourse formation, since they provide professional knowledge development. Studying political linguistics is essential for students as it helps them to better understand, analyze and produce political texts (e.g. when translating texts from one language into another). Further, it teaches them how to sense political processes in their country as well as how to decode hidden meanings and means of manipulating public conscience and opinion.

DE Nikanor (Brovkovich); Konstantin Leontiev; culture-criticism; modernity;
   compensation; avant-garde; traditionalism
AB Archbishop Nikanor (Brovkovich) (1826-1890), and Konstantin Nikolaevich Leontiev (1831-1891), whose ideas are often considered as identical, are representatives of the Russian conservatism of the second half of the XIX century. Their views can be attributed to the culture-critical direction of the traditionalist type which interprets modernization as a threat to the existence of both the natural habitat of man and man himself. These thinkers oppose progress, as they believe that modernization is homogenizing culture and destroying traditions. To identify the differences between the views of Archbishop Nicanor and Leontiev, it seems necessary to turn to the theory of "compensation" by I. Ritter, G. Lubbe, and O. Marquard. According to this theory, modernity produces ways of compensation of its own rational homogeneity. Among these ways of compensation, we can find the interest of irrational and unique phenomena, and of individual "stories of origin". Thus, culture-criticism itself is revealed as a way of a compensation of the standardizing aspects of modernization. Thus, Leont'ev contrasts modernity with "Byzantium" as a traditional culture, while Archbishop Nikanor does so with the ideal of individual Orthodox holiness. This demonstrates the difference between them, despite the fact that their traditionalism turns out to be equally modern, performing the compensation. However, Leontiev was sketching out the ways of destroying modernity, linking it with the victory of socialism which he predicted within the political avant-garde, leading to a new feudalism. In contrast, Archbishop Nikanor considered progress as inevitable, offering to compensate for its negative consequences by maintaining the irrational and unique aspects of traditional religiosity.

DE ethnic territorial autonomy; ethnic group; authority; interaction;

ID POLITICS
AB Social sciences take in the importance of the mode of interactions between actors who are involved in interethnic relations. This mode is critical for achieving a balance between actors' public positions and preferences. The majority of academic researches devoted to the phenomenon of ethnic territorial autonomy (ETA) focus on the arrangements between state and ethnic minorities, firstly, and different tiers of authorities, secondly. Studies of interethnic relations either actualize the problem of ethnic conflicts resolving, or concern an effective participation of ethnic minorities in cultural, social and economic life, and in public affairs. Thus, ETA is regarded both as an instrument and as an arena for parties to dispute. Another perception of an ethnic territorial autonomy is a tier of authority without special distinguishing features. In this article, the author proposes a new approach for consideration, which allows to gain a better understanding of the way an ethnic territorial autonomy balances preferences and expectations as well as positions of actors relevant to it. ETA is an entity with relatively high level of self-governance. The character of its cooperations with other parties concerned and political key players is important to a balance. An ethnic territorial autonomy interworks with both external actors (such as national state, international community, and kin-state) and internal actors, most notably other ethnic minorities that live in the autonomy. The proposed approach allows contemplating an autonomy as a key actor of comprehensive system of external and internal interactions. The author frames the taxonomy of effective and non-effective practices that secure an interethnic balance and functional systems of these two types of contacts around ETA. The character of an territorial autonomy authorities' participation in these interactions, the possibility to de-politicize the ethnicity within them, their consistency, the weight of some of their mechanisms

AB Based on the materials of more than 20 periodicals the paper shows the ways rhetoric and conception of enemy atrocities that rested on notions of explicitly inhumane enemy captivity was being formed and employed in Russia of 1917-1917. The author cataloguizes captivity images concentrated on pages of the central, regional and local Russian press and demonstrates stages of their development. It is concluded that such activities were determined not only by the task of consolidating belligerent society in the face of the enemy. Constant appeals to the "horrors" of enemy captivity were of much more importance as an indicator of extremely pragmatic attitude of Russia's military and political elite towards the problem of "victims of the war".

DT Article
DE Hungary; Slovakia; Right-wing radicalism; extremism; xenophobia;
   comparative analysis
AB In Hungary and Slovakia during 2010-2015 there has been an increase in xenophobic attitudes in society; right-wing and extremist groups are activating there as well. The purpose of this article is to compare the most significant factors which encourage xenophobia. Previously we have identified the types of right-wing organizations and found out their electoral characteristics. We assume that the activities of right-wing extremist organizations influence the formation of xenophobic social practices in Hungary and Slovakia, which arise from the range of factors. In this article we used empirical data gained as a result of public opinion polls conducted by the leading research centers in Hungary and Slovakia, by international organizations, as well as statistics of public authorities and civil society institutions. By means of factor analysis, we identified the main directions and forms of activity of right-wing radicals; determined the value of socio-economic dynamics of the country's development; characterized the attitude of society, the law and the ruling elite to the problems of xenophobia and right-wing radicalism. Among the most influential factors we identified: open propaganda of nationalist ideas; constitutional priority of the ethnic majority interests; parliamentary status of right-wing parties; condoning the activities of right-wing radicals by the ruling elite, the courts and the police. The comparison of factors stimulating xenophobic practices in Hungary and Slovakia didn't confirm the hypothesis of common significant influence of the economic crisis, lack of education and political passivity on the formation of xenophobic practices among young people. The professional frustration of provincial youth discovered itself as a cumulative socioeconomic factor.

DT Article
AB Images of the French Revolution were actively used in Bolchevik propaganda from the creation of this faction of the social democratic party in Russia. But it was above all after the Revolution of 1917 that the communist propagandists made references to the revolutionary experience of France the order of the day. Among the propagandists, Nicolai Loukine (1885-1940) was one of the most clever. A graduate in history from the University of Moscow, and one of the leaders of the Bolshevik party in this city, he actively employed images of the French Revolution in the articles he published in Bolchevik journals. It was he who mandated in 1918 to put in place a new system for the teaching of history in Soviet Russia; it was he also who founded Soviet historiography of the French Revolution. At the beginning of the 1930s, Loukine became the highest government official charged with overseeing historical research in the USSR. But at the time of the Great Stalinist Terror, he was arrested and died in detention. Yet his students played the principal roles in the realm of Soviet research on the French Revolution until the 1980s.

AB Studying the past of the Kalmyk people is considerably complicated by the fact that their nomadic lifestyle and dramatic developments they had to go through did not allow their own written records to survive in a sufficient way. Therefore, this adds still more value to the letters written by Kalmyk Khans and Kalmyk nobility to Russian Tsars which are kept in Russian state archives. A research on relations between the Kalmyk Khanate and the Russian State naturally raises the question: which of the Kalmyk epistolary documents preserved in the archives of Moscow institutions is the earliest one? For a long time it was believed that such document was the letter dated 1661which was written by Kalmyk ruler and overlord Daichin to Russian Tsar Alexey Mikhailovich. It was first published in 1966. The present article describes the unique archival find: a letter of Kalmyk ruler and overlord Luzan dated 1642 to Tsar Mikhail Fedorovich. The letter was discovered by the author in the Nogaisk Fund of the Russian State Archives of Ancient Documents. The fact that the letter was kept in the Nogaisk Fund may explain why Moscow historians-Mongolists failed to spot it as, back in the 1950s - 1960s, they were preparing documents on Russian-Mongolian relations in the 17th century to be published. Although Luzan's letter is rather short, it does reveal what the political and economic relations between the Russians and Kalmyks at that time were like. Moreover, it demonstrates the start of written traditions of the Kalmyk people.

AB The goal of this investigation is to show the inefficiency of the present-day strategy of passive confrontation with a threatening geo-ecological tendency, and to attract attention to creation and application of active defense technologies for dangerous environmental processes running out of control. The increase in quantity and scale of destroying geophysical events on the Earth relates to the problem of population and economic safety that require common coordination of protective efforts by different states. The objective of appropriate confrontation generates a need of many countries' participation, integration of their intellectual asset and material resources, and serves as a new factor of globalization. In this context, one should take into consideration a long-term global company the UN International Strategy of Disasters Risk Reduction - and also convocation of regular world forums in its course. Their resolutions and activities of executive structures established create a base for managing risks at the global level, assigned to provide development stable to disasters and temperature changes by joint achievements of the UN projects triad: Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, Agenda XXI and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. But, according to the actual overall result after 15 years of the Strategy's realization without authorized institutes and legal obligatory decisions, it has not given a meaningful effect. The analysis of its main documents and possibilities of typical present-day warning and reaction means demonstrates that both the existing institutional framework of cooperation in the emergency sphere and the resistance potential used nowadays cannot stop a dynamic increase in human victims and economic damage caused by nature. For efficient protection from natural disasters and consequences of neglected modifications of geophysical processes carried out by some countries, it is necessary to have not a recommendable, but an obligatory system of its regulation. A political plan of developing a new area of international cooperation and creating ways of its normative and institutional base construction for the future national interests is needed. Consideration of this problem aspect, which has not been researched enough, should promote objective evaluation of the critical situation in the fight against the consistently increasing threat which has global and inevitable character. At the same time, amid both geodynamics and social necessity, it is essential to accelerate creation of institutional and legislative regulations, to enhance global natural disaster risk management.

The goal of the study is to verify and show the capabilities of expert online survey in studying the issues of reforming the power and management hierarchy in conjunction with the data from official sources, representative field survey, content analysis of the regional media and online studying of network communities in regions with different levels of socio-cultural modernization, which are used as a whole in the study under a Russian Science Foundation grant. The paper presents summarized results of the initial stage (in four out of twelve regions of the Russian Federation) of this study aimed to obtain representative data on the work of government and management authorities in the context of socio-cultural modernization in individual regions, to identify relations that affect the functionality of regional administration systems, which determine the nature and level of their development, and the ability of regional power and management vertical to effectively solve socioeconomic problems. The authors pay attention to the question of methodological verification of expert opinions in the framework of comparing the data of socio-economic and socio-political ratings; the question is raised concerning the necessity of development and introduction of technology of communicative feedback between government and management authorities and the public. The main source of empirical data used in the article is the expert online survey conducted with the participation of the authors in 2015, one more source is the data on socio-economic and socio-political ratings of development of Russian regions in this period. The work, as part of a general research under the RSF grant, taking into account the published preliminary data, continued in the remaining eight regions in 2016-2017.

AB The Post-Soviet period provided new directions for sociology that changed together with Russian society. Sociological education became massive, theoretical pluralism promised new grounds, sources of funding multiplied; party control disappeared, while international ties expanded. Russian sociology was fully institutionalized. Gradually, it was turning into a "normal" social science. Alongside with quantitative growth, problems of quality in education and research became visible and were actively debated along with public sociology and its place in Russia. Several sociological associations were founded aiming to strengthen professional solidarity among sociologists; however, they contributed to increasing political fragmentation within the field.

AB The article analyzes the ideas that received the greatest popularity and actively participated in determining the fate of the 1917 revolution. The main ideological orientations that reflected the face of political space at that time are revealed. The characteristics of the leading political parties - the Russian National Union, the Party "Union of 17 October", the Party of People freedom, the Socialist-Revolutionaries, the Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks - are described. Ideas are considered from the point of view of the cardinal problems of Russian society: attitude to the war, the needs and aspirations of the main classes of Russia - working class and peasantry. Accordinly, an analysis of the social base of each of these parties is given. It is shown that only the Bolsheviks could formulate slogans reflecting aspirations of the masses: "The peace - to the peoples", "the factories - to the workers", "the land - to the peasants". It was these ideas that attracted the working class and the peasantry to side with the Bolsheviks, ensured transition of the main social strata of the people to their side and support of Bolshevik actions to seize and retain power, successful confrontation with other political forces and a victorious outcome of ensuing civil war.

AB Being based on the results of sociological monitoring, this study is focused on the problem of electoral preferences in contemporary Russian society. Particular attention is paid to the motivations and ideological orientations of voters in the State Duma elections of Russia of 2016. A theoretical and methodological basis of research is the set of provisions considering the electoral choice as a result of the influence of the ever-changing and interacting factors. It is shown that the majority of Russians are voting without being committed to any political ideas or political parties. The Communist Party and the "Yabloko" party have voters who are followers of party ideas to a greater extent. The party "United Russia", which won the elections, has the most ideologically diverse group of voters who are largely supporting President Putin. Administrative resource and, in fact, the state status of "United Russia", make Russians to perceive it as the only political force capable to realize interests of various sectors of society. But the victory of the "United Russia" is not associated with the perspectives of successful development of the country, as skeptical assessments of the election results suggest.

In the author's opinion, one of the obstacles to the development of cooperation between Germany and China in this area different perception of the nature of human rights.

AB The article studies the influence of economic factors on the electoral behavior of Russians during the federal parliamentary elections in 2003-2016. The conducted research proved the existence of the so-called "Putin contract", but also revealed a number of patterns that partially contradict initial assumptions. According to their statistical model, in dynamics economic voting in Russia manifests itself as an exchange of population's loyalty for medium-term economic growth and lower poverty levels. However, this is different from "voting with your wallet" and seeking immediate benefits, which, according to R. Turovsky and Yu. Gaivoronsky, partly explains the absence of the negative trend in the performance of the "United Russia" in 2016 elections: two years of crisis were not enough for the electorate to lose trust in current power that earned a certain level of credibility.

AB This article considers J.S. Bach who lived and worked in Leipzig since 1723, his interest in Dresden and the reasons for it. The capital of Saxony attracted the composer's attention in both creative field (with its cosmopolitanism and stylistic variety) and political one. Because of the aggravation of relations with the Leipzig magistrate, Johann Sebastian decided to enlist the support of the royal court and wrote several cantatas on allegiance texts to the family celebrations of Friedrich August I and his son Friedrich August II. In 1733 J.S. Bach sent the royal chancellery petition for awarding him the title of the court composer, joining the set of performing parts of Kyrie and Gloria (Missa BWV 232/I) with a dedication to the Elector to the petition. Attaching features of grand polonaise (it had an extraordinary popularity in Saxony) to multiple parts of Gloria (in particular, the bass aria "Quoniam tu solus sanctus"), J.S. Bach symbolically glorified the monarch who was fighting over the Polish crown at that time.

AB In the late 19th - early 20th centuries more than a half of the Kostroma province's population was represented by women. By 1917 women made about 65 % of the population. Their activity had a significant impact on the result of revolutionary events. The most widespread women's movement was organized in Kostroma - once a provincial centre. In this very city vivid personalities of women-revolutionaries were shaped, and their role in the protest movement was determined. They were involved in illegal movement of the populists, took part in the Marxist sections, but they played a more active role in the labour movement. On the other hand, all political parties in Russia tried to attract women to their side. In Kostroma these parties included the cadets, the social revolutionaries, the Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks. The year of 1917 was marked by the strongest battle for the influence on women. The special attention was paid to those women whose husbands fought or died in the First World War, since many of them lived in Kostroma. In the course of the struggle women preferred the Bolsheviks' party. In Kostroma the power passed to them by peaceful means, mainly because the revolutionaries were mostly represented by women-workers. Thus, the participation of Russian women, particularly in the Kostroma province, in the revolutionary struggle of the early 20th century allows to see the mechanism of protest ideas generation and development in society, as well as to understand the power of specific political parties' certain ideas.

AB Deputy Nikolai Pavlovich Okulov is little-known to historical science. And yet his career was a good example of the opportunities that political system of the Russian Empire gave its ordinary citizens. While a student in Kazan, he, a member of a peasant family, entered an illegal circle for studying revolutionary literature. Graduating from the Kazan teacher's institute, he got a job in the Tsaritsyn town college, but got engaged in propaganda of radical ideas among the poorest town folk. Police discovered the plans of the revolutionary-inmaking, and he was arrested and sentenced to prison. After his liberation, the former teacher had to make a living by giving private lessons, writing articles for newspapers, and keeping records and accounts. Having become known to the domestic intelligence, he did not become a professional revolutionary. Having got a family and a job, he had to be guarded in his opinions and cautious in his actions. Nikolai Okulov succeeded in union activities and legal participation in national political life. Despite his misguided revolutionary youth and difficult financial situation, N. P. Okulov's energy and talent won elections to the State Duma of the 2nd convocation. Among the conditions of his electoral success, the author has been able to identify these main factors impeccable business reputation, support of the local intelligentsia and business circles, membership in the Labour Popular Socialist Party. The party program intended to replace monarchy by republic, socialize production, and construct socialism on the basis of obshchina. The article portrays N. P. Okulov as a journalist, trade union head, and politician. He was a politician of a new mould, one who framed socially significant program and sought public support. The author studies Okulov's work in the State Duma: commission for implementation of state revenues and expenses inventory and in the temporary commission for introduction of regulated time off for employees of trades and crafts. Parliamentary activities gave him an opportunity to accumulate political experience and build his career in the public government. And yet a complex of reasons prevented the first Tsaritsyn deputy from realizing his political potential. Previously unknown letters of N. P. Okulov reflect his fatigue and frustration resulting from the dissolution of the Duma. However, he remained useful in Tsaritsyn until 1917.

DE Cognitive science; cognitive approach; connectionism; research program;
   educational program
AB Cognitive sciences present an interdisciplinary synthesis of sciences, connected by one problem field. The main peculiarity and novation of cognitive science in the study of cognition is in the multidisciplinel dialogue, that creates a common ground of the philosophy of science, neuroscience, theory of information, linguistics, psychology. The relevance of the problem field of the cognitive research is determined also by the features of modern society in its development. This unity becomes possible in the modern conditions of the sixth technological order, that covers the development of nanotechnology along with the intense development of cognitive sciences. This mode is characterized firstly by the fact, that the informational society is changed to the society, based on knowledge, and the human now has such a powerful base of knowledge, such technological power, that its incorrect implication may cause very serious results. The science is gradually integrating into a newly organized system of interrelation between science and technology, the main feature of which is social practical focus. Let us draw our attention to the fact, that cognitive models and methodological approaches had widely spread in all the science itself, became important instruments of professionals in various fields, both in the research and practice. Without them, it is hard to imagine contemporary engineering sciences, theory of administration, medicine, pedagogics, sociology, political sciences, economy. In this connection, the higher education has a valuable aim to develop a complex approach, which could bring to a new quality level multidisciplinel research, including humanities, natural and precise sciences. And nowadays, the cognitive approach is used as this approach, and it also provides the solution for traditional problems of sciences, using the methods that include cognitive aspects. These aspects are formed of processes of perception, thinking, cognition, comprehension and decision making. That is why this approach is anthropologic and this is the first reason, why exactly the cognitive approach is necessary to use as the methodological base of the new educational program. The second reason the studying and research of cognitive sphere cannot be limited by one discipline, and the necessity of integration of cognitive research in various fields is growing. The fulfilling of this important task is impossible without the support of serious research program, as the named task of integration is far from solution nowadays, that is affected greatly by discipline borders.
   The report contains the problem field of the research program. The most important aspect of these researches is the reflection of owns methods of work and an attempt to relate them to cognitive problems. Also, the contents of the educational program are presented, that envisages, on one hand, the learning of exact disciplines, and on the other the learning of methodological strategies of adjacent disciplines. It is assumed, that specialists will be able to: think problematically, wisely choose the research strategies, establish interdisciplinary contacts basing upon some methodological and theoretical background, implement cognitive-oriented projects with the colleagues, specializing in various different fields of humanities, precise and natural sciences.

AB The latest realities (Brexit, the election of Donald Trump as the 45th President of the USA) presuppose a new approach to understanding of possible changes, to transformation of international political order in Europe at the present stage of post-bipolar period. This is an attempt to examine potential changes of the current Euro-Atlantic order outlines in Europe on the basis of the major actors' political courses modifications (the USA, Russia and Germany). Early in 1990s, many people assumed the possibility of a total democratic transformation of the whole political space from Vancouver to Vladivostok. Under current conditions of the relations worsening between the Russian Federation and the West (the Ukrainian crisis, the sanctions policy, Syrian events), one can see more viable constructions for the pan-European security system to create on the basis of Eurocentrism, by means of pragmatic harmonization between Germany and Russia providing that there will be an essential shift of the United States' strategic attention from Europe to the Asia-Pacific region, the Greater Middle East and the South Asia. The President V. Putin's impressive plan to revive Russia as a great power, to create its own zone of security in the "near abroad" provokes the corresponding nervousness and unpredictable consequences in the world arena. At the same time, the Russian Federation has a lot of huge structural problems which can also lead to crisis or even to some breaks. Germany continues its stable and long ascent to become an incontestable "center of power" in Europe (still without defining the European agenda), to reach the status of "an additional" superpower. Due to forthcoming changes in the U. S. foreign policy under D. Trump administration, it evidently must prepare to all alternatives. Quiet times have probably gone also for the integrating Europe which learns to live under conditions of a permanent crisis, in the zone of higher turbulence. The critical set of changes in geostrategic context on the continent may apparently change the order in Europe, or lead to destruction of old forms and genesis of different new forms.

AB The paper considers the problem of the Siberian region general crisis of the 1917 spring. The internal and external contradictions of the transformation process of socio-economic and political relations in Siberia are examined in terms of the post-February all-Russian revolutionary crisis development. The understanding of the socio-political Russian crisis in the spring of 1917, emerging after the February political coup, is essential in studying the revolutionary conversion process of the early twentieth century Russian society, as this crisis has generally become the turning point in the country's history and objectively led to the October political coup. The Russian revolutionary crisis constituents, its foreign and domestic manifestations require careful investigation in the issue formulation presented in the paper. The development specifics of the revolutionary crisis in the spring of 1917 in the trans-Uralian agricultural colony of the Russian Empire is of scientific interest, as well as the finding of its anti-crisis development scenarios in the paper presented period. The development of the nationwide crisis in Russia in the early twentieth century, due to the complex and contradictory processes of Russian society modernization in completing the industrial civilization and transition to the imperialist development stage, was complicated by the "Siberian historical issues" in the Siberian region. A set of these issues include the incompleteness of the regional peasantry land management, the contradictions between the old peasantry and Stolypin migrants, and also between the peasantry and the privileged regional Cossacks, the agricultural products export problems from Siberia to domestic and foreign markets, or marketing crisis, the contradictions between the regional and metropolis bourgeoisie, or the issue of the Siberians economic inequality, the local industry underdevelopment and the complete dependence of the local population on the factory products supplying from European Russia, or supply crisis, the lack of a country council, or the administrative inequality of Siberia as a colony and metropolis, etc. During the First World War, these problems worsened and led Siberia to a revolutionary situation. Started in Russia in February 1917, the revolution was an attempt to solve the " Siberian historical issues" personally by the regional population, whose social activity ultimately led to an acute socio-political crisis of Siberia, which became a part of the national post-February revolutionary crisis.

AB The article focuses on the analysis of the manuscript of Jan Potocki which was founded in the archives of the St. Petersburg Institute of History (Russian Academy of Sciences). It is the translation into French of some parts of the << Chronicon terrae Prussiae >> by Peter of Dusburg. This translation was used by Potocki for his research in the East European history. Notes of translator contained in this manuscript shows that Potocki gave considerations to toponyms in his researches. Exploring the manuscript authors identified some sources used by Jan Potocki. To a considerable degree his notes were based on the remarks of Christophor Hartknoch, the first editor of << Chronicon terrae Prussiae >>. Other source of information was the appendix of the map of Prussia made by historian and cartographer of 16th century Caspar Hennenberger. A drawing attention to toponyms was one of a characteristic features of Potocki's works, in view of sphere of his interest - the history of ethnos. Moreover, Potocki offered a specific representation of the Middle Ages considered as a interlink between Antiquity and the Modern time. Potocki underlined the continuity of toponyms. According to Potocki, analysis of toponyms, gives an indication of the settlement borders between particular ethnic groups. Chronicles written at various times allow to reveal the details of continuity and borrowing the place names of some words by different ethnical groups from each other. Potocki used various dictionaries, as well as lists of words that he has made during his travels in order to establish the linguistic trees from ancient to contemporary languages. Jan Potocki considered the Eastern Europe region not from the position of contemporary national borders, but in terms of << Sarmatia >>. The study of the region, as a whole, without allocation of internal political boundaries could be inspired by the theory of Sarmatism.

DE small and medium enterprises; entrepreneurial potential; real sector
AB Entrepreneurship is a socio-economic institutional system that harmonizes private and public interests under regulations established by law. In response to modern economic, geographic and political challenges, the study of entrepreneurship has become an urgent issue due to the possible use of its feature: flexibility with regard to market changes and innovations. The efficient performance of entrepreneurship depends on combination of the following factors: climatic, geographical, cultural, historical, administrative, and technological. Thus, on the one hand, the entrepreneurial potential at the regional level is the sum of all opportunities and measures available in a specific region at a certain period of time. On the other hand, the growth of entrepreneurial potential in the regions relies on the quantitative and qualitative development of the small and medium enterprises. Therefore, the entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial potential of the region are interdependent categories that determine the existence of each other. The opportunities available in the region for the activities of small and medium businesses promote its efficiency, which in turn forms the entrepreneurial potential of the region. There is an increasing trend in the number of small and medium enterprises in the servile sector of economy in Russia nowadays, which impedes the development of the real sector. The reasons of this trend include the methodology used to assess the entrepreneurial potential in the regions. Thus, this study considers that the entrepreneurial potential should be assessed from the perspective of the possibilities of small and medium enterprises in the real sector of economy. The subject of research is the entrepreneurship as a socio-economic phenomenon and the entrepreneurial potential in the territories. The objective of work is to apply the developed grouping of statistical indicators that allow describing the subject of research at the most informative level. The methodological tools of the work rely on the application of methods of statistical and cause-effect analysis. The major result of the work is a general description of the entrepreneurship in the regional real sector of economy, which is a combination of economic efficiency and public utility of entrepreneurial activity.

AB This article is devoted to the motif of Schism in Fyodor Dostoyevsky's The House of the Dead. The analysis marks the interaction of The House. with the essays of the 1860s. While depicting the meek image of an old schismatic (Rus. raskolnik), Dostoyevsky exaggerated the seriousness of his crime in order to emphasise his rebellious potential. This echoes Dostoyevsky's controversy with the Westernisers and Slavophiles in his essay Two Camps, where in the advocates of the Schism, he sees aspiration for truth, which he considers a pledge of hope for the future in Russian life. In the depiction of prison runaways (Rus. beguny) in The House., one can see the possible impact of A. P. Shchapov's article on sectarian runaways: in both works, escape is understood in the first place as a form of popular protest. The need for suffering in The House. is not characteristic of the runaways, but of the old schismatic and another prisoner. Moreover, nothing is said about the purifying function of suffering, which is one of the most important topics of Dostoyevsky's later works. The schismatic and runaways in The House. foreshadow Makar Dolgoruky in Dostoyevsky's The Raw Youth. However, the schismatic's ambivalent image is still far from Makar's ideal image. The paradoxical image of the latter became the basis of a series of characters of Dostoyevsky's later works, in whom "haughtiness" is combined with "meekness".

AB The paper discusses evaluation in public political speech (as illustrated by the political speech of German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt). Various approaches to the study of evaluation, the nature and typology of evaluation are considered; the study of an evaluative situation involving obligatory and optional components is conducted: a subject of evaluation, an object of evaluation, content of evaluation, a reason of evaluation and a recipient -a component that is vital from the viewpoint of pragmatics. The rules and principles of public political speech composition and the components of speech composition considered in the science of eloquence -rhetoric -are analyzed (N. A. Bezmenova, Yu. V. Rozhdestvensky, E. N. Zaretskaya, I. A. Sternin, et al.). Public political speech is sequentially structured with a certain sequence of the speech composition components. Each component of the speech structure consists of the composition-speech forms: narration, description and reasoning (argumentation) (O. A. Nechaeva, N. V. Bessmertnaya, M. P. Brandes, S. K. Shendels, K. A. Andreeva). Argumentation is a composition-speech form of the public political speech structure, i. e. a set of arguments, a way of producing them to justify a certain statement. A linguistic analysis of the principal means of expressing the attitudinal meaning in one of the most striking speeches of German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt is carried out based on the developed model.

AB The existing scientific discourse influences not only the modern science growth vector, but a certain view on the heritage of past perception as well. Most of the fundamental works that address the ideas of K.D. Ushinskij were written in Soviet times. Scrutinizing the philosophical and socio-political views of the great teacher, researchers, mainly aimed at detecting the manifestation of materialistic ideas. Owing to the search for new ways of developing the system of national education, contemporary authors appeal to K.D. Ushinskij's concept of "nationality" ("narodnost") more and more often. However, (due to the difference between the cultural vocabularies of the nineteenth and the twenty-first centuries), for a proper interpretation of this concept, a complex analysis of K.D. Ushinskij's views on the problems of theory and history is necessary. Such analysis has not been conducted before. By using the theoretical and methodological approaches of modern cultural studies, the paper aims at filling this lack of information by presenting an analytical overview of key culturological themes presented in the K.D. Ushinskij's works. These are the semantic fields of the concepts "culture", "civilization", "nationality", the typology of cultures, the concept of the development of culture as a gradual transition from syncretism of all spheres of culture to their system-functional organization, the concept of a non-linear, multivariate process of human development and the historical unity of the various pedagogical systems' of European origin. Although it is impossible to provide an exhaustive analysis of the entire heritage of K.D. Ushinskij in one article, still the results obtained could significantly extend the horizon of understanding K.D. Ushinskij's philosophical and pedagogical ideas and might be beneficial to further researches both in the field of the history of pedagogy and the history of Russian cultural studies. Refs 22.

AB The creation of the Comintern and the formation of the Communist concept of war and peace in the conditions of the Versailles system of international relations are considered. The topic urgency is determined by the fact that the problem of international tensions today is extremely sharp again. The author notes that the search for a new model of world order and a peaceful transition to it makes the appeal to the experience of the past important. The novelty of the research lies in the fact that the coverage of issues of war and peace in the documents of the Comintern in Russian historiography is only beginning to be explored, there have been no fundamental works on this topic yet. The article presents a comparative analysis of democratic and Communist views on the creation of a new system of international relations. Great attention is paid to the work of the I Congress of the Communist Internationale, which laid the foundations of the policies of the international Communist movement. The differences in tactical questions of the Communist Western social democracy, and the differences between "right-wing" and "left-wing" of the Comintern are analyzed. The author comes to the conclusion that, despite the revolutionary rhetoric, the Bolshevik leadership sought to make peace with the great powers and to establish economic relations with them. It is mentioned that the theoretical position of the Communists was adjusted depending on the practical interests of the Soviet state.

AB The paper analyzes staffing of the Soviet studies of the Arctic islands and archipelagos in 1920-1940 on the basis of a complex of archival materials and published sources. The peculiarities of personnel screening, training and motivation of scientific expeditions and polar stations are studied. Staffing system, which was formed in 1920-1940 period of the staffing system of the national scientific activities in the Arctic, which had not been carried out on a regular basis before the Russian revolution. The beginning of the 1920s was characterized by the lack of specialized training programs, poor conditions of wintering, low salaries and poor-quality supply of food and clothing for polar scientists. The successes of that period were provided mainly by professionalism and enthusiasm of experienced researchers-heads of the scientific institutions (R. Samoylovich, V. Vize, N. Matusev-ich, I. Mesyatsev). In the prewar decade after the establishment of the Main Directorate of the Northern Sea Route an effective system of the Soviet Arctic research staffing was created. It included the selection and motivation of polar explorers through the Communist party, development of special educational programs for researchers, introduction of new forms of work organization, benefits and material support for workers beyond the Arctic Circle, high social status of Arctic explorers. However, talented scientists and managers along with other polar explorers suffered in the result of political repressions of the 1930s, which had a negative impact on the development of the Soviet polar scientific school.

Peculiarities of trade with oil and oil products between Russia and China are shown from the point of view of Chinese economic and political science. Separately the possibilities of development of international cooperation between the oil industry of Russia and the People's Republic of China are characterized, especially in the context of the concept of "Economic zone of the New Silk Road". It is suggested that the concept of "One zone, one road" (New Silk Road) will actively promote the development of trade relations and economic ties between Russia, China and CIS countries. It is noted that greater investment in the oil and gas sector of the Russian economy is promising for China. The author believes that the participation of the Chinese party in the production and processing of Russian oil will significantly increase economic relations between Russia and China in the oil industry. Modern Chinese researchers emphasize that China is interested not only to buy ready-made products in the Russian oil industry, but also to participate in the production and processing of Russian oil, and it reinforces the mutual interest of Russia and China in the development of this sector of the economy.

DE Russia; modernization; civilization; primary and secondary stages of
   modernization; sociological research; political dissonance
AB The Atlas of Russia's modernization, operating with phenomena and concepts with unclear boundaries and deep meaning, gives them spatially systematized data that form the very idea of the objects under study. The authors widely used heuristic approach, which only allows you to operate with such hardly predictible processes and trends as modernization and its state in the Russian regions and in Russia as a whole. More specifically, we are talking about the civilizational approach, supplemented and concretized by the results of more than 70 sociological studies of modernization in almost one third of the subjects of the Russian Federation. The authors analyzed the internal challenges facing Russia, the answer to which should be modernization. For the first time in the study of modern Russian society, the Atlas represents modernization as a measurable, comparable and voluminous process. The Atlas draws a stage picture of the development of modern Russian society - at the exit from the industrial (primary) stage of modernization and preparation for entry into the information (secondary) stage. At this stage of modernization, the seemingly socio-cultural, but in fact - political discord of the modern Russian civilizational process will be overcome, and a humanistically oriented way of life for a large community of people in the northeastern part of the continent of Eurasia is approved, as an illustration of a possible new civilizational project for humanity.

TI Concerning History of the Establishment of Russian Diplomatic Missions

   North Africa
AB The article studies the establishment of Russian diplomatic missions in the Maghreb (Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia) in late 18th - 19th century. Studying the outset of the Russian-Arab relations is a significant task for both science and diplomacy. Although there are several works dating from the Soviet era, the issue remains little-studied. The article draws on the documents from the Archive of Foreign Policy of the Russian Empire, some already published, others introduced into scientific use for the first time. Analysis of archival sources allows to consider the problem of first contacts of the Russian Empire and the Maghreb states in its entirety, to identify Russian interests in each of three countries, to define important internal and external factors that prompted the countries to establish relations. The author has revealed that at the first stage of the Russian-Maghreb relations its economic component had a priority: foreign representatives in the Maghreb were enlisted as non-staff Russian consuls in order to protect the interests of seamen-merchants trading in the Mediterranean under the Russian flag. At the second stage priority was given to the political component in the Russian-Maghreb relations. The great power directly involved in the settlement of the Eastern Question, the Russian Empire had to consider Algerian, Tunisian and Moroccan factors in setting its European agenda. The Russian government saw the Barbary states of Algeria and Tunisia as formally belonging to the Ottoman Empire. Russian political interest in these countries strengthened as the European powers, primarily, France and Great Britain, were fighting to establish their influence, and Turkey strived to preserve its sovereignty. Although it remained independent throughout the 19th century, Morocco also was an object of the European powers' rivalry. Russian diplomatic missions in Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco were established with an eye toward keeping track of all twists and turns of the European powers fighting over the North African colonies and in order use this factor in setting its own agenda.

AB In the work the reasons of formation of the Russian position in relation to the French colonial conquests in North' Africa in XIX the beginning of the 20th centuries are investigated. Consecutive consideration of sources, the course and consequences of the French penetration into Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco allows to define value of this region in the European policy during the specified period. The Russian political interest in the countries of the Maghreb has been connected with fierce fight of the European powers, first of all France, Great Britain and Germany for strengthening of the influence, and also Turkey for preservation of domination over Barbarian provinces. Russia, without having any claims to the Maghreb, nevertheless, has been forced to correct the policy taking into account a colonial factor which had notable consequences for all system of the international relations. The fundamental moment in definition of the Russian political pOsitions on colonial conquests of France in the Maghreb was the all-European factor, fight of powers within the Eastern Question. Besides the analysis of an official position of the government of the Russian Empire on the matter, in article reaction of the Russian public opinion to events in the Maghreb is considered. Work is based on archival sources documents of the Archive of foreign policy of the Russian Empire and publications of the Russian press of the 19th century.

DT Article
DE Yevgeny Vakhtangov; Vsevolod Meyerhold; directors; theatrical geniuses;
   October Revolution; myth; revolutionary scene; creativity; alternative
AB This article considers revolution as a political clash and revolutionism as an aesthetic position, which is a topic inspired by the philosophical, social, and aesthetic experience of the twentieth century. This topic has been considered on the eve of the 100-year anniversary of the October Revolution. The author proceeds from the claim that one of the theatrical geniuses, Vsevolod E. Meyerhold, was, above all, a man of politics, while the other, Yevgeny B. Vakhtangov, was first and foremost a man of art. The revolutionary pathos of Vakhtangov's work is paradoxically actualized through the concept of myth and compassion as an alternative to cruelty and destruction. The personality of Meyerhold is described within the context of the revolutionary scene and in the unique mode of revolutionary nature and action. The experience of these theatrical geniuses in all their personal contradictions and artistic difference shows that it is possible to live during a time of revolution, but it is impossible to live in a constant state of revolution. Only creativity, as a source of hope and harmony, is an alternative to chaos and destruction.

TI The Royal Art: Coat of Arms as Religious and Political Allegories in
   Alchemical Treatise "Book of the Holy Trinity"
SO ISTORIYA-ELEKTRONNYI NAUCHNO-OBRAZOVATELNYI ZHURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Middle Ages; Germany; alchemy; forgers; heraldry; iconography
AB The article is devoted to analysis of symbolic pictures and coat of arms, which are found in the iconography of medieval alchemical treatises in the XV century. A visual analogy between Christ's resurrection and the Philosopher's Stone, a comparison of the crucifixion with the coat of arms of the Holy Roman Empire became important parts of allegorical images of the famous alchemical treatise "Book of the Holy Trinity". Many researchers have linked this iconographical turn with the papal bull against the alchemists made by Pope John XXII in 1317. According to the document, alchemists could be punished for the extraction of fake gold using philosopher's stone. Perhaps this very bull was the impetus for iconographical and textual mixing of alchemical and Christian paradigms. Using of imperial heraldry could be done to praise the ruler. For iconographic expression of this idea author, frater Ulmann, who was German and Franciscan monk, depicted Jesus literally growing out of the Holy Roman Empire arms. Ulmann has mixed the coat of arms and the image of Christ for the first time in the context of medieval European iconography. There are another coat of arms in the treatise: one of them holds so-called wilde Frau, another represents the shield of the Trinity (coat of Mary, surrounded by mandorla, prays at the crucifixion of Jesus in the shape of fleur de lis. Alchemist called this heraldic flower "the lily of seven virtues": its petals were compared with the seven metals, planets and the wounds of Christ. Blooming Cross could mean the proximity of the Resurrection of Jesus, and in the alchemical sense - the transformation of "dead" metals into philosopher's stone. It is obvious that these alchemical arms helped the author to link firmly three contexts: religious, political, and alchemical. Thus, the author not only cleared himself of suspicion of heresy, but also legitimized alchemy as a serious science that was directly related to the politics and religion.
